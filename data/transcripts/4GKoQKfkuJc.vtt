the bill this simply removes cannabis
 
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 align:start position:0%

this bill on legalization in general

i was not able to attend the hearing on
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
reading testimony is my least favorite
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
form of presenting but i'm operating out
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
for about three hours of sleep right now
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
d8 to provide overall comments regarding
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
the legalization of cannabis
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
we are at the point where data is
 
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
available from other states to evaluate
 
00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
how legalization has impacted their
 
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
respective areas
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
while some perceive new hampshire as
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
lagging in legalization as compared to
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
surrounding states i view this as an
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to evaluate the effects of
 
00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.550 align:start position:0%
opportunity to evaluate the effects of
legalization

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
and to avoid some of the most concerning
 
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
in places like colorado and washington
 
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
where legalization has been underway for
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
some time we can see how it's playing
 
00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.270 align:start position:0%
some time we can see how it's playing
out

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
according to a variety of studies to
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
include a 2016 report by the rocky
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
mountain high intensity drug trafficking
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
area which is an agency
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
tasked with documenting the impact of
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
legalization in colorado here are some
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the results
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis related traffic deaths have
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
increased by 48 percent
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
youth marijuana use has increased by 20
 
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
percent in the two years following
 
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.189 align:start position:0%
percent in the two years following
legalization

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis related emergency room visits
 
00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
nearly doubled two years after
 
00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.629 align:start position:0%
nearly doubled two years after
legalization

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
child welfare related cases increased
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
after legalization
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
there was a marked increase in babies
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
being born with thc in their bloodstream
 
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
which primarily affected
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
communities of color and low-income
 
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.390 align:start position:0%
communities of color and low-income
families

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
five years after cannabis sales began in
 
00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 align:start position:0%
washington the number of accidental
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
ingestion of cannabis by young children
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
essentially tripled
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
and across the united states we can see
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
the effects as well uh as far as
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
childhood exposure to cannabis edibles
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
in 2016 those numbers were 187.
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the number rose to 3 000
 
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.309 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the number rose to 3 000
annually

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
annually
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
in a survey by the substance abuse and
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
mental health administration the results
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
detect uh detected a significant
 
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
increase in youth marijuana use in
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
legalized states
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
during a time when mental in mental
 
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
health indicators actually worsened
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
in our neighbor vermont the southwestern
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
vermont healthcare system
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
actually recently started reporting a
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
rise in cannabis related stomach
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
disorders this is due to the high thc
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
levels contained in today's cannabis
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
which then gets stored in body fat and
 
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.830 align:start position:0%
which then gets stored in body fat and
accumulates

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
accumulates
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
until a patient experiences severe
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
abdominal pain persistence and sometimes
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
uncontrollable vomiting for up to a week
 
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
one of the other examples that we have
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
is oklahoma oklahoma actually does not
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
have legalized cannabis actually
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
oklahoma does it permits the use of
 
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.350 align:start position:0%
oklahoma does it permits the use of
growing

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
and the use of medical marijuana
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
this is a little close to home for me
 
00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:45.110 align:start position:0%
this is a little close to home for me
because

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
i moved here from oklahoma it was my
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
last one of our last military
 
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.230 align:start position:0%
last one of our last military
assignments

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
assignments
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
i actually work as a hazard mitigation
 
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
planner in my day job and every day i
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
talk to county emergency managers in
 
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.270 align:start position:0%
talk to county emergency managers in
oklahoma

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
oklahoma
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's happened there
 
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.629 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's happened there
is

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly these emergency managers
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
are reporting the same issue
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
oklahoma's cannabis laws have attracted
 
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
a massive influx of organized crime into
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
their rural areas
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
some of the most rural areas now have a
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
definite definitive presence of russian
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
chinese and mexican cartels operating
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
farms under legal protections
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
worse yet many of these farms are
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
repeatedly sold multiple times a year at
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
top dollar
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
and most emergency managers recognize
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
and understand that this is just a legal
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
way for people to launder money for
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
these cartels then to launder money by
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
continually selling the same farm over
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
and over again to somebody else within
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
this actually happened to oklahoma
 
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.790 align:start position:0%
this actually happened to oklahoma
overnight

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
it has been shocking to them it's been
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
shocking to the emergency personnel
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
there at how fast the rural quiet areas
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
of oklahoma have been upturned
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
there are many unintended consequences
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
that accompany cannabis legalization
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
what is particularly concerning is that
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
if any proposal that calls for
 
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.509 align:start position:0%
if any proposal that calls for
legalization

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
18 years and above
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
there is still a well-documented
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
prolific information out there that
 
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrates negative effects of
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
repeated cannabi cannabis use on brain
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
function of young adults into their late
 
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.190 align:start position:0%
function of young adults into their late
20s

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
20s
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
and with that comes many negative mental
 
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
health consequences to include long-term
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
depression increased suicidal ideation
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
and increased
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
instances of mental health disorders
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
there's data out there it's it's just
 
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.190 align:start position:0%
there's data out there it's it's just
fact

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
i know that there are individuals on
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
both sides of the political aisle here
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire who think that
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
legalization uh
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
of cannabis should happen because it's
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
already been legalized by our
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
part of the pro-legalization messaging
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
promises that cannabis will reduce drug
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
offenses be a tool for social justice
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
reduce black market selling and provide
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
a more regulated and safer product for
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
adult users the fact is that we're
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
already seeing the data coming out of
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
out of other states
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
not only is legalization not living up
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
to any of its promises
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
states who have legalized it are seeing
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
more unintended consequences that are
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
putting the majority of their citizens
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
at state
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
at stake
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's not in
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimony is that there is a gentleman
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
named robert
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
corey and he's a lawyer in colorado who
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
actually played a pivotal role in the
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
movement of legalizing marijuana there
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
he helped draft amendment 64 which
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
permitted the production and retail
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
sales of recreational cannabis in 2012.
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
he also designed and implemented their
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
dispensary framework and
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
for patients and caregivers under
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
amendment 20. he's a trial attorney he's
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
represented hundreds of clients accused
 
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.990 align:start position:0%
represented hundreds of clients accused
of

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana related offenses and he
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
litigated cases and administrative
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
actions involving amendment 64's
 
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.829 align:start position:0%
actions involving amendment 64's
implementation

00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
yet nearly a decade after colorado has
 
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
yet nearly a decade after colorado has
implemented

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
implemented
legalization

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
this is what a quote that he said in
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
i wish i could be proud of what we
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
created but i'm not
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
the outcome of 64 is shameful
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
so i just want to leave us with this
 
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.990 align:start position:0%
so i just want to leave us with this
thought

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
if you think that new hampshire should
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis to emulate its
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
then we are not living up to our promise
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
of being independent thinkers
 
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
if you think we should legalize because
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
you feel it hap it will happen sooner or
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
later then we're seeding control of the
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
issue and ignoring the factual
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
information that has emerged from other
 
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.670 align:start position:0%
information that has emerged from other
states

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
if we think we should legalize because
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
some adults want to use cannabis then we
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
are forgetting that our greatest
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
responsibility in life is to ensure the
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our children before
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
our own self-interest
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
if you think that we should legalize
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis just because it will put a few
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
more shekels in the general fund
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
than shame on us all
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
there being no questions thank you for
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
all right at that point then i will
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
having heard um various uh positive
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
sounds from the committee i'm gonna go
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
ahead and open the executive session on
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
and mr second
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
second by representative pratt
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
mr vice chairman i believe the sponsor
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
who spoke said it pretty clearly enough
 
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.509 align:start position:0%
who spoke said it pretty clearly enough
so

00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
we can move on
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
very good
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to speak
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
um in the past i have said
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
on the house floor
 
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.550 align:start position:0%
on the house floor
um

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll repeat that for anyone who
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
missed it
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
i am a child of the 60s
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
and it was uh in fact 1973 before i
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
found out
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%

1468 house bill 1468 legalizes marijuana
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
i think that is a much
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
better approach
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
than other bills
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
that have uh
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
come to the floor
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
or come through through other committees
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%

so that
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
the state can have
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%

that does not make any sense to me at
all

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
the state should not be involved
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
with selling
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%

good morning again house criminal
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
justice and public safety committee my
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
name is representative tony lebranch and
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
i represent the town of amherst i come
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
before you today to introduce house bill
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
1175 and act relative to recording
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
interactions with public officials
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
this is a simple bill which adds a
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
single sentence to rsa
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
570-a colon 2 which is new hampshire's
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
wiretapping and eavesdropping statue
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
which makes it a crime to record others
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
without their express consent now we can
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
all agree
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
that makes sense no one should be
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
recorded without their express consent
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
especially because in new hampshire we
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional right to privacy
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
the issue with the current statute
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
is that similar statutes in other states
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
have been ruled unconstitutional by
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
multiple federal courts including
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
including the first circuit of appeals
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
in boston
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
the issue with the current statute is
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
that it does not make an exemption for
 
00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:36.079 align:start position:0%
recording public officials which has
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
been ruled a constitutional right in
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
cases such as glick v cunniff
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
this bill would add that exemption to
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
statute and therefore make it
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional preventing the state and
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
local governments from unnecessary
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuits relating to constitutionality
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
of the existing statute
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
this bill has broad tripartisan support
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
and is a simple update to the existing
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
statute to make it conform to the first
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
circuit's decision in glick v conniff
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
and with that i asked that the committee
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
passed this bill with an ought to pass
 
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.470 align:start position:0%
passed this bill with an ought to pass
motion

00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
um i have a question
 
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.549 align:start position:0%
um i have a question
so

00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
by public officials um please give us a
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
definition of public official and you as
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
a as far as the bill goes
 
00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.710 align:start position:0%
a as far as the bill goes
so

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
my definition of a public official would
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
be anybody who's employed by the state
 
00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh state being any government in new
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire because i believe it's a
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
matter of transparency that
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
we know what they're doing with our tax
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
money what they're doing uh on behalf of
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire and i think
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
that it should be our constitution
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to record them
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
and if i allow myself a follow-up
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
um is there any notice requirement in
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
your bill in other words can you could a
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
member of the public walk up to one of
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
us on the street and secretly record a
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
conversation without letting us know
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
they were doing so
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh in this bill specifically thank you
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
for the question i'm simply just making
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
an exemption in the wiretapping statute
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
and not adding anything else in any
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
other statute it's just updating the
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
wiretapping statue because i know one of
 
00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
my constituents was charged with this
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
statue when
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
they recorded their interaction with the
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
police on their own property they will
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
speak to that incident in
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
the next person speaking uh
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
representative panelakis
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
excuse my voice but
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%

00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
grocery store and speak with one of my
 
00:51:37.319 --> 00:51:39.109 align:start position:0%
grocery store and speak with one of my
constituents

00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
about a bill or something that's going
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
on that they should be allowed to record
 
00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.950 align:start position:0%
on that they should be allowed to record
in

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.750 align:start position:0%
in
uh

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh this is
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
any uh employee
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
of any government in new hampshire
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to be recorded in this
 
00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:55.270 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to be recorded in this
bill

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
i believe they currently have that right
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
to record
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
representatives such as myself and
 
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.630 align:start position:0%
representatives such as myself and
yourself

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
but this bill does not uh say anything
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
about giving notice i believe that would
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
have to be a separate bill this just
 
00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
makes it not a class b felony felony or
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor to do so
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman and thank you
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
for uh your testimony and your bill i
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
wish my name was on it
 
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.510 align:start position:0%
wish my name was on it
uh

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.230 align:start position:0%
uh
to

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
if i understand correctly uh what the
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
last speaker said if you could answer
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
yes or no on it i think in public
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
we can record
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding yes all right
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman yes all right
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is it's
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
so i have my town clerk my chief of
 
00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.309 align:start position:0%
so i have my town clerk my chief of
police

00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
police
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
if i go visit them during
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
their work day
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will allow me to videotape
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
them now if i go to their house
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
after their work day
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
the current law would still pertain and
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
i couldn't videotape them at that point
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
because they are off duty is that
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct and i will even
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
go further and just read the the simple
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
sentence that we're adding to this rsa
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
it just says a person
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
adding the exception to the current
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
wiretapping statute saying that a person
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
to record a public official in public
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
while the public official is in the
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
process of performing his or her duties
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
so it is only when they are on the clock
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
working for the state that they can be
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
recorded in public
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
and mr chairman one more last follow-up
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
i've talked to the aclu about putting
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
this bill in in the past i've talked to
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
about wiping out that provision
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
because in vermont where i came from we
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
can record single consent
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
they keep saying that this is the way to
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
keep it
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
for personal use but they do support at
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
that time i was wondering if you know if
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
they still support
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
doing this particular bill
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh it was my
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
i don't believe anybody's here to
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
testify on their behalf but it is my
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that this
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
is supported by them yes all right thank
 
00:54:32.319 --> 00:54:35.589 align:start position:0%
is supported by them yes all right thank
you

00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um if if the definition
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
actually includes all employees would it
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
include for example
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
someone like an active duty firefighter
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
in the process of actually fighting a
 
00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.510 align:start position:0%
in the process of actually fighting a
fire

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
fire
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
my question is is there are
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh employees in in government whose
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
duties involve things that are hazardous
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
or dangerous
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
and having other people
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
get in the way of those activities can
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if you could come
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
able to have a corridor around a crime
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
scene or a fire it would just mean that
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
they could be recorded without fear of
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
prosecution under the existing statute
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
we see you know fires on the nightly
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
news on wmur but the wmur is not being
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
charged for violating that wiretapping
 
00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.910 align:start position:0%
charged for violating that wiretapping
statute

00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
so in that specific case i believe that
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
that right is already guaranteed that
 
00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
they can record firefighters police
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
officers and other
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
public officials
 
00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.630 align:start position:0%
public officials
without

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative spelling
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you to the
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
member for taking my question
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
um in the process of putting one of my
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
bills together for this session i had
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
spoken with a lot of parents who've had
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
interactions with dcyf
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
and i see this as a situation where
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
this would be extremely useful if
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
dcyf employees in the course of
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
interviewing parents whether in an
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
attorney's office or not could not
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
refuse to be recorded
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
and currently the situation is that a
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
lot of them are walking off and refusing
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
to do the interview until there's no
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
recording and
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
if it's not in an attorney's office we
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
run into potential complicated problems
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
if the parent insists on recording would
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand the question
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
dcyf is a is a public employee and this
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
would allow the parents being
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
interviewed to
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
legally record them in the process of
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
their duties which would be the
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
interview with the parents would it not
 
00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.910 align:start position:0%
interview with the parents would it not
uh

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
in that specific circumstance i believe
 
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.270 align:start position:0%
in that specific circumstance i believe
that

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
they aren't exercising their public
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
duties and that anybody should be
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to record them in the process of
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
those duties thank you
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
um so you would consider
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
yourself and all public officials or
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
elected officials as part of this
 
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.109 align:start position:0%
elected officials as part of this
correct

00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
anybody that is employed by the state
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i as representatives we are
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
considered employees of the state so it
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
would apply to anybody that receives a
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
dime from
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
any state
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
or local government here in new
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative penalakis
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question but you
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
expressed that it would be when they
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
were off duty like a police a fire or us
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
i don't ever think there's a time that
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
a police officer is off duty or a
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislator is off duty
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
so how would we get around that
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
to the point about police officers there
 
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.069 align:start position:0%
to the point about police officers there
is

00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
you do punch out every day
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
and there is a time that you are off
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
duty of course you know
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
an off-duty cop could intervene in a
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
situation and if they see it fit you
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
know if they're in a convenience store
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
and it gets robbed they could
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
technically uh stop somebody but in that
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
case they're
 
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
usually in a public situation that's
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
already being recorded by convenience
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
store cameras uh so i
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything wrong in that
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
specific situation and for legislators
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
specifically i believe we already uh the
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
people already have a right to record us
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
at uh
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
when we're in the public that is the
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
the real important definition to see
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
here is that
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
if we're shopping at market basket or if
 
00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.230 align:start position:0%
if we're shopping at market basket or if
we're

00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know doing our day-to-day duties
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
we're still being uh
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're in the public eye constantly and
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
they already have a constitutional right
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
to record us
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:09.270 align:start position:0%

um according to how you just stated
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
anyone who is
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
employed by the state i assume then that
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
that it would extend to teachers
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
on every aspect of the day including bus
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
duty in the classroom coaching
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities as advisor
 
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
even on field trip
 
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:33.670 align:start position:0%
even on field trip

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
in thank you for the question in my
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bill that could be
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
a possibility uh
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
i hadn't thought about it but that is
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.270 align:start position:0%

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
elaine
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
sorry that was the exact question i had
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
i i was more concerned about a teacher
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
in a classroom and students being
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
recorded in the background and students
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
being involved and how would we deal
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
with that in in a teacher by this broad
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
broad bill which i agree with but i also
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
think there might be some unintended
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
consequences i'm trying to figure out
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
how we would deal with that and what
 
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
your opinion is of that
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
it could be amended as to excluding
 
01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.990 align:start position:0%
it could be amended as to excluding
schools

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
but i do not have any language that i
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
would amend it to at the moment that i
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
would be more than happy to find
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
sign language that would uh make that
 
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.510 align:start position:0%
sign language that would uh make that
exemption

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
there be no further questions thank you
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%

hampshire and right to know new
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire supports this bill which would
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
allow a person to record interactions
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
with public officials in the furtherance
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
of their duties
 
01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
installing video cameras in public
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
buildings has become commonplace
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
as it stands now for rsa 91a section 2
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
anyone just not local residents
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
must be permitted to attend a public
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
meeting and they can take notes tape
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
record take photos and videotape
 
01:01:58.309 --> 01:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
the focus of my testimony is going to be
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
in public buildings
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
video recording employees performing
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
public duties in public areas would
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
allow the public access to information
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
to determine if records are being
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
handled correctly or if their treatment
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
is equitable it would permit a official
 
01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
our interpretation of public officials
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
would include public employees and
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
elected appointed officials
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
our interpretation of video recording
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
would include audio and video recording
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
the recording can only be done in public
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
spaces with people operating in the
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
furtherance of their official duties
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities can video record no audio
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
in public places without noticing the
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
public letting them know
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
i wondered if there's a legal obligation
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
to inform a person if they're being
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
videotaped in a public building and if
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's a statute that should be added
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
to the document if that exists i'm not
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
certain it does but that's one of my
 
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.950 align:start position:0%
certain it does but that's one of my
questions

01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
in december i just want to share with
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
you a personal experience
 
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
several years ago i started
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
investigating the assessing office in
 
01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.230 align:start position:0%
investigating the assessing office in
nashua

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
and i just finished a trial in
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
my a right to know lawsuit suit that
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
went to court against the city of nashua
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
one of the claims was for video camera
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
security footage that was created in the
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
public customer service area of the
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
assessing office there were three
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
specific times and dates i wanted
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
this video camera
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
upon investigating the office the office
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
was set up the public service space with
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
a white board on the wall that would
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
show you when the assessor signed in and
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
out to go out and review properties
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
after i started questioning whether some
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
of one of our assessors was actually
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
performing those duties based on the
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
whiteboard the city removed the
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
whiteboard from the wall the very next
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
day they mounted a video camera in the
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
ceiling to video record public people in
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
this public space
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
in september
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
of 2019 i made a series of requests for
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
three pieces of film footage
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
i requested the recording because i
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
believed i was being treated differently

case cases violation of my
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights saying that higher
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
courts had already come to a conclusion
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
on this matter but the judge didn't take
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
it he said and i quote it doesn't matter
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
this is a statutory court not a
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional court and that's the line
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
that ultimately convinced me to pursue
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
this change um i reached in no prosecco
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
um in 2017 the city of manchester paid
 
01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.269 align:start position:0%
um in 2017 the city of manchester paid
him

01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
275 thousand dollars to settle the
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that he filed um i urge you to
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
recommend ought to pass on this bill and
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
to protect granite staters from
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional wiretapping charges
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
especially as police accountability and
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
general public official accountability
 
01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
um has become an increasingly
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
an increasingly relevant topic in
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
everyday life
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
and to the points about
 
01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
specifics with teachers and
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
representatives and supermarkets and on
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the current language of the statute
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
it says that there has to be a
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy for
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
this to be a charge so say if you were
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
at walmart shaw's on the sidewalk in a
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
classroom that wouldn't really apply
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
because i think that 30 high school
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
students or a few walmart customers
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really have a reasonable
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy that's not a very
 
01:10:32.239 --> 01:10:33.350 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy that's not a very
private

01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
private
 
01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.550 align:start position:0%
private
environment

01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
would this bill help because i've seen
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
some students
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
get disciplined because there is a no
 
01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.790 align:start position:0%
get disciplined because there is a no
videotape

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
videotape
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
tape and policy in most schools
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
so would this bill help
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
because i've seen
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
when a student gets bullied
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
somebody else videotapes it and then it
 
01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
goes up online
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
well if it makes national news
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's okay with it if it doesn't
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
make national news
 
01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
make national news
then

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
the person being bullied is is going to
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
be in trouble
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
would this bill help that to stop
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know some of the bullying going on
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
in school because then it's legal to
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
videotape this or
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
maybe it wouldn't because it's not an
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
employee of
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm under the impression that
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
recording policies within their own
 
01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
district will be controlled by the
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
district but
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
um on like in the matter of the actual
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
law uh there wouldn't be a reasonable
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy there and if
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
there was if there was only a few
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
students there then i don't think that
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
the student should be charged with
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
wiretapping or
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
disciplined by their school if they're
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
recording a bullying incident but that's
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
a case-by-case scenario all right thank
 
01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.390 align:start position:0%
a case-by-case scenario all right thank
you

01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
there'd be no further questions i
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank you very
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else wishing to testify
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
the committee calls ian freeman thank
 
01:12:25.199 --> 01:12:26.070 align:start position:0%
the committee calls ian freeman thank
you

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
i am ian freeman i am a talk show host
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh host to talk program that's on 190
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
radio stations around the country so
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech freedom of the press
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
pretty important to me
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire has for a very long
 
01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.270 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire has for a very long
time

01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
been one of the worst states
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the wiretapping laws
 
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.630 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the wiretapping laws
here

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
i believe it's one of the three worst in
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
fact as far as people in new hampshire
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
generally do not have the freedom
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
to record a conversation to which they
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
are a party
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
without giving notice to all of the
 
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.070 align:start position:0%
without giving notice to all of the
people

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:13:02.310 --> 01:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
who are involved
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
and this bill is not going to change
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
that per se but it does
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
do something very important and it does
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
allow people
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
to record conversations with so-called
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
public officials
 
01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
public officials
um

01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
my one concern with this bill and i
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a great bill is
 
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
as i read it it says a person to record
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
a public official in a public in public
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
while the public officials in the
 
01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
process of performing his or her duties
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
having seen some of the prosecutions
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
that people have been brought up on
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
under this statute
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
i know that the courts the police
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
they tend to interpret this as strictly
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
as possible and in the favor of the
 
01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.830 align:start position:0%
as possible and in the favor of the
state

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
so when i see the word in public
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
it makes me think about a friend of mine
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
who called up a school official in the
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
city of manchester
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
and recorded the conversation
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
is a phone call with someone who's
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
probably sitting in their private office
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
private office right because you can't
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
just walk in
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
like you can walk into this room
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're a public official they're doing
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
their public duties but are they in
 
01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.510 align:start position:0%
their public duties but are they in
public

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
when they're on a phone call with you
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
well this guy was charged with felony
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
wiretapping as a result of simply
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
recording a phone call where he had a
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
few questions for this public official
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
in the school system of manchester and
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
he was found guilty
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
of doing that now ultimately the state
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
actually ended up mischarging him they
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
should have charged him with a wireta or
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
sorry with a misdemeanor because he was
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
a party to that call and so
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's like a distinction between
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and felony anyway he got
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
charged for what should have been in my
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
opinion an on the record call so i my
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
concern with this bill is that it
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say in public it should simply
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
be anyone who is a public official
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
should be subject to being recorded
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
at any time when they're doing their
 
01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:03.350 align:start position:0%
at any time when they're doing their
duties

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
duties
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
so that's my one concern with this
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
having listened to some of the questions
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
up here
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think there should be a notice
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
requirement in general to
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
record anyone
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
and if you think about it
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
certain people who are
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
let's say less than honest or not
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
trustworthy as some of the government
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
workers can be
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
will change their behavior
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
based on whether or not they know
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
they're being recorded
 
01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.310 align:start position:0%
they're being recorded
so

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
if you are you know wearing a hidden
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
camera or hidden audio recording device
 
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
you can go in and go into a car shop
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
that you know has been accused of doing
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
dastardly things they're doing
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
repairs that aren't called for or
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing something that's untoward
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
and you can record them without their
 
01:15:52.159 --> 01:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
and you can record them without their
knowledge

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
and see what they do
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
maybe they're going to do something
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
wrong maybe they're going to be
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
dishonest whereas if you walk in with
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
the video camera openly
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
they know you're recording they're going
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
to change their behavior and so it's
 
01:16:08.709 --> 01:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
important to be able to record people
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
without their knowledge
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
which is it again this bill doesn't
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
address that but i'm explaining one of
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
the big differences between new
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire and almost every other state
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
in every other state as long as one
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
person knows there's a recording
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
so if i'm the undercover recorder i'm
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
the person who knows there's recording
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's legal in new hampshire that's a
 
01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
it's legal in new hampshire that's a
crime

01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
crime
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
and so that means that we cannot hold
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
public officials
 
01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
public officials
accountable

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
this changes that at the very least for
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
public officials it still allows other
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
private people to to not be held
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
accountable so again the statute still
 
01:16:41.199 --> 01:16:41.910 align:start position:0%
accountable so again the statute still
has

01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
serious problems even with this change
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
but i do support this change because uh
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
if you've read the new hampshire
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
constitution you know that the bill of
 
01:16:50.719 --> 01:16:51.910 align:start position:0%
constitution you know that the bill of
rights

01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
article 8 does specify that government
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
here is supposed to be open and
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
accountable if you cannot record
 
01:16:59.270 --> 01:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
a public official without their
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge in the process of their duties
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
if they're on the up and up and they're
 
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing they should have
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
nothing to be afraid of so i support
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i really appreciate your time happy
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recognize myself for a
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
question what are your thoughts on the
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
on the school part of it we heard
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions about regarding you know
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors and things of this
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
nature while they're talking to students
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
and in the classrooms where
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
minors might be picked up on the
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
recordings etc
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i fully support the right of
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
students to be able to record any
 
01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.189 align:start position:0%
students to be able to record any
interactions

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
interactions
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
with any of the public officials at the
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
schools these people are are paid by the
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
state and they should have no special
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
rights no more than anyone else so if
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
and it's certainly true that there are
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
some teachers that are doing abusive
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
things in their classrooms uh that
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
they're you know doing things that they
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be doing and i think that this
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
could hold them accountable for that i
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
guess the the crux of my question was is
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to um
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
with regard to other students in the
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
classroom being recorded
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
um who aren't public officials in the
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
process of recording the public official
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
in a classroom what are your thoughts on
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
that run that by me one more time so if
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm a student and i want to
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
record my math teacher because he's
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
doing whatever yeah i'm also going to be
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
recording my classmates who are not
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
public officials and who are minors and
 
01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
who have not signed a release to allow
 
01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
themselves to be recorded what are your
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that this is the right i see
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
what you're saying here um
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion if you were in a public
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
place you're subject to being recorded
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
if i go down to
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
the park and i want to record what's
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
going on in the park it's my right to do
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
that personally i wouldn't because i
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
think that's boring and it's not you
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
know something i'm interested in but if
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
you're in public you don't have a right
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
to privacy and if you're in a public
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
school classroom you don't have a right
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
to privacy so
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
if that's a concern for some kids they
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be going to government school
 
01:19:01.669 --> 01:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
and they should find a private school or
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
go and be homeschooled where they'll
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh with the school's situation
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
i have
some

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
friends that are parents of high school
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
kids and they're always complaining
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
about the tick tocks that they're
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
constantly recording in schools
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
and if i understand right they're
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
picking up
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
kids in the background
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
in a public setting like that
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
you don't need consent do you from
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know all the people around you
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
the statute as i'm familiar with it and
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
it is you know a lengthy statute
 
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.270 align:start position:0%
it is you know a lengthy statute
is

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
nebulous in general about what consent
 
01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:51.590 align:start position:0%
nebulous in general about what consent
is

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm of the belief that if you're in a
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
public place and you're obviously
 
01:19:55.199 --> 01:19:56.390 align:start position:0%
public place and you're obviously
recording

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
recording
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
if you continue to speak to me you're
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
consenting however i don't know if the
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
courts would interpret it that way
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's just my belief as somebody who
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
believes in in freedom of speech like if
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
i if we're having a conversation in a
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
park and i pull a camera out you should
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
presume i'm going i'm i am recording you
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
and if you keep talking you should
 
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.470 align:start position:0%
and if you keep talking you should
presume

01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
presume
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be recorded so in
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
my mind you're continuing to have that
 
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.350 align:start position:0%
my mind you're continuing to have that
conversation

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
is is your consent to being recorded but
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that's ever really been
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
addressed in the courts and given the
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
the way the statute is written about all
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
parties must consent
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's not all parties who need to be
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
noticed if i recall i don't have it in
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
front of me at the moment
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
but the way it's written is not very
 
01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
good and new hampshire is one of the
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
least free states when it comes to this
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.629 --> 01:20:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you for
 
01:20:52.229 --> 01:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
so if this law or this bill became law
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
there would be no privileged uh
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
space for public officials and that is
 
01:21:03.679 --> 01:21:04.790 align:start position:0%
space for public officials and that is
including

01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
courts of law including
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
grand juries where
 
01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.550 align:start position:0%
grand juries where
we

01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
keep witnesses separated their testimony
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
separate from each other until they have
 
01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.910 align:start position:0%
separate from each other until they have
testified

01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
testified
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
and a recording of their testimony
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
could be exposed to
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
witnesses in the future
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
to reflect to uh
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
have influence on their testimony uh
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
is that a concern
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
are you saying that grand juries are
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
public officials meaning that it's open
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
to the public because my understanding
 
01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
you cannot go into a grand jury i cannot
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
just walk in as a member of the media to
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
record a grand jury um
 
01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.629 align:start position:0%
record a grand jury um
hearing

01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
i'm uncertain whether it's a public
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
space but it's i'm telling you it's not
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you to
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
the witness for taking the question new
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a state that values its
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
freedom undoubtedly
 
01:22:09.350 --> 01:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
we are also a state that
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
gives individual that values individual
 
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.189 align:start position:0%
gives individual that values individual
privacy

01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
the way this is written
 
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know what percentage but vast
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
swaths of our state i you could say half
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
of our residents would qualify under
 
01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:23.430 align:start position:0%
of our residents would qualify under
this

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
as a public
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
person who could be recorded in their
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm wondering does that concern
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
you does that
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
do we have do we
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
cede our right to
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
limited privacy by virtue of running for
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
a water board seat or getting a paycheck
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
from the government
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
i think you're overestimating the
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
numbers of people that are considered
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
public officials this only addresses
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
public officials those are people who
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
are being paid who have sworn some sort
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
of an oath
 
01:22:57.679 --> 01:22:58.390 align:start position:0%
of an oath
to

01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:58.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
perform a duty for the state i don't
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
think half of the people of new
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire qualify for that it's probably
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
less than a tenth
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
would be my guess but to answer your
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
further question yes
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
if you are a public official if you have
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
any kind of job where you're working for
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
the state you should be open and
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
accountable and that means that you
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
should be able to be recorded in the
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
process of your duties
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's part of the deal when you take
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
this position
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
as people get to record you doing what
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
you do
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
it's not part of the current deal but
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you that is the way it should be
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative spelling i'm sorry just
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
may i go on a little bit
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
you can be recorded right here right now
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
without your consent you can be recorded
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
walking through the hallways without
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
your consent it's just the question is
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
should you be able to be recorded
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
without knowing
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i think you should
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative colleen
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question from
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
your perspective where does the
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy come
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
in because a lot of the discussion i'm
 
01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.910 align:start position:0%
in because a lot of the discussion i'm
hearing

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
they're talking about
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
recording people in essentially public
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
places which there is no reasonable
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy and i would
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
imagine that under current law they
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't be charged anyway for example
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
when videos are done of the protests in
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
front of the state house they don't get
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
a waiver from every single person
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
attending the protest that's right
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
because there's no reasonable
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy attending a
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
protest in the front of the state house
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
for the same token what you just said
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
about walking down the hallway here
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
there's no reasonable expectation of
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
privacy anywhere walking down a public
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
room there would be a reasonable
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy in one of the
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
side offices having a discussion with
 
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
somebody one-on-one
 
01:24:48.390 --> 01:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
but not
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
in a hallway or in this room
 
01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:52.719 align:start position:0%
so where exactly
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
is the reasonable expectation of privacy
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
and this law or this bill that could
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
become a law
 
01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
become a law
um

01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
intersecting can we kind of separate out
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
what this is actually doing compared to
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
what some of these other questions are
 
01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.830 align:start position:0%
what some of these other questions are
that

01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
really don't apply because it's already
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
got no reasonable expectation of privacy
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
i see what you're saying i think this
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill would allow those conversations
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about whether it be
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
with a dcyf official police officer or
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
whoever it is that's having that
 
01:25:20.719 --> 01:25:22.070 align:start position:0%
whoever it is that's having that
conversation

01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
in a quote-unquote private room there's
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
still a public official doing their
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
public duties and that's why my concern
 
01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
is that there is this line of in public
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
in this this bill which i think should
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
be struck
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
because the courts are always
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
interpreting this as strictly as
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
possible and if you're a public duty i
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
don't care if you're in your office or
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
if you're on a phone call
 
01:25:46.149 --> 01:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
you are getting paid by the state and
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
you should be held accountable for that
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
so this would increase the ability to
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
record government people wherever they
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
happen to be
 
01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
happen to be
follow-up

01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
i agree with you about the public
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
statement because when i read that that
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
might become a problem if
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
parents allow dcyf into their home and
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
they record the interaction their home
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
is obviously not public that's right
 
01:26:12.719 --> 01:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
is obviously not public that's right
so

01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
think that this bill would be
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient enough
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
as is with the removal of the word
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
public i think it's an excellent
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
improvement if you were to i think it's
 
01:26:28.229 --> 01:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
fine as is but it would be even better
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
removing that word uh in public those
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
two words from this bill
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
i think it would be absolutely fantastic
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
for accountability of government
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
you can't see the dean of the house she
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
has her hand up i'll defer to the dean
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the house and then ask my question
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
i i seem to
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
think thank you for taking my question
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
but i seem to
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
think that listening to you
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
that you are saying
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
that when you
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
take a job or run for an office in the
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.629 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
you

01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
lose your freedom of speech
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
no ma'am that's not what i'm saying at
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
all i'm saying you lose any kind of
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
ability to have or you should
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
you should lose your ability to be
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
private as a public official meaning
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
that you should be free to say whatever
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
you want
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
i should be free to record you saying
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
whatever you want as a public official
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.350 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
sure

01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
just listen to the testimony there's a
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion about definitions
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of community confusion
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
about exemptions there was testimony
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
earlier that listed a list of exemptions
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
and and that's just the way that these
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
laws are written and presented when
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're heard in the public hearing
 
01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.629 align:start position:0%
they're heard in the public hearing
so

01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
i'm having a lot of trouble with
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
definitions of public definitions of
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
public official i mean you have one we
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
all have different ones sure and i
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
suspect that there are definitions in
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
other parts of the law
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
so just for my question
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
we assume as the bill is written that
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
says in public space public places
 
01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.390 align:start position:0%
says in public space public places
um

01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
do you think that in in this building
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
there are spaces that other than the
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
men's and ladies rooms
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
that are private spaces where the public
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
does not have access to those spaces and
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
and does should not expect
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
the ability to record things in those
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
spaces in a public building
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
that are did you just agree with that
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
concept either or other or not you may
 
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
say there are none of them yeah i don't
 
01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
think this bill pretends to actually
 
01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:57.270 align:start position:0%
think this bill pretends to actually
give

01:28:57.270 --> 01:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
give
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
people access to locked off areas or
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
something like that so
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
i as a member of the media can't all of
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
a sudden go into your whatever private
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
area you might have with other state
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
reps i don't even know probably exists
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
but if i did know it existed if the door
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
is locked and it's authorized only or
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
something like that so this doesn't open
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
up uh closed public or closed spaces as
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
i understand it and forgive me the
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
definition of public spaces and private
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
spaces and public buildings is probably
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
defined somewhere in the law and maybe i
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
hope we get to look that up when we
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
before we execute but
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
so my other question is
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
like the school we talked about schools
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the public cannot just walk into a
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
school and walk down the corridor and
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
walk into a classroom when the school is
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
in session that's right so i i wonder if
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
if you would find that to be
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
a public space
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
as as it is in this bill or or when you
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
think we should be recorded probably
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere but that's okay
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
do you think there are spaces like that
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
that the public work areas uh there are
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of places that the public cannot
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
just walk into so i i don't know if you
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
agree with that definition or not
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
yeah i see where you're coming from and
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
again i don't think this bill addresses
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
what is and what is not a public space i
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't think it opens any previously
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
restricted spaces there obviously
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
places that are government places
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
whether it be a jail or a school or
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
whatever where you have to pass some
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
rigorous examination in order to get
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
into that place
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
if you are into that place if you have
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
been authorized to go into that place
 
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
i think that you should be able to
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
record anything that goes on in that in
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
that facility whether you be a student a
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
visiting teacher or whoever you happen
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
very much for that question for that
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
answer i have what i hope is a simple
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
question if i'm sitting at a at a
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
restaurant with my child
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
and they ask me dad what's going on in
 
01:30:56.709 --> 01:30:56.719 align:start position:0%
the state house and i sit and have a
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
conversation between me and my child to
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
educate them on what's going on should i
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
be able to be recorded by doing that by
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
your child you mean
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
by anybody should somebody be able to
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
walk up and stick a
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
camera in my face while i'm just having
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
a dinner conversation with my child
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
is that because i'm a public official i
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
give up that right to have a free
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
conversation with my child you're in a
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
private business at that point and i
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
think that the business owner would be
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
the one who gets to decide whether or
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
not people get to record in their
 
01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
property as a member of the media i
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
am uncomfortable i generally
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
decline recording when i'm in private
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
businesses unless there's something
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely outrageous that like if
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
somebody gets attacked right like then
 
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'm gonna pull out a camera and
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
record that uh but uh just you know the
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
normal pro procedure of business i'm not
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
interested in recording that without the
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
permission of the the business owner
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
typically because i do respect the idea
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
of private places so i guess that would
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
come down to the question of is a
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
private business considered a public
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
space i would say it isn't even though
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
you could argue that it's open to the
 
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.510 align:start position:0%
you could argue that it's open to the
public

01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
and again that would come down to where
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
if anywhere is this defined
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of a public space is a private
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
business considered a public space under
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
the law i'm not sure
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
i don't consider it to be a public space
 
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.510 align:start position:0%
i don't consider it to be a public space
personally

01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for

taking a really really firm stance
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%

01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%

01:32:58.629 --> 01:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
regular citizens are untrustworthy we
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%

child pornography it's a problem it's a
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
big problem so i know in most schools
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%

that's what i'm saying
and

01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%

hb 1571 relative to increasing fines for
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
littering and direct revenues
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
directing revenues to the fish and game
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
department is a bill that's important to
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
protecting our environment supporting
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%

under-resourced fish and game department
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree that enforcing
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
fines has a value
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
an increase in fines means we're taking
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
matters very seriously
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
the threat of fines helps visitors want
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
to keep the roads and parks pristine
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%

01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
attractions clean
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
it safeguards our tourism economy
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%

01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%

01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
how does the harsh
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%

01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
game is very
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
tight on how many personnel they
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
currently have in the field
 
01:38:38.639 --> 01:38:39.990 align:start position:0%
currently have in the field
and

01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
we need to find a way to fund that this
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
is not the only way but it's one way
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative boardney
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is worded it says it
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
will increase the fine for violations of
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
this section by 20 percent
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
most times when we look at fines they're
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
expressed as monetary amounts rather
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
than an increase
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
is that a problem
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
it just so happens that i also sit on
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
transportation and public works and
 
01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.790 align:start position:0%
transportation and public works and
highways

01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
highways
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
and yesterday we had a bill
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
which proposes to increase the fines for
 
01:39:32.709 --> 01:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
littering dramatically over what they
 
01:39:32.719 --> 01:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
littering dramatically over what they
were

01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
i think a first offense a violation was
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
64.50 initially and the new bill would
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
raise that to 300 dollars for first
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
offense and 500 dollars for second
 
01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.910 align:start position:0%
offense and 500 dollars for second
offense

01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
so it would add 20 percent to those
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
which would create
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of money for fish
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
and game
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
um also for the state
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
wherever that money goes i don't know if
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
it goes to the judiciary or if it goes
 
01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.950 align:start position:0%
it goes to the judiciary or if it goes
to

01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
to public works and highways but uh 20
 
01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
percent of it would be diverted through
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
a fund
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
under rsa 206
 
01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.510 align:start position:0%
under rsa 206
35

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
and that really is what i can tell you
 
01:40:20.470 --> 01:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
that bill is still in committee
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i can't tell you whether it'll pass
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
or not but
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
currently i can tell you that first
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
offense is 64
 
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
50 the second offense is 129 dollars i
 
01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:34.149 align:start position:0%
50 the second offense is 129 dollars i
believe

01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:34.159 --> 01:40:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
if i might add something else
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
i'm from coast district one
 
01:40:39.679 --> 01:40:40.470 align:start position:0%
i'm from coast district one
and

01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem we have with
 
01:40:44.470 --> 01:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
littering in coast district one is in
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
our trail systems
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
and the reason it's such an intense
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
problem is because the people who own
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
those lands
 
01:40:53.109 --> 01:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
and allow the
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
the people to recreate on them um well i
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
had one stop at my office one couple
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
they had walked one day
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
when the ohrvs were on there and they
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
came out with two five gallon bottles
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
buckets of beer bottles
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know how
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
we can stop all that but if we can make
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
the fines
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
so relevant to people's
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
personal economy that i think that's
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
going to help
 
01:41:24.239 --> 01:41:25.030 align:start position:0%
going to help
so

01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
if we were to make this a uh follow-up
 
01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.270 align:start position:0%
if we were to make this a uh follow-up
yes

01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
if we were to make this a monetary fine
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
what would the fine you suggest
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
well it's twenty percent of whatever the
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
fine sorry i am in law at twenty percent
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that means anything to
 
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
me um well in a 500 fine it would be
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
is that what you said 600
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
plus penalty assessment
 
01:41:58.390 --> 01:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
there be no further questions thank you
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you very much
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls richard head
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
morning mr chairman my name is richard
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
head i'm the government affairs
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch we
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
have no position on the policy of this
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
bill there were two things i wanted to
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
briefly discuss
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
one is something it's also in your in
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
the electronic filing of the of
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
testimony relates to the effective date
 
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'm doing this this
 
01:43:03.510 --> 01:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
session is
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
sort of going to every bill that has an
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
issue relative to the effective date of
 
01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:09.109 align:start position:0%
issue relative to the effective date of
bills

01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
um because it's important to the
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
judicial branch so i did want to take
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
just a minute to briefly explain why it
 
01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.550 align:start position:0%
just a minute to briefly explain why it
is

01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
um that we are doing this and what the
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
what the concern is and and what i've
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
handed out is the is the letter of
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and then on the back side of
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
that is is the proposed amendment on the
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
and and this relates to a statute which
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
is rsa 14 colon 9a which talks about um
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is a statute that actually defines
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
when an effective date of a bill should
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
should apply or what it should be
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
and what it says is that
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
each law that affects judicial practice
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
and procedure or establishes or
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
eliminates criminal prohibitions civil
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
causes of actions or remedies or
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
limitations of actions shall take effect
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
on january 1 of the following year
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is and i can use
 
01:44:02.950 --> 01:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
this bill as an example
 
01:44:03.990 --> 01:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
in in several different
 
01:44:08.550 --> 01:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
sections of the statutes
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
would have a
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
modification to the fine schedules and
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
would require the judicial branch to
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
distribute those monies differently than
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
we currently do
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that when a clerk
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
is receiving money at a courthouse
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
that money has to be inputted into our
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
system in a particular way
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
so that this specific line of statute
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
is also has a core
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
corresponding line in our odyssey
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
database and that the odyssey database
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
has a code that tells our financial
 
01:44:42.239 --> 01:44:43.189 align:start position:0%
has a code that tells our financial
people

01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
20 of this fine has to go to in a
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
particular location that takes time so
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
this bill impacts three different
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
statutory provisions those three
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
provisions have to be updated
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
and there are statutes or bills after
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
bills after bills that do the exact same
 
01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.790 align:start position:0%
bills after bills that do the exact same
thing

01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
they change uh felony provisions they
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
exchange civil provisions and it just
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
takes us time to get all those lined up
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
so that's the the reason behind this
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
statue it's a long explanation but i
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
like to explain it to big committees
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
because all of you are also proposing
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
bills and i do ask if you were proposing
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
a bill that that does any of these
 
01:45:22.310 --> 01:45:22.320 align:start position:0%
things if you could make it january 1
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
you won't have to hear from me so often
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
so i try to give you an incentive to do
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
that also
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
um so i do ask and and i've proposed the
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
amendment on the back side of what i
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
handed out today simply changing if this
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill were to go forward simply change
 
01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
the effective date to january 1 of
 
01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:41.109 align:start position:0%
the effective date to january 1 of
2023.

01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
2023.
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
um and then i would also be happy to
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions i did do at least
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch's fiscal note um on
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
this i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
questions if you had any regarding the
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note uh would that be
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
that's all i had
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative conley thank you mr
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you mr head for taking
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
the question can you clarify where
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
fish and game or where littering fines
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
currently go
 
01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:06.790 align:start position:0%
currently go
uh

01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
in our state sure thank you so and what
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
i have are the three
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
statutory sections that are specifically
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
referenced in this bill
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
so rsa 265 colon 102
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
that goes to the highway fund
 
01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:24.830 align:start position:0%
that goes to the highway fund
rsa

01:46:24.830 --> 01:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
163b is goes to the general fund
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
and rsa 163 b3s both are the one 163bs
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
those are both general fund
 
01:46:35.679 --> 01:46:37.669 align:start position:0%
those are both general fund
distributions

01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
distributions
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
and what this would do
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
under the new bill or under the proposed
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill would be
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
an additional amount
 
01:46:47.189 --> 01:46:47.199 align:start position:0%
that would go to
 
01:46:47.199 --> 01:46:47.910 align:start position:0%
that would go to
the

01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
new fund that's created through the bill
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money would be
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
distributed to the highway fund or the
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
general fund because it's only the
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
additional 20 percent that gets
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
sent to the new fund at least that's how
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
we read the statute or the bill
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
in addition there is on all fines a
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment and that penalty
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
assessment is distributed separately
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
through a different statutory provision
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the the split on penalty assessment
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
funds are general fund uh victim
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
assistance fund and the judicial
 
01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:21.910 align:start position:0%
assistance fund and the judicial
branches branch's

01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
branches branch's
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
it fund
 
01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
is is the breakup and the percentages on
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
those and i
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
i don't have the exact percentages of
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
those uh the penalty assessment
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
distributions but those are the three
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative splain
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr head for
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question um over here
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
it's hard to hear but i got these things
 
01:47:48.629 --> 01:47:48.639 align:start position:0%
and i got to find yeah i understand um
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
can you tell me if uh dumping on private
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
or public land and or industrial dumping
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
falls under the same category as
 
01:47:58.239 --> 01:47:59.270 align:start position:0%
falls under the same category as
littering

01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
littering
 
01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me that
 
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
a better
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
direction for
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
money for fishing game would be those
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
high impact areas of
 
01:48:12.070 --> 01:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
illegally dumping
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
large quantities of materials on those
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
back dirt roads and and field trails and
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
such that actually impact those of us
 
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
who go out hunting
 
01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:21.669 align:start position:0%
who go out hunting
and

01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
i think are more easily tracked down to
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
the owner who dumped in a lot of cases
 
01:48:27.109 --> 01:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
because there's some identifiable
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
information that's been dumped there
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
rather than littering on the side of the
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
road where previously we heard about the
 
01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
person who brought in two things full of
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
beer bottles
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
unless you catch them in the act you
 
01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
can't get that money so i'm wondering if
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's considered still littering or if
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's a different statute that that
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
deals with illegal dumping on purse
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
private land public land and then
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
businesses who do so
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
um short answer is i don't know um a
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
slightly longer answer is not based on
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
my experience in the judicial branch my
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
experience in private practice
 
01:49:02.709 --> 01:49:02.719 align:start position:0%
i think you might also implicate some of
 
01:49:02.719 --> 01:49:03.590 align:start position:0%
i think you might also implicate some of
the

01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
solid waste or hazardous waste statutes
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
in the department of environmental
 
01:49:07.119 --> 01:49:08.229 align:start position:0%
in the department of environmental
services

01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
depending on what the material is
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
and the quantity but you may have some
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
environmental statutes that deal with
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
solid waste
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
or hazardous materials that that would
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
apply in in a larger dumping situation
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
you also have some that relate to tires
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
and other things
 
01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:26.830 align:start position:0%
and other things
thank

01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:28.709 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you sir for
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
just look around you you'll find you'll
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
find the voice sooner or later i gotta
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
look for the little red light um
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
let's see where was i going uh
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
i don't recall you
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
here last year
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
maybe you were and i wasn't paying
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
attention is this a new find that your
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
the dates is that is that a new push for
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
your office
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes and no so i started about
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
in about a year ago uh howie zibble had
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
the position before before me
 
01:50:09.589 --> 01:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what how he was doing
 
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately last year when i started i
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
was doing everything remotely
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
because at the time those hearings were
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
all being remote
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
i did try to do it as much as i could
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
last session this session i'm probably a
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
little bit more active in in the effort
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
only because
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
um you know we do see it a lot it does
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
have actually a substantial impact on
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are who are trying
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
to do all this we see it especially in
 
01:50:38.159 --> 01:50:39.189 align:start position:0%
to do all this we see it especially in
the

01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty sections
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
which has a whole
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
whole area of of
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
recording requirements so for example
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
any modification to a criminal statute
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
you're implicating the j-1 system the
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
uniform charge table which the
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety and the department
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
of justice have to line up so that when
 
01:51:01.199 --> 01:51:02.310 align:start position:0%
of justice have to line up so that when
a

01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer
 
01:51:06.470 --> 01:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
is filing a charge that charge
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
corresponds to the current version of
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
the statutory provision and then
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
corresponds to the proper penalties and
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
any time you make a tweak in a statute
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
j1 has to get changed the uniform charge
 
01:51:21.189 --> 01:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
table has to be changed and then within
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
the department or within the judicial
 
01:51:23.119 --> 01:51:24.070 align:start position:0%
the department or within the judicial
branch

01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
branch
 
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
our odyssey
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
database has to be changed so when that
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
is received
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
our databases identify it with the
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
current language of the statute as as
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's been modified in the legislative
 
01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:37.830 align:start position:0%
it's been modified in the legislative
session

01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:51:40.149 --> 01:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
and the appropriate penalty whether it
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
be a violation misdemeanor or a felony
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
and because there are so many even the
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
slightest modifications that occur all
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
of our all of those lines have to be
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
accurately reflected in both the
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
what law enforcement sees under the
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
uniform charge table and then what the
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
judicial branch sees in our odyssey
 
01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
database to ensure
 
01:52:01.360 --> 01:52:02.470 align:start position:0%
database to ensure
that

01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
there are no errors at the time a
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
i was pre-med not pre-law but i i
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
understand why you need that extra time
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
in the past if you didn't have that
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
extra time
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
what happened say if this bill went
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
through and nobody caught
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
that is effective in 60 days
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
what would happen
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know based on personal
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
experience i don't know if mistakes were
 
01:52:41.830 --> 01:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
being made and documents had to be
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
modified once something got filed or if
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
money was being sent to the wrong
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
location for a period of time i don't
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that but it certainly
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
increases the likelihood of errors being
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
made if those systems aren't up to date
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for the
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman would you have any
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
idea mr head of how much money we take
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
in per year
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
there are two areas in which the money
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
can come in so i only have the judicial
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
branches some of it is paid directly to
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
01:53:21.199 --> 01:53:22.070 align:start position:0%
the agency
um

01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
in so we we took um
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
2020 data
 
01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.990 align:start position:0%
2020 data
um

01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
and in 2020
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
actually we took essentially from from
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
november 1 2020 through
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
october 31 2021 so when i put the note
 
01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:39.189 align:start position:0%
october 31 2021 so when i put the note
together

01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
the total
 
01:53:43.990 --> 01:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
collected under the three funds was
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
a little over nine thousand dollars
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
so the additional twenty percent if you
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
just take that would be about an
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
additional eighteen hundred dollars
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
based on what we collected
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
and then i think the
 
01:53:59.119 --> 01:54:04.229 align:start position:0%
and then i think the
um

01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
at least the fiscal note that combines
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
both our fiscal note in the department
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
of safety's
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
suggests that the total additional
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
revenue would be less than five thousand
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you is
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
there anyone else wishing to testify who
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't signed up on this bill
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will hereby close the
 
01:54:30.149 --> 01:54:30.159 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
on hp
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
1571 fn
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the committee will stand in recess
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.159 --> 01:55:29.589 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.880 --> 01:56:00.550 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.119 --> 01:56:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:54.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.239 --> 01:57:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:06.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.239 --> 01:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:47.520 --> 01:59:29.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:59:29.669 --> 01:59:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.800 --> 02:00:08.149 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.840 --> 02:17:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
up

02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
it being 11 15
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
we will now be opening the public
 
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
1108 relative to the prescribed mana for
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
honorable members for welcoming me to
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
your committee uh for the record my name
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
is ellen reed i represent rockingham 17.
 
02:17:58.469 --> 02:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
new market and new fields
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
this short bill before you all it does
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
is provide an alternative method
 
02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:06.319 align:start position:0%
of posting one's land for property
 
02:18:06.319 --> 02:18:08.150 align:start position:0%
of posting one's land for property
owners

02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
owners
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
it does not provide an incentive or
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
decentralized posting it just provides
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
an alternative method it doesn't remove
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
the current method
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
now why would we need this well the
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
current law prescribes the method of
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
posting as putting a sign with lettering
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's a certain number of inches tall
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
two inches tall
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
says that the
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
landowner's personal information contact
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
information must be on the sign it has
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
to be every hundred yards but there's a
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
few problems with this method of posting
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
and this is something that many other
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
states which i'll get into in a moment
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
have identified
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
mainly that signs are not
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
rugged when it comes to weather when it
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
comes to animals when it comes to even
 
02:18:54.549 --> 02:18:54.559 align:start position:0%
people possibly tampering with signs
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
signs typically only last a couple years
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
also they tend to be more expensive
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
and more difficult to put up on trees
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
and they damage because the nail holes
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
damage valuable butt logs which are the
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
most valuable logs when you're lumbering
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
damage that lumber
 
02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:13.270 align:start position:0%
damage that lumber
so

02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
the easier cheaper faster method
 
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
especially if the landowner happens to
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
be elderly or disabled and has a problem
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
getting up and hammering signs into
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
trees the easier method is simply to
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
spray a vertical line of paint this is
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
something that some 20 other states have
 
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
already done a handful of states have
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
current open legislation on
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so that is what this bill does it
 
02:19:36.070 --> 02:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
mimics the language that is pretty much
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
and just so you know the states that
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
have adopted this are typically big
 
02:19:46.709 --> 02:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
landowner rights states like texas
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
louisiana kansas idaho florida
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania tennessee montana passed
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
this in 1973
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
and arkansas has been doing this since
 
02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:57.030 align:start position:0%
and arkansas has been doing this since
1989

02:19:57.030 --> 02:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
1989
 
02:20:00.270 --> 02:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a well understood uh
 
02:20:03.750 --> 02:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
non-problematic way of posting land
 
02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:04.550 align:start position:0%
non-problematic way of posting land
so

02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
there are a a few
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns that i've heard
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
when discussing this bill with um
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
interested parties in general most
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
landowners seem very favorable but
 
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
favorable to this
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
but i want to address
 
02:20:19.359 --> 02:20:20.150 align:start position:0%
but i want to address
the

02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
questions that i've heard so the first
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
question is could does this have the
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
potential to cause confusion in terms of
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that there's trail markings out
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
there that might look like this there
 
02:20:32.309 --> 02:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
are no standardized systems of trail
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
markings that involve vertical paint
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
stripes purple paint stripes um
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
usually and you may know this from
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
hiking in our state parks
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
trail markers usually
 
02:20:46.870 --> 02:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
involve specific shapes and specific
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
colors not just a vertical paint stripe
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
also the question has been raised as to
 
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not this could impact people
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
who are colorblind and would they be
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
able to see the markings red green color
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
blindness means that if in the worst
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
example you would not be able to
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
distinguish purple from blue certainly
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
if you are colorblind you know that
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
purple and blue look the same to you and
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
this would be obviously a painted mark
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
on a tree that looked like what you know
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
as purple
 
02:21:21.910 --> 02:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
or blue which are the same to you so
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
this is a very obvious it doesn't look
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
for a colorblind person a stripe of
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
purple does not look like the tree it
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like the bark it looks like
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
a paint of a painted stripe of blue
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
which is very obvious to that person in
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
addition i would argue that frequently
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
not always but frequently people who are
 
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
out there
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
and hunting is the most frequent example
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
of someone who might be out there
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
no trespassing signs
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
that frequently they're not alone so
 
02:21:53.110 --> 02:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
certainly they can confirm with someone
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
else that they are with but i digress
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
another argument i've heard or an idea
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
i've heard is well what happens when the
 
02:22:01.990 --> 02:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
property is sold and new landowner
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily want to post their
 
02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:05.349 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily want to post their
land

02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
land
 
02:22:07.830 --> 02:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
much like currently if that is the case
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
the new landowner would have to remove
 
02:22:11.590 --> 02:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
the current signage that exists which
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
means getting up pulling nails out of
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
trees that now have been damaged that
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
now they own might have wanted to sell
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
for lumber but those but logs have been
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
damaged by those nails that's labor
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
intensive whereas covering up the purple
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
stripe with brown paint is a much easier
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
cheaper faster way to remove those
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
no trespassing markings
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
than pulling down those signs and also
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
in either case that can be made a
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
condition of sale they can ask that the
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
current owner
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
remove those signs by paint
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
painting over them before they take over
 
02:22:46.880 --> 02:22:50.950 align:start position:0%
painting over them before they take over
ownership

02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the personally identifiable information
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i i want to uh point out
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
something that the lawyer did that i
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
actually didn't request but i know why
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
he did it
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
um in the in paragraph one it has
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
changed the writing of the name and
 
02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
address of the owner or lisi
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
um is optional
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
now the reason that i know he how he did
 
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
this is because we've had a number of
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
court cases where people who have
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
trespassed on land
 
02:23:22.710 --> 02:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
argued that the signage did not include
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
information of the landowner and
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
therefore was invalid and they had a
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
right to be on that land and in every
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
case the judge has ruled it is the
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
intent of the landowner that matters not
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not they obeyed the actual
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
letter of the law so in court law
 
02:23:39.429 --> 02:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's basically
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
deactivated the section
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
that requires the personal identifiable
 
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
information certainly we can all imagine
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
most of us i would say probably don't
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
want to put our personal contact
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
information billboard style out
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
out in the open so that anybody could
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
see it
 
02:23:59.270 --> 02:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
so many landowners don't in fact i was
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
just walking property uh with someone
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
who i know is one of the best outdoors
 
02:24:04.479 --> 02:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
who i know is one of the best outdoors
people

02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
that i've ever met and we used the
 
02:24:11.429 --> 02:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
property note the posted yellow signs to
 
02:24:13.349 --> 02:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
find the boundary of the property that
 
02:24:15.830 --> 02:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
we were on and those posted yellow signs
 
02:24:18.150 --> 02:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
did not contain personal identifiable
 
02:24:20.469 --> 02:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
information or contact information of
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
the landowner
 
02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:22.790 align:start position:0%
the landowner
now

02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
another issue is well what if what if
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's out there and needs to
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
contact the landowner what if there's an
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
emergency or what if the the police need
 
02:24:33.750 --> 02:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
to contact the landowner in every single
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
one of those k well i would say almost
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
every single one of those cases the
 
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
easier way to find out that contact
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
information is to look online on the tax
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
map certainly for municipal police who
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
are probably very familiar with their
 
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
town's website
 
02:24:49.349 --> 02:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
the tax maps are
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
updated relatively soon after a sale
 
02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
whereas signs can stay up for a couple
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
of years after a sale and certainly the
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
new landowner may not
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
switch out those signs just because that
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
that information is no longer their
 
02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
contact information they'll say yeah
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's posted that's all i care about so
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
if you're out in the wilderness and i
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
remember walking with my friend uh it
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
took us a few minutes to find those
 
02:25:16.469 --> 02:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
signs to go the hundred yards look
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
through the woods and find those yellow
 
02:25:19.190 --> 02:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
signs so it might take you several
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
minutes especially if you're in the dark
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
to go find a sign hope that there is
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
personal contact information on that
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
sign whereas you can simply go straight
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
to the website and find out who owns
 
02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
also there has been
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
an argument about uh well what is to
 
02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:41.990 align:start position:0%
an argument about uh well what is to
prevent

02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:43.110 align:start position:0%
prevent
some

02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
rabid anti-hunting activists from going
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
around just painting trees
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
to which i say if there's a rabid
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
anti-hunting activist or any kind of
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
activist who wants land posted for
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
they would already be posting signs up
 
02:25:59.830 --> 02:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
that certainly if you're a rabid and
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
anti-hunting activist
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
a couple nails is not going to deter you
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
from putting up signs
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
when that's what you want to do i will
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
point out that it's illegal whether it's
 
02:26:11.750 --> 02:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
signage or pain it's it's illegal and i
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
will point to line 16
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
line 15 and 16 any person found removing
 
02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
defacing yada yada the property of
 
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
another it's not just prohibited it's
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
actually a criminal penalty class b
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but having said that they
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
would already be doing that do you know
 
02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
and this is rhetorical how many cases we
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
have of people actually like actual
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
recorded cases
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
of people posting signs on land that
 
02:26:38.550 --> 02:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
isn't theirs
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no recorded case
 
02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.070 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no recorded case
um

02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
however we do have cases of people
 
02:26:46.150 --> 02:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
tampering with landowner signs
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
um to try to cover up the fact that they
 
02:26:49.349 --> 02:26:49.359 align:start position:0%
were on that property when they weren't
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
and i guess that brings me to
 
02:26:56.630 --> 02:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
the main point which is in case law
 
02:26:58.950 --> 02:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
as well as i think just our reasonable
 
02:27:01.510 --> 02:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of what property owners
 
02:27:03.030 --> 02:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
rights should be
 
02:27:05.349 --> 02:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
we don't the situation we do not want is
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
people trespassing onto land that they
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
know that they are not welcome
 
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
land that has been bought and purchased
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
many times because people want privacy
 
02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
by people who don't want people on their
 
02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:20.150 align:start position:0%
by people who don't want people on their
land

02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
land
 
02:27:21.670 --> 02:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
and we don't want people trespassing on
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
that because of a technicality because
 
02:27:26.309 --> 02:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
oh this this sign didn't have the
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
correct information or this sign was not
 
02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
far enough away or it fell down in a
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
storm or a squirrel aided or what have
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
you what that's the situation we don't
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
want that actually leads to conflict
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
which is why we've had court cases on
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
this matter and why the judges have
 
02:27:41.990 --> 02:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
repeatedly ruled that it's the intent
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
the clear intent of the landowner that
 
02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:45.270 align:start position:0%
the clear intent of the landowner that
matters

02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
matters
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to answer
 
02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:50.070 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to answer
questions

02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question the the cases
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
you cited have those gone to the new
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court or those circuit
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
court cases
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
i don't believe any of them have gone to
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
the supreme court have been appealed to
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm
 
02:28:17.590 --> 02:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
some rabbit as you call them um anti uh
 
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
four wheeler uh because my father-in-law
 
02:28:27.750 --> 02:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
owns a camp or a house in colebrook
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of them up there that
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
want to stop all the four-wheelers noise
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
in snowmobile noise
 
02:28:37.510 --> 02:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
but luckily they haven't won yet
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully they won't but what would stop
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
them from just going over painting all
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
the trails
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
the purple i know it's against the law
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
but you know people break the laws every
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
day right and that's why i mean it's why
 
02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
we have laws right to prohibit not
 
02:28:52.230 --> 02:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
prohibit but discourage certain
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
activities and and we do have a criminal
 
02:28:57.270 --> 02:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
penalty for this so yes this is already
 
02:28:59.670 --> 02:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
illegal but my point still stands
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's hunting whether it's atvs
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
but have you that if it's somebody who's
 
02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:05.990 align:start position:0%
but have you that if it's somebody who's
rabidly

02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
rabidly
 
02:29:07.510 --> 02:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know supporting a
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
certain position
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
if they're willing to break the law then
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
they're certainly willing to go and put
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
a nail up so if you're not seeing those
 
02:29:15.990 --> 02:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
people putting those signs up then
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
there's no effective difference between
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
them doing that and painting
 
02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
thank you well
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
currently if you put a posted sign up it
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
has the landowner's name and number on
 
02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:33.030 align:start position:0%
has the landowner's name and number on
it

02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
a spray paint
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
would be a lot easier
 
02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:37.429 align:start position:0%
would be a lot easier
and

02:29:37.429 --> 02:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
how you know then people would be oh
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's trespass you know i can't
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
trespass on that property where if the
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
posted signs just up there with no name
 
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
you know people are going to question
 
02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:48.070 align:start position:0%
you know people are going to question
that

02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you again for the clarification
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
but as i said uh representative
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
that this has already gone to court and
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
the courts have repeatedly ruled that
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
actually they don't need a personal
 
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
contact information on that sign if if
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
the intent of the landowner is clear if
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
that sign says no trespassing then
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
people are to abide by that
 
02:30:10.469 --> 02:30:10.479 align:start position:0%
and one last follow-up
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
yep thank you
 
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
would you be objected if we change the
 
02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:16.469 align:start position:0%
would you be objected if we change the
fine

02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
fine
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
from a class b misdemeanor because i i
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
just see in my eyes of this being an
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
issue of people spray painting purple
 
02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
everywhere so that that wish not to see
 
02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
these four wheelers and snowmobiles uh
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
to like a felony charge
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
um i personally for the purposes of this
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
bill don't necessarily have a problem
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
with it i would like to point out that
 
02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:40.230 align:start position:0%
with it i would like to point out that
um

02:30:40.230 --> 02:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
lines 15 and 16 already exist in our
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
current law this is not something i've
 
02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
added in this bill the only thing that's
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
been added is the word paint marks to be
 
02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
inclusive of this new alternative method
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
of posting
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
so um this is something that
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
we've already settled is what we
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
consider to be a class b misdemeanor but
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
if this committee decided that um
 
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
defacing somebody's property or posting
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
on somebody's land that it wasn't their
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
right to post on is something that is
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
felony level or maybe you might want to
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
go to class a first
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
before you get to a felony um
 
02:31:16.469 --> 02:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
that's certainly
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
that doesn't touch the intent of my bill
 
02:31:20.630 --> 02:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm as far as this bill is concerned
 
02:31:22.469 --> 02:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
without weighing in on like what should
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't be a felony that it i
 
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
would be fine with that but again that
 
02:31:27.030 --> 02:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
would be up the purview of this
 
02:31:32.070 --> 02:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:37.110 --> 02:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:39.110 --> 02:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
my question how would this bill
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
distinguish between a landowner that
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
would allow people to walk his land
 
02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
or possibly allow people to use a
 
02:31:51.830 --> 02:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
snowmobile or an atv but not allow
 
02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:53.830 align:start position:0%
snowmobile or an atv but not allow
hunting

02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
hunting
 
02:31:55.429 --> 02:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question it's a good
 
02:31:57.830 --> 02:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
question and the thing is this does not
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
remove the current method the current
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
method specifically states and it gives
 
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
an example of no hunting or trespassing
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
states that you can prohibit certain
 
02:32:07.429 --> 02:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
activities without prohibiting all
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
trespassers so if you want to be
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
granular and say i would like i'm fine
 
02:32:14.150 --> 02:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
with certain activities on my land but i
 
02:32:15.910 --> 02:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't want these other activities you
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
can still use the current method and put
 
02:32:21.030 --> 02:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
those signs up saying no atvs or atv's
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay no hunting or hunting okay no
 
02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:24.870 align:start position:0%
okay no hunting or hunting okay no
whatever

02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
you can still you can already do that
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
and you would still be able to do that
 
02:32:30.790 --> 02:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
with this what this does is just allow a
 
02:32:33.110 --> 02:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
very easy safe quick way
 
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
for people especially people who
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
currently find it very difficult to go
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
around the perimeter of their likely
 
02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
wooded and rocky land
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
who may find it physically difficult
 
02:32:46.469 --> 02:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
to put a more durable way to post
 
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
everything up which is not to say that
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
they won't allow people on their land
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
just as you all know currently you can
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
post no trespassing and then give
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
particular people the right to be on
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
your land to hunt you can invite your
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
friends over to a party just because you
 
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
have no trespassing doesn't mean people
 
02:33:01.750 --> 02:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
can't come it means they need your
 
02:33:04.070 --> 02:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
verbal permission so all of that can
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
still happen this just provides an
 
02:33:08.790 --> 02:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
alternative for people to express their
 
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:18.309 --> 02:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
there being no further questions thank
 
02:33:21.910 --> 02:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
morning

02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for allowing
 
02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
me to speak i don't have
 
02:33:40.790 --> 02:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
a whole lot but i was just going to say
 
02:33:43.110 --> 02:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'm a i'm a landowner i don't have a
 
02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
whole lot of land but i have woods
 
02:33:46.070 --> 02:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
behind me
 
02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
and there's trails out there there's a
 
02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:48.630 align:start position:0%
and there's trails out there there's a
wetland

02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
wetland
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i but i don't post and part of the
 
02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
reason i don't post is because i don't
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
want to put my name and address
 
02:33:57.270 --> 02:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
out there for everyone to see
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
so it's a privacy reason i also don't
 
02:34:01.590 --> 02:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
like the idea of putting signs in the
 
02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:02.550 align:start position:0%
like the idea of putting signs in the
woods

02:34:02.550 --> 02:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
woods
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
that uh pollute and i'm a little bit of
 
02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
an environmentalist also
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
and these signs you probably think that
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
paper but they're not they're made of a
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
synthetic material and the second page
 
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
of my
 
02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:15.670 align:start position:0%
of my
testimony

02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
talks about what what the signs are made
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
of they are plastic
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
they will be there for a long long time
 
02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
they do not decompose and um
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
animals everyone knows that animals are
 
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
like small children they see something
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the woods and they like to put it in
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
their mouth and um
 
02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you just saw that turtle
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
that swallowed the ribbon on the news
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
and had to have surgery uh that's what
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
animals do they see something and they
 
02:34:46.469 --> 02:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
like to ingest it
 
02:34:46.479 --> 02:34:47.349 align:start position:0%
like to ingest it
um

02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:48.950 --> 02:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
so it's dangerous these signs are
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous for the the wildlife out there
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
i guess that's about it that's the
 
02:34:58.950 --> 02:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
reason i don't post i would put
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
paint on my trees but
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
these signs are not good for the
 
02:35:03.359 --> 02:35:05.830 align:start position:0%
these signs are not good for the
environment

02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:35:09.270 --> 02:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.469 --> 02:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.309 --> 02:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me i um
 
02:35:35.270 --> 02:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
i'm actually uh in support of this bill
 
02:35:38.070 --> 02:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh very strongly
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
the thing is property owners landowners
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
we have the right to post our property
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
we have the right to post against
 
02:35:46.080 --> 02:35:47.349 align:start position:0%
we have the right to post against
trespass

02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
trespass
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
however like the onus of hardship is
 
02:35:52.630 --> 02:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
incredible for the landowner what we
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
have to do on our property
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
every year is we have to go around the
 
02:35:58.710 --> 02:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
perimeter we have to check for these
 
02:35:58.720 --> 02:35:59.750 align:start position:0%
perimeter we have to check for these
signs

02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
signs
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes they get ripped off they get ripped
 
02:36:06.469 --> 02:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
down the animals do chew on them it it
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
every year we have to pay for the signs
 
02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
we actually because they get ripped down
 
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
so easily we lug a ladder through the
 
02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:15.030 align:start position:0%
so easily we lug a ladder through the
woods

02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
woods
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
climb up this ladder and put nails into
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
our trees
 
02:36:21.429 --> 02:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
and nails are not good for trees so now
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
we have the choice do we harm our trees
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
just to exercise our right to post our
 
02:36:29.670 --> 02:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
property it shouldn't be that difficult
 
02:36:32.309 --> 02:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize that new hampshire
 
02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
fish and game strongly strongly suggests
 
02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
that hunters contact the land owner
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
before they hunt no it's not required
 
02:36:43.830 --> 02:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
but they strongly urge that because
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
there has been increasing issues
 
02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
with hunters
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
littering putting up illegal tree stands
 
02:36:53.910 --> 02:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
and and issues like that and and with
 
02:36:56.070 --> 02:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
this purple paint it just makes it
 
02:36:59.190 --> 02:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
easier now if i didn't have a partner
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'm five foot one
 
02:37:03.990 --> 02:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
i weigh 106 pounds am i supposed to lug
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
a ladder through the woods to exercise
 
02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
my rights to post my property why why is
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
it that difficult it shouldn't be that
 
02:37:13.510 --> 02:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
difficult and here's the thing even if
 
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
your land is painted with these purple
 
02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:16.870 align:start position:0%
your land is painted with these purple
stripes

02:37:16.870 --> 02:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
stripes
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
since fish and games says please contact
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
the landowner
 
02:37:24.469 --> 02:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
they it's it's fine that some of these
 
02:37:26.870 --> 02:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
people that might have it posted might
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
have a friend or a cousin or brother or
 
02:37:30.790 --> 02:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
an uncle and say it's okay if you you
 
02:37:32.950 --> 02:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
hunt on my land thank you for asking
 
02:37:35.110 --> 02:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you to for coming to me and thank
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
you for giving me some of your harvest
 
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
and then that way they have written
 
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
permission and that person can still
 
02:37:43.830 --> 02:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
hunt on that property it just makes it
 
02:37:47.429 --> 02:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
so that not every random hunter or every
 
02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
random person comes through it gives the
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
land owner
 
02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
discretion with their property and what
 
02:37:55.670 --> 02:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
they do with it it shouldn't be that
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
difficult when we have to go through and
 
02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
we have to we see these signs ripped off
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
or shot at
 
02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:03.429 align:start position:0%
or shot at
it

02:38:03.429 --> 02:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:38:06.309 --> 02:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's just becoming completely a hardship
 
02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
on the land owner and as as far as as as
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
with the colorblind you know i sent in
 
02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
testimony and i sent in some quotes from
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
several sources there's a little bit of
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
confusion on that because some some say
 
02:38:20.230 --> 02:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
that purple is actually one of the
 
02:38:21.990 --> 02:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
colors that's easier for colorblind
 
02:38:25.110 --> 02:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
people to see i don't know however there
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
is also that eight percent
 
02:38:30.469 --> 02:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
of uh males are colorblind so now if you
 
02:38:30.479 --> 02:38:31.270 align:start position:0%
of uh males are colorblind so now if you
have

02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
say very generous a hundred thousand
 
02:38:35.670 --> 02:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
hunters eight percent so you have eight
 
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
thousand hunters and that's generous and
 
02:38:39.990 --> 02:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're colorblind so now
 
02:38:42.309 --> 02:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of thousands of people that
 
02:38:43.990 --> 02:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
own property
 
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:38:47.910 --> 02:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
our our rights are not easy we can't
 
02:38:49.590 --> 02:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
exercise those rights because we have to
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
worry about a few thousand hunters that
 
02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:52.950 align:start position:0%
worry about a few thousand hunters that
can't

02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
ask their buddy and say hey i'm scouting
 
02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
out this property i see this paint on
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
this tree hey can you tell me what color
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
that is it's that simple
 
02:39:03.670 --> 02:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
it you know when i see all of these
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
discussions against this it's it's
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's just frustrating as as property
 
02:39:10.710 --> 02:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
owners because i also know several
 
02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:11.590 align:start position:0%
owners because i also know several
people

02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
some elderly people you know my parents
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
they wanted to post their property no
 
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
way is is my 80 year old father gonna
 
02:39:20.950 --> 02:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
get up on a ladder
 
02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
you know so i have to go and help him
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
and do that it just it just shouldn't be
 
02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
that difficult this isn't going to stop
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
hunting it's just going to to make it
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
easier for the landowner and
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's pretty much all i
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
when you say
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting up on the ladder you you get up
 
02:39:49.830 --> 02:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
on a ladder to post a sign
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
because you're trying to put the sign
 
02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
out of reach of somebody who could
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
easily tear it down is that the
 
02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:57.190 align:start position:0%
easily tear it down is that the
rationale

02:39:57.190 --> 02:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
rationale
 
02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
yes previous we would just go uh with my
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
partner and he would reach up as far as
 
02:40:03.349 --> 02:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
he could
 
02:40:06.070 --> 02:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh and then he he'd tack in into the
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
tree with the nails destroying the tree
 
02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
which we we took the chance and we did
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
and what we found was yeah they were
 
02:40:14.150 --> 02:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
easier because anybody could just go
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
through and just it's easier for them to
 
02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
just be pulled down and we did find that
 
02:40:20.309 --> 02:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
when we lug the ladder through the woods
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
and put the signs up higher
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little more difficult for
 
02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
them to get ripped down and and
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:35.910 --> 02:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:40.950 --> 02:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%

all set
 
02:41:09.429 --> 02:41:09.439 align:start position:0%

the department of natural and cultural
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
resources division of forests and lands
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
does not take a position on this bill
 
02:41:33.670 --> 02:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to offer the following
 
02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:36.550 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to offer the following
comments

02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
the division of forest and lands is the
 
02:41:39.910 --> 02:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
state agency charged with the execution
 
02:41:41.830 --> 02:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
of all matters pertaining to forestry
 
02:41:43.349 --> 02:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
forest management
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
and forest lands within the jurisdiction
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
02:41:47.429 --> 02:41:47.439 align:start position:0%
one of the division's key
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is to enforce the state
 
02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
timber harvesting laws including cases
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
of timber trespass
 
02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:53.830 align:start position:0%
of timber trespass
where

02:41:53.830 --> 02:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:41:55.830 --> 02:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
boundaries are very critical part of
 
02:41:58.630 --> 02:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
that enforcement and also to main uh
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
manage forest fire protection programs
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
and activities in cooperation with local
 
02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:03.750 align:start position:0%
and activities in cooperation with local
municipalities

02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh the division of forest lands uh we
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
manage about 170 000 acres of state land
 
02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
we also manage about 60 000 acres of
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
land for the new hampshire fish and game
 
02:42:17.349 --> 02:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
department and 13 000 acres of land for
 
02:42:17.359 --> 02:42:18.230 align:start position:0%
department and 13 000 acres of land for
the

02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
army corps of engineers in the flood
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
control areas of the state
 
02:42:24.550 --> 02:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
i've also been a forester for about 35
 
02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:26.950 align:start position:0%
i've also been a forester for about 35
years

02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
so this bill as proposed raises several
 
02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
concerns for us
 
02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
purple boundary paint to indicate no
 
02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
trespassing is a completely uncommon
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
practice in the northeast and is not
 
02:42:39.429 --> 02:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
widely recognized by the majority of
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
landowners foresters surveyors and
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
forest recreationists
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
posted signs are well recognized and can
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
be easily added or removed
 
02:42:50.630 --> 02:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
as the landowner desires or ownerships
 
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
change as opposed to essentially
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
permanent paint marking
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i've listened intently to the the
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
previous speakers and i understand the
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
frustration and concern but
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
um consulting with a forester to advise
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
them on how to how to attach these signs
 
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
to a tree
 
02:43:08.710 --> 02:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
would be worth their while
 
02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
you can use a half inch or quarter
 
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
quarter inch galvanized nail
 
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
and and just tap that into the tree
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
you don't even have to tap it in
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
completely to hold a very light vinyl
 
02:43:19.439 --> 02:43:20.389 align:start position:0%
completely to hold a very light vinyl
sign

02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
sign
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
so the nailing does not destroy the tree
 
02:43:25.269 --> 02:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily and
 
02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
can still be considered a valuable
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
timber product
 
02:43:31.429 --> 02:43:31.439 align:start position:0%
as far as posting goes the landowner's
 
02:43:33.429 --> 02:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
name and address on posted signs we
 
02:43:35.510 --> 02:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
believe that should remain a requirement
 
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
of this law
 
02:43:39.030 --> 02:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
having landowners contact information
 
02:43:41.349 --> 02:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
facilitates communication
 
02:43:42.870 --> 02:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
so i don't see why
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
we would want to remove the ability for
 
02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
forest visitors to be able to understand
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
whose land they're on
 
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
you it's just another form of
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
communication and i also realize it's
 
02:43:54.630 --> 02:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
not well
 
02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:55.590 align:start position:0%
not well
uh

02:43:55.590 --> 02:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:57.670 --> 02:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
followed by the by many landowners they
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
might put their name but don't want to
 
02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
put their address and the other speakers
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
are correct you a lot of times you can
 
02:44:04.389 --> 02:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
find it in the tax rolls but that's only
 
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
if those tax rolls and that tax
 
02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
information is online some towns do not
 
02:44:10.150 --> 02:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
have all that information online
 
02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:10.950 align:start position:0%
have all that information online
so

02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
having landowners contact information
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
it allows
 
02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
hunters who need to contact the
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
landowner in order to retrieve wounded
 
02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
or killed game
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
temporary access across posted property
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
is also often needed for forestry
 
02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
operations and again this is another
 
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
form of communication that
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
a logger can use to contact the lane
 
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
owner to see if they can cross their
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
land for operations and then of course
 
02:44:38.790 --> 02:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
our our agency is responsible for forest
 
02:44:40.389 --> 02:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
fire suppression
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:44:44.230 --> 02:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
again learning that the name and address
 
02:44:46.710 --> 02:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
of the landowner allows us to facilitate
 
02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
access for fire suppression activities
 
02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.070 align:start position:0%
access for fire suppression activities
so

02:44:52.070 --> 02:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:53.830 --> 02:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
the pain in the current posting law we
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
feel is a well-established time tested
 
02:44:55.760 --> 02:44:57.269 align:start position:0%
feel is a well-established time tested
standard

02:44:57.269 --> 02:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
standard
 
02:44:59.190 --> 02:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
for boundary marking used by licensed
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
surveyors foresters that are far more
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
effective than than the
 
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
provisions proposed in this bill
 
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.760 --> 02:45:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
conley thank you and thank you for
 
02:45:17.269 --> 02:45:17.279 align:start position:0%
taking the question i live in a
 
02:45:19.030 --> 02:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
small city but a city nonetheless so
 
02:45:20.630 --> 02:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
this is an issue i've given much thought
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
to but
 
02:45:25.269 --> 02:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
seems like the property owners are
 
02:45:27.429 --> 02:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
being forced to do a lot of things
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
to meet the letter of the law here and
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm curious why we wouldn't let them
 
02:45:31.359 --> 02:45:32.550 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm curious why we wouldn't let them
choose

02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
choose
 
02:45:33.910 --> 02:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
a method
 
02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:34.950 align:start position:0%
a method
choose

02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
choose
 
02:45:36.550 --> 02:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
one or more method or an alternative
 
02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
method to post their property
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
versus what's in statute i'm wondering
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern thank you for the
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
question representative the biggest
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
concern is the confusion that it would
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
cause i mean there are going to be very
 
02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
few visitors to the forest that are
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
going to understand what purple paint is
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
signs are typically the standard
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh posted signs if you really want to
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
send a message that your land is posted
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's what this law does it provides
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
the sideboards for that purple paint is
 
02:46:06.479 --> 02:46:07.269 align:start position:0%
the sideboards for that purple paint is
just

02:46:07.269 --> 02:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
i've as i mentioned i've been a forester
 
02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
for three three and a half decades
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
i've walked forests from northern maine
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
to western new york
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
and everywhere in between in between
 
02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
purple's just not the color i mean it
 
02:46:21.750 --> 02:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
might be in other states
 
02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
but it's just not going to be well
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
recognized and cause confusion
 
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative calling thank you
 
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be on the onus of whomever
 
02:46:31.910 --> 02:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
intends to cross onto private property
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
whatever the rule is whatever the law is
 
02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:36.790 align:start position:0%
whatever the rule is whatever the law is
that

02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:46:38.950 --> 02:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
they are following the law before they
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
traipse onto another person's property
 
02:46:43.349 --> 02:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't this ensure that
 
02:46:45.269 --> 02:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
purple orange
 
02:46:45.279 --> 02:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
purple orange
signs

02:46:47.030 --> 02:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
signs
 
02:46:49.110 --> 02:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
i guess the questions could they still
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
achieve that
 
02:46:52.230 --> 02:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
and shouldn't they still achieve that
 
02:46:55.990 --> 02:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
so we have an open door policy in new
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
england as you may know where if the
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
land is not posted
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
then it's assumed that that individual
 
02:47:05.670 --> 02:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
can walk onto the land
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
02:47:09.429 --> 02:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
that's basically how it how it exists
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
here in new england
 
02:47:12.870 --> 02:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
so signage is the one way to communicate
 
02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:15.269 align:start position:0%
so signage is the one way to communicate
that

02:47:15.269 --> 02:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
if you own land of any significance
 
02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
beyond a house lot
 
02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's it behooves landowner to paint
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
their boundaries and make them very
 
02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
visible they do that with a blaze a
 
02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
blaze is an ax mark that
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
takes it down to the to the bare wood
 
02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then it's painted with an
 
02:47:33.910 --> 02:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
all-purpose weatherproof paint that
 
02:47:36.469 --> 02:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
lasts between 10 and 15 years
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
so the onus is on the landowner to
 
02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
define their boundaries to ensure that
 
02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
no one trespasses
 
02:47:43.349 --> 02:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
or at least they they know they're
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
crossing a change in ownership
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
but the color of the paint is typically
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
as traditionally not
 
02:47:51.990 --> 02:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
does not communicate that that that is
 
02:47:54.150 --> 02:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
posted it just mentions it just
 
02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
indicates you're crossing a boundary
 
02:47:55.439 --> 02:47:58.309 align:start position:0%
indicates you're crossing a boundary
line

02:47:58.309 --> 02:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
02:48:01.670 --> 02:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:48:03.269 --> 02:48:03.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
does the current statute require nails
 
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
or would zip ties work
 
02:48:10.550 --> 02:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think it requires how it should
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
be attached to the tree
 
02:48:15.030 --> 02:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
02:48:19.190 --> 02:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:20.950 --> 02:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question one
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the things i'm a little confused
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
about is is is your standing here so in
 
02:48:27.590 --> 02:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony uh you said the division
 
02:48:31.190 --> 02:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
of forests and lands manages 170 000
 
02:48:33.990 --> 02:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
acres of of state land
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
but what we're talking about here are
 
02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
private landowners
 
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh not not the state
 
02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:41.670 align:start position:0%
uh not not the state
so

02:48:41.670 --> 02:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:43.110 --> 02:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
does your
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
agency actually have just jurisdiction
 
02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
over private landowners
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
part of our declaration of purpose as an
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
agency i'm sorry i can't see you with
 
02:48:56.830 --> 02:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
the speaker in the way
 
02:48:59.590 --> 02:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
um is that
 
02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
we we promote
 
02:49:04.630 --> 02:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
a thriving forest products industry and
 
02:49:06.950 --> 02:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
good forestry so we provide education
 
02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
outreach to landowners as part of our
 
02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:09.910 align:start position:0%
outreach to landowners as part of our
mission

mission
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so the interests of private forest
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
land owners is baked into our mission so
 
02:49:17.269 --> 02:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm here today is to kind of
 
02:49:17.279 --> 02:49:18.389 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm here today is to kind of
represent

02:49:18.389 --> 02:49:18.399 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:49:19.670 --> 02:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
landowners who are trying to manage
 
02:49:23.429 --> 02:49:23.439 align:start position:0%
their land um that and we support and
 
02:49:25.349 --> 02:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh support
 
02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know their their efforts which
 
02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:33.030 --> 02:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative muse you recognize for a
 
02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:34.469 align:start position:0%
representative muse you recognize for a
follow-up

02:49:34.469 --> 02:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
would you say
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of your relationship to private
 
02:49:39.429 --> 02:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
landowners you consider yourself to be
 
02:49:41.429 --> 02:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
more of a resource for them
 
02:49:43.750 --> 02:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely education information unh
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension
 
02:49:47.590 --> 02:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
is a strategic partner in that in that
 
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
effort and they provide training they
 
02:49:50.550 --> 02:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
want to say training but they provide
 
02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
outreach workshops to private land
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
owners and funding comes from the u.s
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
foreign service through us to extension
 
02:50:00.230 --> 02:50:00.240 align:start position:0%

02:50:02.230 --> 02:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:08.790 --> 02:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative burt thank you mr
 
02:50:09.750 --> 02:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
02:50:12.389 --> 02:50:12.399 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
you've touched
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit on it somebody sent me a
 
02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
message about
 
02:50:18.790 --> 02:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
if if you could explain
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
what common land rule is in new
 
02:50:23.190 --> 02:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire compared to some of the other
 
02:50:26.550 --> 02:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
states i believe that have this law that
 
02:50:29.429 --> 02:50:29.439 align:start position:0%
do not have common land rule if you
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
could explain what that means
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know the definition of
 
02:50:36.070 --> 02:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
common land rule what in the context of
 
02:50:37.269 --> 02:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker mentioned
 
02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
commonland rule
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman follow-up
 
02:50:44.309 --> 02:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
recognized for follow-up thank you uh no
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh no they didn't mention competition
 
02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is common land rule and
 
02:50:51.269 --> 02:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
you touched base on it that
 
02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire if the land's not
 
02:50:55.910 --> 02:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
posted i can walk on it until asked to
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
leave yes where some of the other states
 
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
are not that that use this striping as a
 
02:51:03.910 --> 02:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
color sure yeah yeah if you could just
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
explain what you know the difference
 
02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
between some states in new hampshire is
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
that i'm allowed to do certain things
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
where i'm not in other states sure all
 
02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have the knowledge in terms of
 
02:51:20.230 --> 02:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
what other states do i was the first
 
02:51:21.830 --> 02:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
time i'd heard that pennsylvania does
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
that that actually they have they allow
 
02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
the landowner to paint it in purple
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
um but i can tell you that that is
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
unusual in the northeast as far as the
 
02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
common land um
 
02:51:34.469 --> 02:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
private land ownership is obviously a
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
cherished right of
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
of everyone in america
 
02:51:40.319 --> 02:51:41.590 align:start position:0%
of everyone in america
um

02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
in new england we do have a it's it's
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
actually a wonderful tradition that
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
people will leave their land
 
02:51:50.070 --> 02:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
unposted to allow for for
 
02:51:52.790 --> 02:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
responsible public use
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if it's the same term
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
common land versus
 
02:51:59.040 --> 02:51:59.830 align:start position:0%
common land versus
um

02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
open door policy if you will or open
 
02:52:03.910 --> 02:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
gate policy but
 
02:52:06.309 --> 02:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
that is essentially what um it's been
 
02:52:08.309 --> 02:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
called for many decades in new england
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
now that tradition is eroding as we all
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
know more and more people are posting
 
02:52:13.349 --> 02:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
their land for various reasons that's
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
their right
 
02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
but in new england by and large we still
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous amount of open land
 
02:52:21.750 --> 02:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
people that
 
02:52:24.150 --> 02:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
allow the public to recreate on it our
 
02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
statewide trail system as you may have
 
02:52:27.349 --> 02:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
is dependent
 
02:52:31.110 --> 02:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
on private landowners being willing
 
02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
to allow trails across their property
 
02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a wonderful
 
02:52:38.230 --> 02:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
tradition and we're trying to protect
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
that by promoting responsible private
 
02:52:43.510 --> 02:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
use of public oh i'm sorry private
 
02:52:45.750 --> 02:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
responsible private use of of private
 
02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:48.309 align:start position:0%
responsible private use of of private
lands

02:52:48.309 --> 02:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:49.190 --> 02:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:51.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
sure

02:52:51.910 --> 02:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative pratt
 
02:52:56.230 --> 02:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
i just have one question uh you
 
02:52:58.630 --> 02:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier machete slashing and
 
02:52:58.640 --> 02:52:59.590 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier machete slashing and
painting

02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
painting
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's just acceptable practice
 
02:53:03.269 --> 02:53:03.279 align:start position:0%
well machete would be probably not the
 
02:53:05.349 --> 02:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
most useful tool but a blaze yeah we
 
02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
call it a blaze in forestry lingo so who
 
02:53:11.510 --> 02:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:13.910 --> 02:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
surveyors do it all the time uh
 
02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
foresters can also do it but it's
 
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
consist considered a physical monument
 
02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
that's once that's that blaze is made
 
02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
it has to be made by a licensed surveyor
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
to become a monument
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
that can be painted like i said
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
depending on the the conditions of the
 
02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
forest if it's high elevation you
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
probably have to paint at least every 10
 
02:53:32.479 --> 02:53:33.269 align:start position:0%
probably have to paint at least every 10
years

02:53:33.269 --> 02:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:53:35.030 --> 02:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
if it's in a in a place where the
 
02:53:38.710 --> 02:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:41.269 --> 02:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know every 15 years might be good
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's one follow-up
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up
 
02:53:47.429 --> 02:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
so you have borderline trees it's okay
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
for a severe to come through and slash
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
your tree and paint it
 
02:53:54.070 --> 02:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
good question thank you um
 
02:53:54.080 --> 02:53:56.309 align:start position:0%
good question thank you um
so

02:53:56.309 --> 02:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:58.230 --> 02:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
when you paint the trees
 
02:53:59.670 --> 02:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
you really
 
02:54:02.230 --> 02:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
have to have physical monuments usually
 
02:54:03.910 --> 02:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's a previous blaze mark that
 
02:54:05.990 --> 02:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're working off of if a landowner is
 
02:54:08.630 --> 02:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
not sure if they don't have a
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
licensed survey completed on their
 
02:54:10.720 --> 02:54:11.910 align:start position:0%
licensed survey completed on their
property

02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
they would be well advised to work with
 
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
their adjacent lane owner to walk that
 
02:54:19.110 --> 02:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
02:54:29.269 --> 02:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls
 
02:54:44.469 --> 02:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:45.990 --> 02:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee i'm roy schweiker from concord
 
02:54:50.950 --> 02:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i'd ask your indulgence i only asked
 
02:54:52.710 --> 02:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
for a couple of minutes to speak but i
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
think i can answer some of the questions
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
that have been given and respond to some
 
02:54:57.990 --> 02:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
of the things have been said so i'd like
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with new
 
02:55:02.880 --> 02:55:03.910 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do with new
hampshire

02:55:03.910 --> 02:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:55:05.429 --> 02:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
but it has something to do with marking
 
02:55:05.439 --> 02:55:06.710 align:start position:0%
but it has something to do with marking
land

02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
land
 
02:55:09.190 --> 02:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
for five years i've been a volunteer for
 
02:55:10.950 --> 02:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
the national park service
 
02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
maintaining the boundaries of the
 
02:55:14.830 --> 02:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
appalachian trail which goes through the
 
02:55:17.670 --> 02:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
woods and we
 
02:55:19.110 --> 02:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
have a boundary it's a very long
 
02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:20.150 align:start position:0%
have a boundary it's a very long
boundary

02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
boundary
 
02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
and there are volunteers that go out and
 
02:55:24.070 --> 02:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
maintain it we use a special yellow
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
paint that has some special chemical in
 
02:55:27.429 --> 02:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
it that only the federal government can
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
use so nobody else can sneak up and put
 
02:55:30.640 --> 02:55:31.510 align:start position:0%
use so nobody else can sneak up and put
the

02:55:31.510 --> 02:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:55:34.469 --> 02:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
official yellow blazes that we use
 
02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the way it works is a licensed
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
surveyor went through they set metal
 
02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:40.550 align:start position:0%
surveyor went through they set metal
monuments

02:55:40.550 --> 02:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
monuments
 
02:55:42.389 --> 02:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
and they blaze trees
 
02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
and trees that are on the line with the
 
02:55:46.950 --> 02:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
blaze facing along the line and trees
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
are when a certain distance of the line
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
is ablated on the side of the tree
 
02:55:52.790 --> 02:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
all these yellow
 
02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:54.230 align:start position:0%
all these yellow
and

02:55:54.230 --> 02:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
that's how the property is marked
 
02:55:58.710 --> 02:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
and the problem we have is there are
 
02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
places where there aren't trees
 
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
and therefore you can't put glazes on
 
02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:03.510 align:start position:0%
and therefore you can't put glazes on
them

02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:56:05.110 --> 02:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of hard to follow the line
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
through there if it's bushes
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
i go out and i put up surveyors tape
 
02:56:10.710 --> 02:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
because that's not a legal boundary
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
marker so i can do it
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
but of course that doesn't last as long
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
and our experience
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
with the
 
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
appalachian trail is more like five
 
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
years that the blazes start to fade
 
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
and remember that these blades are
 
02:56:25.670 --> 02:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
bright yellow
 
02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
so they're designed to be visible
 
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so therefore if the bright yellow
 
02:56:32.469 --> 02:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
paint with a special chemical is fading
 
02:56:33.750 --> 02:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
in five years
 
02:56:34.950 --> 02:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
i think the landowners are going to
 
02:56:36.150 --> 02:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
discover that
 
02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
they're maybe not quite so good paint
 
02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
maybe fade quicker than that
 
02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
and the other thing about it is we also
 
02:56:45.429 --> 02:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
have property signs we put up
 
02:56:45.439 --> 02:56:46.150 align:start position:0%
have property signs we put up
and

02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
those are plastic signs
 
02:56:50.870 --> 02:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
and they do degrade over time
 
02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:51.750 align:start position:0%
and they do degrade over time
they

02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
come loose and whatnot we have to pick
 
02:56:54.790 --> 02:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
them off and take them away and put up
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
new ones
 
02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
and we do not use galvanized nails
 
02:57:01.349 --> 02:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
we use aluminum nails
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
so if somehow that nail is left in the
 
02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
tree it's less likely to affect the
 
02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
sauce somebody happens to saw into it
 
02:57:09.670 --> 02:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
but the chief thing i want to say about
 
02:57:11.429 --> 02:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
this painting and
 
02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
putting up signs is putting up signs is
 
02:57:15.590 --> 02:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
far easier
 
02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
to go out and paint a section of that
 
02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
you can't even do a mile and a day
 
02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:20.389 align:start position:0%
you can't even do a mile and a day
probably

02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know just going finding every tree
 
02:57:23.590 --> 02:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
putting paint on it
 
02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
whereas the signs you can walk right
 
02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:28.309 align:start position:0%
whereas the signs you can walk right
along

02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
she was talking about 100 yards
 
02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:31.429 align:start position:0%
she was talking about 100 yards
we

02:57:31.429 --> 02:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:57:32.950 --> 02:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
do them
 
02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
usually every 200 feet because the
 
02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
monuments are 400 feet apart and we put
 
02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
one halfway in between
 
02:57:40.950 --> 02:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
we can put up those markers a whole lot
 
02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:42.150 align:start position:0%
we can put up those markers a whole lot
quicker

02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
02:57:44.150 --> 02:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
than we could paint the thing so
 
02:57:46.710 --> 02:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
painting is not easier it's harder
 
02:57:48.309 --> 02:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
to the extent that the
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
signs can stay up and don't have to be
 
02:57:52.389 --> 02:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
replaced every year
 
02:57:52.399 --> 02:57:53.269 align:start position:0%
replaced every year
and

02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:57:55.990 --> 02:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
if i say we use the aluminum nails
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
so theoretically they won't damage the
 
02:58:00.710 --> 02:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
saw blades if the tree gets logged
 
02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:02.150 align:start position:0%
saw blades if the tree gets logged
and

02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:58:03.429 --> 02:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know i suppose you could use a
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
tie except a lot of the trees are too
 
02:58:07.269 --> 02:58:07.279 align:start position:0%
big around you need an awfully long tie
 
02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
and depending on the species if it
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the rough bar maybe you use
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
staples which once again probably
 
02:58:14.230 --> 02:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't damage the saw and wouldn't go
 
02:58:16.469 --> 02:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
in very far into the wood so
 
02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
i don't see that
 
02:58:21.030 --> 02:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
the sign the signs are easier to put up
 
02:58:23.349 --> 02:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
but you may have to put up more often
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
and they don't damage the tree if you do
 
02:58:27.269 --> 02:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
it properly
 
02:58:27.279 --> 02:58:28.389 align:start position:0%
it properly
and

02:58:28.389 --> 02:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:58:30.309 --> 02:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
the paint may not last as long as people
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
are talking about if you want to be
 
02:58:33.990 --> 02:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
visible you want the stuff to be close
 
02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.590 align:start position:0%
visible you want the stuff to be close
together

02:58:35.590 --> 02:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's my experience from
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
vermont on marking boundaries
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
the other thing i wanted to say has to
 
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
do with this
 
02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
common land or whatever that you know
 
02:58:46.319 --> 02:58:47.110 align:start position:0%
common land or whatever that you know
that's

02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:58:48.550 --> 02:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
left over from the native americans
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
originally you know they didn't own land
 
02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
they just traveled through it used it as
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
they needed it and it's in the british
 
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
common law that seems to have come into
 
02:58:57.670 --> 02:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
new england
 
02:58:57.680 --> 02:58:58.870 align:start position:0%
new england
and

02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
i like it
 
02:59:01.120 --> 02:59:02.630 align:start position:0%
i like it
and

02:59:02.630 --> 02:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
an example in vermont if you think
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
handlings have a tough in new hampshire
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
in vermont you not only have to put your
 
02:59:10.230 --> 02:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
name on the sign you've got to date it
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:59:12.630 --> 02:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
you've got to go to the town office and
 
02:59:15.030 --> 02:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
record it and pay what's a nominal fee
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
but it's a lot more trouble
 
02:59:16.880 --> 02:59:17.830 align:start position:0%
but it's a lot more trouble
because

02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
in vermont apparently they have this
 
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:21.120 align:start position:0%
attitude that you know land should be
 
02:59:21.120 --> 02:59:22.070 align:start position:0%
attitude that you know land should be
open

02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:59:23.269 --> 02:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
and they're willing to make it a little
 
02:59:25.269 --> 02:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
bit more difficult for the landowner if
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
they want to post it for some reason
 
02:59:31.990 --> 02:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
and as far as the signs themselves
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know my big gripe about them is you
 
02:59:35.670 --> 02:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
go to the hardware store you can buy a
 
02:59:37.349 --> 02:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
sign that says no trespassing for any
 
02:59:37.359 --> 02:59:38.230 align:start position:0%
sign that says no trespassing for any
purpose

02:59:38.230 --> 02:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:59:39.510 --> 02:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
really cheap
 
02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
and people tend to put those up
 
02:59:43.269 --> 02:59:43.279 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to indicate the
 
02:59:45.269 --> 02:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
particular things that they want you to
 
02:59:46.710 --> 02:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
stay away from
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
but you know that's merely a gripe
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people now have found
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
some way to get a sign that says no
 
02:59:53.429 --> 02:59:53.439 align:start position:0%
hunting with bear dogs
 
02:59:55.190 --> 02:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
because they're particularly opposed to
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
that i'm sure that cost them far more
 
03:00:00.630 --> 03:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
than just buying a generic sign
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
and as far as contacting people
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
this place in vermont they put up a sign
 
03:00:06.790 --> 03:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
no hunting without permission that's
 
03:00:06.800 --> 03:00:07.830 align:start position:0%
no hunting without permission that's
great

03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:00:10.230 --> 03:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
that's not a legal sign in vermont but
 
03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:00:12.389 --> 03:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
like people have said you know don't you
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
want to do what the landowner wants
 
03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i decided i would contact these
 
03:00:18.230 --> 03:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
people well guess what
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the name on the sign
 
03:00:22.070 --> 03:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't a legal sign anyway
 
03:00:24.630 --> 03:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
so i have to go first to the topographic
 
03:00:26.630 --> 03:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
maps to try and figure out where this is
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
that particular town had the
 
03:00:31.110 --> 03:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
tax maps online so i was able to find
 
03:00:32.790 --> 03:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
out the
 
03:00:35.030 --> 03:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
partial number and i was able to contact
 
03:00:37.510 --> 03:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
the town office in vermont it is a
 
03:00:40.389 --> 03:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
public record the owner of a parcel
 
03:00:42.389 --> 03:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
so they were able to give me the name
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
and address of the person who owned that
 
03:00:46.550 --> 03:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
parcel and then i was able to contact
 
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
him and say can i go hiking on your
 
03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
piece of prop and i said sure
 
03:00:51.590 --> 03:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
but you know i was a very convoluted
 
03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:52.710 align:start position:0%
but you know i was a very convoluted
system

03:00:52.710 --> 03:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:00:55.030 --> 03:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
and this is why it would be nice
 
03:00:56.710 --> 03:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
you know once again if people want their
 
03:00:59.030 --> 03:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
property to be used for the purpose they
 
03:01:01.510 --> 03:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
want and if they want people to contact
 
03:01:03.349 --> 03:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
themselves sneaking on you know saying
 
03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
that signs illegal so i'm going to
 
03:01:06.630 --> 03:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
ignore it would really help if they
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the fact that some people
 
03:01:13.110 --> 03:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
might be interested in
 
03:01:15.030 --> 03:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know doing the right thing
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go hunt on your land
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
with bear dogs you have a sign that says
 
03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:18.550 align:start position:0%
with bear dogs you have a sign that says
that

03:01:18.550 --> 03:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:19.269 align:start position:0%
that
but

03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:01:20.790 --> 03:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
how can i
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to tell you you've got
 
03:01:23.510 --> 03:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
things to do i'm going to tell you more
 
03:01:25.349 --> 03:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
stories about dealings i've had with
 
03:01:27.670 --> 03:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
landowners but anyway that's my feeling
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think that the paint
 
03:01:31.030 --> 03:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
like the previous gentleman said is not
 
03:01:32.309 --> 03:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
going to be recognized so it's not going
 
03:01:34.230 --> 03:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
to have the effect it's going to be far
 
03:01:36.550 --> 03:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
more trouble to deal with than you think
 
03:01:38.630 --> 03:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
the guy who buys that land and doesn't
 
03:01:40.550 --> 03:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
want to post it
 
03:01:41.830 --> 03:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's another thing i've had experience
 
03:01:43.349 --> 03:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
with it takes twice as much to cover up
 
03:01:44.790 --> 03:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
the paint as it did to paint it
 
03:01:46.630 --> 03:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
originally he's not going to do it so
 
03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
that land is going to be you know out of
 
03:01:50.389 --> 03:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
the system for ever just because one
 
03:01:53.030 --> 03:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
person put up some purple paint
 
03:01:54.710 --> 03:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's why i'm opposed to this
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your

and

03:03:00.950 --> 03:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:03:03.190 --> 03:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
most of i would say most of our members
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
lands are open are open for
 
03:03:07.750 --> 03:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
what we call passive recreation
 
03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
pedestrian recreation
 
03:03:11.429 --> 03:03:11.439 align:start position:0%
and as you heard earlier today that's
 
03:03:14.790 --> 03:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a new england tradition
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
but there are people that do post and
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
they post for a variety of reasons
 
03:03:21.110 --> 03:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
either they create safety zones around
 
03:03:25.349 --> 03:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
livestock their buildings their homes
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
things of that nature
 
03:03:27.359 --> 03:03:28.630 align:start position:0%
things of that nature
and

03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
but i've come here today to speak in
 
03:03:32.309 --> 03:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
03:03:32.319 --> 03:03:33.110 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
and

03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:03:35.110 --> 03:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
for a couple reasons
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to belabor it but
 
03:03:39.269 --> 03:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
you've heard some of it already
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
there's a question
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
there's a question about
 
03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's a question about recognition
 
03:03:47.349 --> 03:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
one of our members has land in the state
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
of maine which allows purple paint and
 
03:03:51.590 --> 03:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
when i asked him about it he said you
 
03:03:51.600 --> 03:03:52.469 align:start position:0%
when i asked him about it he said you
know

03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:52.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:03:54.710 --> 03:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
what's maine's experience he said his
 
03:03:56.790 --> 03:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
words to me was it's kind of a joke over
 
03:03:56.800 --> 03:03:57.590 align:start position:0%
words to me was it's kind of a joke over
there

03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:03:59.830 --> 03:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
people don't really know what it means
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not part of the
 
03:04:04.710 --> 03:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
traditional land use and he says it
 
03:04:06.389 --> 03:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
almost create for that landowner it
 
03:04:08.469 --> 03:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
creates more more of an issue
 
03:04:09.990 --> 03:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
than solves
 
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
people understand they recognize signage
 
03:04:15.269 --> 03:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
the signage can get very explicit in
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
no bear dogs no posting for any reason
 
03:04:22.950 --> 03:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
etc so it's
 
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know the the posting itself
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
we believe that the current process
 
03:04:27.359 --> 03:04:28.710 align:start position:0%
we believe that the current process
works

03:04:28.710 --> 03:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
works
 
03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:30.309 align:start position:0%
works
um

03:04:30.309 --> 03:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:32.550 --> 03:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from the state forester
 
03:04:34.389 --> 03:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
there are reasons why you want to have a
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
landowner's name and at least contact
 
03:04:38.710 --> 03:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
information up there
 
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities or reasons where they were
 
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
they you want to facilitate that
 
03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:47.269 align:start position:0%
they you want to facilitate that
communication

03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
communication
 
03:04:49.429 --> 03:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
a game animal travels over onto your
 
03:04:51.429 --> 03:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
property and it's posted
 
03:04:53.510 --> 03:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
give me you know i'd like a heads up
 
03:04:55.190 --> 03:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
okay you're going to retrieve that deer
 
03:04:55.200 --> 03:04:57.510 align:start position:0%
okay you're going to retrieve that deer
great

03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:04:59.670 --> 03:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
the other piece is
 
03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
why you would want is you as you heard
 
03:05:04.230 --> 03:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
earlier fire suppression contact them
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
something's going on out there
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
mr mrs landowner we need to contact you
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
many of our members lands are in remote
 
03:05:15.269 --> 03:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
areas so access to tax maps and in wi-fi
 
03:05:17.670 --> 03:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
hotspots or internet access it's not
 
03:05:19.349 --> 03:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
really an option if you're on the back
 
03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
side of
 
03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
smarts mountain up in the canaan area
 
03:05:25.110 --> 03:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know wi-fi access is just not an
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
option up there but if you have a name
 
03:05:28.150 --> 03:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
up there
 
03:05:30.630 --> 03:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
and you have a an address it's a heck of
 
03:05:32.710 --> 03:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
a lot easier to kind of locate who the
 
03:05:34.790 --> 03:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
person is and kind of track them down if
 
03:05:37.030 --> 03:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
you need to talk to them about
 
03:05:39.349 --> 03:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
accessing their property
 
03:05:41.429 --> 03:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
and again as you heard earlier
 
03:05:41.439 --> 03:05:42.230 align:start position:0%
and again as you heard earlier
paint

03:05:42.230 --> 03:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
paint
 
03:05:44.630 --> 03:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
the paint the property sold the paint
 
03:05:47.269 --> 03:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
remains and now the new landowner has to
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
deal with it granted it could be a
 
03:05:51.910 --> 03:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
condition of sale but it's just another
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's just another variable in the mix
 
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess i i'll i'll conclude my
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
testimony there you've heard it you've
 
03:06:01.590 --> 03:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
heard all the the reasons
 
03:06:03.750 --> 03:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
why this bill we don't feel it's
 
03:06:07.030 --> 03:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
necessary is one of my my policy
 
03:06:08.550 --> 03:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
committee members said this is a
 
03:06:08.560 --> 03:06:09.670 align:start position:0%
committee members said this is a
solution

03:06:09.670 --> 03:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:06:12.230 --> 03:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
looking for a problem right now we have
 
03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
a posting process we have a tradition of
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
open space and land use it's working
 
03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
we really don't this the feeling is this
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill is just not necessary
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
with that i'll conclude my testimony be
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
happy to try and answer any questions
 
03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative roy thank you mr chairman
 
03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
i wonder if there if there isn't some
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
room for compromise
 
03:06:38.309 --> 03:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
what if the statute were changed so that
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
you extended the distance between the
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
necessary uh posting of the name
 
03:06:46.230 --> 03:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
and were allowed to purple paint say for
 
03:06:49.590 --> 03:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
200 yards or 300 yards and then you had
 
03:06:51.269 --> 03:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
a sign with the name so that someone
 
03:06:51.279 --> 03:06:52.469 align:start position:0%
a sign with the name so that someone
could

03:06:52.469 --> 03:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
take the time and walk a little bit
 
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
further and find the person's name yet
 
03:06:57.670 --> 03:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
save the homeowner the burden of having
 
03:07:01.030 --> 03:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
to put signs every so often as it is now
 
03:07:03.190 --> 03:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
how how would you see that
 
03:07:04.630 --> 03:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
i i guess
 
03:07:06.790 --> 03:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
the way i i mean i certainly open to
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
consider i guess my point though in
 
03:07:11.110 --> 03:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
coming here today was that the current
 
03:07:11.120 --> 03:07:12.150 align:start position:0%
coming here today was that the current
process

03:07:12.150 --> 03:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
works um
 
03:07:16.389 --> 03:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
again it's been established
 
03:07:18.790 --> 03:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
over many many many years people know
 
03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
what what the requirements are
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
and if it if it ain't broke why try to
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
fix it it's kind of our
 
03:07:27.990 --> 03:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
our approach to this
 
03:07:30.469 --> 03:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:33.190 --> 03:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
03:07:34.790 --> 03:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes one of the things i'm curious about
 
03:07:37.670 --> 03:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
is we've heard a lot of talk today about
 
03:07:39.269 --> 03:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
what's required of people who want to
 
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
post their land and the idea that people
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know that contact information is a
 
03:07:47.030 --> 03:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
good thing to have and it's necessary
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
and it helps people out
 
03:07:51.349 --> 03:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
i i think i can understand what i'm
 
03:07:52.870 --> 03:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
curious about though is it sounds like
 
03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
the vast majority in private private
 
03:07:57.510 --> 03:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
land in new hampshire is not posted
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
so in a situation where land is not
 
03:07:59.600 --> 03:08:01.190 align:start position:0%
so in a situation where land is not
posted

03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
posted
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
how do you get in touch with somebody if
 
03:08:06.150 --> 03:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
you have you know a fire protection
 
03:08:08.550 --> 03:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
issue or one of these other issues
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
where you find it helpful to have
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
information about the landowner
 
03:08:13.439 --> 03:08:14.710 align:start position:0%
information about the landowner
sure

03:08:14.710 --> 03:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:08:16.630 --> 03:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
great question and thank you for thank
 
03:08:19.349 --> 03:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
you for asking i think what we're what
 
03:08:22.710 --> 03:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is is slightly
 
03:08:25.510 --> 03:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
slightly different in the sense that
 
03:08:27.670 --> 03:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
when you post a piece of property
 
03:08:30.790 --> 03:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
you can't access that property
 
03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
you can't access that property without
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
permission if the property is not posted
 
03:08:37.359 --> 03:08:38.790 align:start position:0%
permission if the property is not posted
and

03:08:38.790 --> 03:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
and you need to access that property
 
03:08:44.870 --> 03:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
you can particularly if it's a situation
 
03:08:47.349 --> 03:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
where you need to access it and there's
 
03:08:50.070 --> 03:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
a time time factor there you've got a
 
03:08:53.429 --> 03:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
game animal you've got a fire situation
 
03:08:55.349 --> 03:08:55.359 align:start position:0%
um and in that instance
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's no question you can access it if
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's not posted
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is if this
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
darn speaker if it is posted
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
all right before i
 
03:09:09.110 --> 03:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
can do what i need to do follow the
 
03:09:12.950 --> 03:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
animal or deal with the fire situation i
 
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
the posting adds a step
 
03:09:16.710 --> 03:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
so the point is
 
03:09:18.870 --> 03:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
if you're not posted you don't have that
 
03:09:21.910 --> 03:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
that step in there once you post it
 
03:09:24.070 --> 03:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
now you have this landowner notification
 
03:09:26.790 --> 03:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
step and for that reason having the name
 
03:09:32.950 --> 03:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:32.960 --> 03:09:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:09:34.469 --> 03:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:36.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
coming

03:09:36.790 --> 03:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
coming
 
03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.990 --> 03:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
to go back to
 
03:09:44.309 --> 03:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know the posted signs it's it's
 
03:09:45.750 --> 03:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
obvious that it's
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
a wooden well most people put them on
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
plywood and then nail them up
 
03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
plywood and then nail them up
but

03:09:51.510 --> 03:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:09:54.229 --> 03:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
would it be easier
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
for somebody that wants to break the law
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
and to say hey i'm going to post all
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
this property even though i don't own it
 
03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
with a wooden sign or with just a spray
 
03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:07.030 align:start position:0%
with a wooden sign or with just a spray
paint

03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
paint
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
obviously i think splashing paint is
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
easier than going through the effort of
 
03:10:14.229 --> 03:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
creating a wooden sign and putting it up
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
on be it a tree or pole so my answer
 
03:10:21.110 --> 03:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
would be i think my opinion
 
03:10:24.229 --> 03:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
the paint would be easier to to apply
 
03:10:24.239 --> 03:10:25.190 align:start position:0%
the paint would be easier to to apply
than

03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:10:27.590 --> 03:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
posting a sign as you had said on a
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
piece of plywood onto a tree
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
most of the postings that i see
 
03:10:34.870 --> 03:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
typically don't use plywood
 
03:10:37.429 --> 03:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
but even so um
 
03:10:39.190 --> 03:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know the the paint would be i think
 
03:10:40.950 --> 03:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
the paint would be easier but you heard
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
testimony i haven't done i haven't done
 
03:10:45.269 --> 03:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
either i own land it's open to
 
03:10:48.070 --> 03:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
recreation i encourage people to use it
 
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
so i i can't tell you from personal
 
03:10:49.760 --> 03:10:51.269 align:start position:0%
so i i can't tell you from personal
experience

03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:10:54.469 --> 03:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
03:10:57.990 --> 03:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:10:59.429 --> 03:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
um is uh
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
are nails and trees a problem
 
03:11:07.190 --> 03:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
for the companies that are harvesting
 
03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:09.269 align:start position:0%
for the companies that are harvesting
trees

03:11:09.269 --> 03:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
trees
 
03:11:11.990 --> 03:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
nails yes nails are nails are problems
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
in trees you talk to any lumbermen
 
03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
and well you go into any lumberman's
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
office and they usually have a little
 
03:11:20.309 --> 03:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
bookshelf with all the little
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
things they find in in trees when they
 
03:11:24.550 --> 03:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
when they open them up and saw them
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
um but as you heard earlier there are
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
ways around that using
 
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
aluminum nails which are softer than
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
steel saw blades are made of steel there
 
03:11:36.150 --> 03:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
are other types of nails

thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
the committee calls major walsh new
 
03:12:08.710 --> 03:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
03:12:11.110 --> 03:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
my name is dave walsh i'm the assistant
 
03:12:13.830 --> 03:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
chief of law enforcement for the new
 
03:12:17.670 --> 03:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
first i would contend that probably
 
03:12:20.630 --> 03:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
nobody deals with posted land and posted
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
land issues more than a conservation
 
03:12:23.830 --> 03:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
officer with fish and game the other
 
03:12:25.590 --> 03:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
thing i think that i hope you would all
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
agree is outdoor recreation is a huge
 
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
part of new hampshire's economy and it's
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
a huge part of new hampshire's way of
 
03:12:30.720 --> 03:12:31.510 align:start position:0%
a huge part of new hampshire's way of
life

03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
the first thing i did when this bill
 
03:12:34.229 --> 03:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
came out is i called the state of maine
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
they implemented the purple paint law in
 
03:12:37.990 --> 03:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
2011 and i called the maine wooden
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
service and asked how is the purple
 
03:12:41.349 --> 03:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
paint log going and they laughed and
 
03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
they said utter chaos
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
they find more hunters and hikers on
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
purple painted land
 
03:12:49.349 --> 03:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
because they have no idea what it means
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
and that's been in place now for 10
 
03:12:54.309 --> 03:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of the points that i'll make i'll
 
03:12:57.269 --> 03:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
keep short because they've been brought
 
03:12:59.110 --> 03:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
up again but if a landowner
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
sells land which happens a lot in the
 
03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
sells land which happens a lot in the
state

03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:13:03.269 --> 03:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
and let's say it's 200 acres and it's
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
painted purple and the new owner comes
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
in and they want to keep that land open
 
03:13:08.309 --> 03:13:08.319 align:start position:0%
to outdoor recreation that's a lot of
 
03:13:09.910 --> 03:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
work to either scrape the bark or go
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
around with brown paint and cover it up
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
and to someone's point earlier
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
many of those landowners might not do
 
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
that effort so they don't want to post
 
03:13:19.429 --> 03:13:19.439 align:start position:0%
their land but now we have unintended
 
03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
posted land because they don't want to
 
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
go through that effort an unintended
 
03:13:24.790 --> 03:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
posted land is not what we need in the
 
03:13:26.309 --> 03:13:26.319 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:13:27.750 --> 03:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing is if a landowner
 
03:13:29.190 --> 03:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
changes their mind let's say they post
 
03:13:31.030 --> 03:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
their land with purple paint
 
03:13:32.790 --> 03:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
and then they decide they want to have
 
03:13:34.229 --> 03:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
some current use some land in current
 
03:13:36.229 --> 03:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
use and change the allowable uses on the
 
03:13:38.389 --> 03:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
land outdoor recreation now they got to
 
03:13:40.070 --> 03:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
go through that f again or many
 
03:13:41.750 --> 03:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
landowners will allow certain things
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
they might allow hiking but not hunting
 
03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:45.750 align:start position:0%
they might allow hiking but not hunting
so

03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:13:46.710 --> 03:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
now they're going to have to go through
 
03:13:48.229 --> 03:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
this the purple and if they've already
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
had purple paint in their land leave
 
03:13:50.870 --> 03:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
they have to cover up that purple paint
 
03:13:53.349 --> 03:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
or put a sign on it or next to it and
 
03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
now if you have purple paint next to a
 
03:13:54.800 --> 03:13:55.590 align:start position:0%
now if you have purple paint next to a
sign

03:13:55.590 --> 03:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
sign
 
03:13:58.150 --> 03:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
what came first and it's just confusion
 
03:13:59.830 --> 03:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
to people
 
03:14:02.070 --> 03:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
as as a previous speaker said the system
 
03:14:04.870 --> 03:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
works the way it is and it's it's uh
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's nothing that we we could own
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative conley thank you
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
03:14:19.110 --> 03:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
we've heard from landowners who say the
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
system is not working
 
03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
um and we have two in the room and i
 
03:14:24.630 --> 03:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
suspect there's many more across the
 
03:14:25.990 --> 03:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
state who would
 
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
would love to not have to deface their
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
trees and their property and walk the
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
perimeter and so forth so
 
03:14:31.680 --> 03:14:33.510 align:start position:0%
perimeter and so forth so
um

03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:35.750 --> 03:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd ask you the same question
 
03:14:40.710 --> 03:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
is there harm in giving them a choice
 
03:14:42.309 --> 03:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
in the means that they would they would
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
mark their property
 
03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
which would be their right as a property
 
03:14:47.110 --> 03:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
owner sure so i've been doing this for
 
03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
24 years and i can tell you the vast
 
03:14:51.030 --> 03:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
majority of people that do post alien to
 
03:14:53.190 --> 03:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
use tyvek paper with staple gun or
 
03:14:55.269 --> 03:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
aluminum nails so the tree issue isn't
 
03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:02.469 --> 03:15:02.479 align:start position:0%
i i agree with representative roy that
 
03:15:04.150 --> 03:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
there could be some room to add some
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
signage with purple paint but if it's
 
03:15:07.510 --> 03:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
just paint
 
03:15:11.190 --> 03:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
all i see is confusion and
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:40.630 --> 03:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:42.710 --> 03:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
so i've just been listening here and i
 
03:15:44.469 --> 03:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
actually did quite a bit of research
 
03:15:46.469 --> 03:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
into this because i'm one of these
 
03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
people that had difficulty posting my
 
03:15:50.710 --> 03:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
land i'm not quite as
 
03:15:53.030 --> 03:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
short and skinny as this woman before me
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
but close
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
and it did take a ladder
 
03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i did have to go around the year
 
03:16:01.429 --> 03:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
later and i saw that all my tyvek signs
 
03:16:03.190 --> 03:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
had folded in so i
 
03:16:05.190 --> 03:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
invested in better plastic signs which
 
03:16:07.429 --> 03:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
cost me a lot and went back and did all
 
03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
my labor again
 
03:16:12.070 --> 03:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
but what i wanted to say mostly is that
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is about landowner rights and
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the practice is spreading throughout the
 
03:16:19.590 --> 03:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
country and i think for the same reasons
 
03:16:22.150 --> 03:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
we want it here the rest of the country
 
03:16:24.389 --> 03:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
is finding that they need it as well and
 
03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
we've got more than half the states now
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
with either laws or legislation that
 
03:16:30.389 --> 03:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
they're considering
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
and that includes in in the northeast
 
03:16:35.190 --> 03:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
we've got maine which was mentioned
 
03:16:38.229 --> 03:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania and both
 
03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
new york and vermont currently have
 
03:16:42.150 --> 03:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that they're considering to
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
add the purple paint law as well
 
03:16:44.479 --> 03:16:45.429 align:start position:0%
add the purple paint law as well
um

03:16:45.429 --> 03:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:47.190 --> 03:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a change there's some
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
public public education that needs to
 
03:16:49.359 --> 03:16:50.229 align:start position:0%
public public education that needs to
happen

03:16:50.229 --> 03:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
and um in searching i saw that the
 
03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
local news and the newspapers would
 
03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
cover you know if if the law passed they
 
03:16:59.429 --> 03:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
would they'd have a little spot on the
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
news that said you can now you know post
 
03:17:03.190 --> 03:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
your property with purple paint in
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania or whatever it was and the
 
03:17:06.790 --> 03:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
newspapers cover it and i think new
 
03:17:08.309 --> 03:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire fish and game is extremely
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
good at public education and they could
 
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
the paint itself
 
03:17:26.469 --> 03:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
you can buy it from rust-oleum you can
 
03:17:28.389 --> 03:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
buy it from krylon there's another
 
03:17:30.550 --> 03:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
company called magic that makes it so
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's widely available in lowe's home
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
depot it's it's a thing and and people
 
03:17:37.429 --> 03:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
will get used to it and they'll see it
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
they'll start to learn what it means and
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
they'll see they'll read things when
 
03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
they hear from fish and game what it
 
03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
and i think that's
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
all i have to say
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%

03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:16.469 --> 03:18:16.479 align:start position:0%

gotten when somebody gets a license
 
03:18:33.269 --> 03:18:33.279 align:start position:0%
if in fact they do
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
could this type of education be
 
03:18:39.590 --> 03:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
handed out when the license is is given
 
03:18:41.990 --> 03:18:42.000 align:start position:0%

house bill 1433
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh you may remember me from last year
 
04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
when i came
 
04:17:08.960 --> 04:17:09.990 align:start position:0%

introduce house bill 3 um 338
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
that bill was
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
a related topic it dealt with
 
04:17:21.349 --> 04:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
dog collars
 
04:17:21.359 --> 04:17:23.269 align:start position:0%
dog collars
and

04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:25.269 --> 04:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
it's sort of relevant to this bill as
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
well because i wouldn't be here if it
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.990 --> 04:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
basically house bill 338 last year

there was
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
a concern raised
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
by the co-chairs of the governor's

and removing microchips the concern
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
really didn't deal with
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
either of those issues it dealt with
 
04:18:22.399 --> 04:18:24.389 align:start position:0%

house bill 1433
 
04:19:08.319 --> 04:19:09.269 align:start position:0%
house bill 1433

04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
seeks to do three things
 
04:19:11.359 --> 04:19:12.389 align:start position:0%
seeks to do three things
first

04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:20.229 --> 04:19:20.239 align:start position:0%

code under cruelty to animals
 
04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
it also seeks to repeal the section of
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 466
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%

that deals with the poisoning of dogs
 
04:19:35.590 --> 04:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
it further repeals rsa

04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%

it is primarily a housekeeping bill
 
04:19:47.840 --> 04:19:48.870 align:start position:0%
it is primarily a housekeeping bill
um

04:19:48.870 --> 04:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
and essentially puts the poisoning of
 
04:19:52.319 --> 04:19:53.349 align:start position:0%
and essentially puts the poisoning of
dogs

04:19:53.349 --> 04:19:53.359 align:start position:0%

04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%

04:20:09.670 --> 04:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
is also here to testify she was the
 
04:20:11.670 --> 04:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
motivator behind
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
and can go into
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
more detail as to why they sought to
 
04:20:20.469 --> 04:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
my pleasure to
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
bring this bill on their behalf
 
04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
and they're a joy to work with with that
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're recognized
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:20:37.750 --> 04:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
and it has to do with the uh on page two
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
lines four the the removal uh it lists
 
04:20:45.510 --> 04:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
what's uh
 
04:20:45.520 --> 04:20:47.429 align:start position:0%
what's uh
repealed

04:20:47.429 --> 04:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
04:20:50.550 --> 04:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
and my confusion is what when stuff is
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
bolded and not bolded and when it's in
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
the real with the current law or is it a
 
04:20:57.750 --> 04:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
new new stuff that is just not bolded
 
04:20:58.950 --> 04:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
04:21:00.790 --> 04:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
and if someone else you think might have
 
04:21:02.389 --> 04:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
better knowledge to talk about that i'd
 
04:21:04.229 --> 04:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
be happy to wait until someone else is
 
04:21:04.239 --> 04:21:05.189 align:start position:0%
be happy to wait until someone else is
there

04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
the bill as printed is a little bit uh
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit difficult to decipher
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
on the first page um you will see the
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
the bold uh printed material um and that
 
04:21:19.510 --> 04:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
is indeed the new uh section on on
 
04:21:21.510 --> 04:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
poisoning of animals not necessarily
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
just dogs but poisoning of animals um
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
then on the
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
at the very end on page two um it very
 
04:21:30.870 --> 04:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
briefly um indicates that it would
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
repeal rsa 64416
 
04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
relating to the exposing poisons to
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%

representative conley

thank you if i may piggyback on my
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
colleague from nashua's comment so uh
 
04:22:13.830 --> 04:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think dover
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
residents are least proud of is we've
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
had a problem with rats a lot of
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
development a lot of rats and people are
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
taking it upon themselves
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
to place poison out in the neighborhood
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth and i'm wondering about
 
04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
that last
 
04:22:28.389 --> 04:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
section that you just described
 
04:22:30.870 --> 04:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
what sort of intent would be required to
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
be caught up in this if
 
04:22:35.030 --> 04:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
an animal were to ingest the substance
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
that was placed
 
04:22:41.110 --> 04:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
around one's property but
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
had an effect on an animal other than a
 
04:22:42.800 --> 04:22:44.389 align:start position:0%
had an effect on an animal other than a
rat

04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
rat
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
as i understand it if you intentionally
 
04:22:48.550 --> 04:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
poison um
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh the types of animals covered by this
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
which would be um
 
04:22:56.149 --> 04:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh domestic animals um or
 
04:22:59.830 --> 04:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
wildlife in captivity
 
04:23:02.710 --> 04:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
it would be probably deemed a negligent
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
act i'm sorry if you intentionally do it
 
04:23:07.189 --> 04:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
it would be um
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
a higher uh penalty than if you um
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
do something by accident um negligence
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
um i believe is a misdemeanor um the
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
intentional poisoning of an animal um
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative rory
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
um i hire actually an
 
04:23:34.469 --> 04:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
extermination company i live out in the
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
woods and we get field mice and they
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
come and they put these bait traps
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
around the foundation of my house
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
now if my neighbor's dog comes over and
 
04:23:43.830 --> 04:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
chews through one of those needs to
 
04:23:46.389 --> 04:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
poison would i fall under the negligent
 
04:23:47.910 --> 04:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
poisoning of an animal in the statute or
 
04:23:47.920 --> 04:23:51.189 align:start position:0%
poisoning of an animal in the statute or
no

04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not law enforcement um so i'm not
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how that would be treated
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
but i would say there is potential for
 
04:23:57.279 --> 04:23:57.990 align:start position:0%
but i would say there is potential for
that

04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
representative splain
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
much like mr roy i live out in the
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
middle of nowhere and my closest
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
neighbors a quarter mile plus away
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon that i find the
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
neighbor's dog in my yard especially
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
since i also have a dog
 
04:24:19.920 --> 04:24:21.110 align:start position:0%
since i also have a dog
and

04:24:21.110 --> 04:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:24.229 --> 04:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
i am frequently putting out poison for
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
mice around the foundation of my house
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
and or in my garage
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
should their dog decide to eat my poison
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
for the mice even if it's in a
 
04:24:34.950 --> 04:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
controlled box
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
why should i be liable for their dog
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
coming on my property
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
a quarter mile away when there's leash
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
laws in the town
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything in here that that
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
basically says if you're on your own
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
property and you're poisoning on your
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
own property that there's no
 
04:24:57.030 --> 04:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:58.389 --> 04:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
i think you're right
 
04:24:59.670 --> 04:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:25:01.429 --> 04:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
basically law enforcement would have to
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether or not that dog being
 
04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
on your property that far away from
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
their place not on a leash
 
04:25:10.149 --> 04:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
might be a mitigating circumstance but
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
again i'm not law enforcement
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for follow-up
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
if we purposefully put into law
 
04:25:21.030 --> 04:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
something that makes somebody
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
liable for that type of behavior
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
and then we say it's up on law
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement to mitigate that
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's an injustice to everyone in this
 
04:25:31.520 --> 04:25:32.389 align:start position:0%
that's an injustice to everyone in this
state

04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
we need to ensure that our laws are
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
correct before we enact them
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
poisoning of animals is currently
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
in the law what this bill intends to do
 
04:25:49.510 --> 04:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
is to move it from from one part of the
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
law to another so it's more easily
 
04:25:51.199 --> 04:25:52.710 align:start position:0%
law to another so it's more easily
identified

04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
identified
 
04:25:57.830 --> 04:25:57.840 align:start position:0%

representative bert
 
04:26:01.110 --> 04:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i do have a
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
question for the uh representative but
 
04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
if you wouldn't mind if i have a
 
04:26:08.469 --> 04:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
question for you first mr chairman
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
um you recognized for a parliamentary
 
04:26:12.309 --> 04:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
inquiry all right thank you
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
if if i'm reading
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
first page
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
line 15 to 19
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
i'm reading it as if i put poison out
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh to protect my building or crops that
 
04:26:30.309 --> 04:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
i am not going to i'm exempt if a dog
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
comes onto my property am i reading that
 
04:26:32.399 --> 04:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
comes onto my property am i reading that
wrong

04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me i interpreted this and this is
 
04:26:48.149 --> 04:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
my interpretation which i i'm not
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
testifying i'll just point that out
 
04:26:51.910 --> 04:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's not really a parliamentary inquiry
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
might i have
 
04:26:53.040 --> 04:26:55.510 align:start position:0%
might i have
but

04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to be have an exception if you
 
04:27:00.229 --> 04:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
put out some type of poison control to
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
deal with rats or other type of
 
04:27:02.960 --> 04:27:04.309 align:start position:0%
deal with rats or other type of
vermin

04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
vermin
 
04:27:04.319 --> 04:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
vermin
so

04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
it allows an exception for that
 
04:27:09.030 --> 04:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
i i would just tell any member of the
 
04:27:11.349 --> 04:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
committee while well since i'm answering
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:27:14.229 --> 04:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
and since we all just got our updated
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
books recently i know that some subs but
 
04:27:20.309 --> 04:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at rsa 626 colon 2
 
04:27:22.389 --> 04:27:22.399 align:start position:0%

is the definition of

is the definition of

negligently
 
04:27:27.670 --> 04:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
which may also
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
help understand the application of this
 
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
if it were to become law
 
04:27:35.189 --> 04:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
so that's a person acts negligibly with
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
respect to a material element of an
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
offense when he fails to become aware of
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
a substantial risk and unjustifiable
 
04:27:41.439 --> 04:27:42.550 align:start position:0%
a substantial risk and unjustifiable
risk

04:27:42.550 --> 04:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
risk
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
that the material element exists or will
 
04:27:47.110 --> 04:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
result from his conduct risk must be of
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
such a nature and degree that his
 
04:27:52.149 --> 04:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
failure to become aware of its
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
constitutes a gross deviation from the
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
conduct that a reasonable person would
 
04:27:58.790 --> 04:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
observe in that situation
 
04:28:01.510 --> 04:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
so that's just from an application
 
04:28:01.520 --> 04:28:02.550 align:start position:0%
so that's just from an application
yes

04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
and if i may ask the you may you may ask
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
the witness a question okay thank you mr
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you uh for clearing
 
04:28:09.990 --> 04:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
that up
 
04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:18.630 --> 04:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
i think i'm a little confused too like
 
04:28:21.510 --> 04:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know the first speaker about what is
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
changes and i'm looking at lines 25 and
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
26 and then also 27 through 30
 
04:28:28.080 --> 04:28:28.950 align:start position:0%
26 and then also 27 through 30
is

04:28:28.950 --> 04:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:28:31.030 --> 04:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
what is not bolded
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
is that current law
 
04:28:37.030 --> 04:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes all right so what is what
 
04:28:37.040 --> 04:28:39.269 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes all right so what is what
follow-ups

04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
follow-ups
 
04:28:41.349 --> 04:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up thank you
 
04:28:44.550 --> 04:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman and so it's just the
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
words being added and i was also looking
 
04:28:51.429 --> 04:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
at line two which is currently if
 
04:28:53.349 --> 04:28:53.359 align:start position:0%
somebody is found guilty
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
of and this is current law if i'm
 
04:28:57.990 --> 04:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly if somebody
 
04:29:01.349 --> 04:29:01.359 align:start position:0%
poisons an animal um it's a misdemeanor
 
04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
first then second offense would go to a
 
04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
felony charge
 
04:29:06.550 --> 04:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
that is the current law yes okay that's
 
04:29:11.110 --> 04:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so we're not adding anything
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
the only things that uh have changed in
 
04:29:18.149 --> 04:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
rsa 644 colon eight 8
 
04:29:18.159 --> 04:29:19.110 align:start position:0%
rsa 644 colon eight 8
is

04:29:19.110 --> 04:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:29:20.710 --> 04:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
what is bold
 
04:29:22.550 --> 04:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate you clearing that
 
04:29:22.560 --> 04:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate you clearing that
up

04:29:25.510 --> 04:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:27.510 --> 04:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative plain
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chair and thank you
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:29:34.870 --> 04:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
my further question comes from the
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
specificity of
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh and persons using poison to control
 
04:29:41.110 --> 04:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
rats and other vermin in their building
 
04:29:43.590 --> 04:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
or to protect their crops
 
04:29:45.429 --> 04:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
i raise chickens
 
04:29:47.910 --> 04:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
and i frequently put out poison in the
 
04:29:51.110 --> 04:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
chicken coop or around the chicken coop
 
04:29:53.349 --> 04:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
to prevent rats and vermin from going
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
into the chicken coop to either steal
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
the chicken
 
04:29:56.640 --> 04:29:57.750 align:start position:0%
the chicken
feed

04:29:57.750 --> 04:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
feed
 
04:30:00.149 --> 04:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
or to go after the eggs from the
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
chickens which they will do
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here to protecting
 
04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
livestock protecting
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
the value of your your reap from your
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
livestock and or crops it only deals
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
with crops and buildings representatives
 
04:30:17.030 --> 04:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
plain is there is there a question
 
04:30:17.040 --> 04:30:17.990 align:start position:0%
plain is there is there a question
yeah

04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
is there it does this apply
 
04:30:22.149 --> 04:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
also to
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.750 --> 04:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i think i would defer to the next
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
witness on that
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
um she's far more familiar with the
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%

04:31:05.590 --> 04:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
from the governor's
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%

04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind just spelling your
 
04:31:24.469 --> 04:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.110 --> 04:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:03.429 --> 04:32:03.439 align:start position:0%

04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
the humane treatment of animals
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
on the commission i represent the
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%

we the governor's commission
um

04:32:20.070 --> 04:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
looks at
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
any new legislation coming through
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
to see if and how it affects the welfare
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
of animals
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
and every legislative session we go
 
04:32:31.600 --> 04:32:32.830 align:start position:0%
and every legislative session we go
through

04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:32:32.840 --> 04:32:34.469 align:start position:0%
through
basically

04:32:34.469 --> 04:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:32:34.479 --> 04:32:36.229 align:start position:0%
basically
any

04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:32:36.239 --> 04:32:38.309 align:start position:0%
any
new

04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:32:40.630 --> 04:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
bill that may have the word animals in
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
it to see if it's going to affect
 
04:32:45.189 --> 04:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
the humane treatment of animals
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
as representative sullivan indicated
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
we had an issue last year with the bill
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
that was primarily for
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
tracking callers and microchips but we
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
found an issue with the poisoning of
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
animals and we also were aware of
 
04:33:03.600 --> 04:33:04.551 align:start position:0%
animals and we also were aware of
another

04:33:04.551 --> 04:33:04.561 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
um statute that was in the wrong place
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
as far as where it was in the criminal
 
04:33:09.760 --> 04:33:11.109 align:start position:0%
as far as where it was in the criminal
code

04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
code
 
04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:33:12.639 --> 04:33:13.510 align:start position:0%
so um
we

04:33:13.510 --> 04:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
as he mentioned he gave you the history
 
04:33:17.189 --> 04:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
of it so i'm not going to go over that
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
again but i would like to
 
04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
what's actually going on here and talk
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
about the pieces of the puzzle
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:30.561 --> 04:33:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:31.920 --> 04:33:33.029 align:start position:0%
that
has

04:33:33.029 --> 04:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:33:33.039 --> 04:33:34.310 align:start position:0%
has
the

04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
beginning of the animal cruelty act
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:45.189 --> 04:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
the definition for animal cruelty is
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
very broad
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and the poisoning of animals would
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
definitely come under that category
 
04:33:52.480 --> 04:33:53.429 align:start position:0%
definitely come under that category
um

04:33:53.429 --> 04:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:56.709 --> 04:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:58.551 --> 04:33:58.561 align:start position:0%
gives a list it says cruelty shall
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
include but not be
 
04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
and then goes on from there
 
04:34:05.990 --> 04:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
it also defines animal
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
and these are very important definitions
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
in that law
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
in the 644 644-8 in the animal cruelty
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
law an animal is a domestic animal a
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
household pet or a wild animal in
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
captivity it's not a free living animal
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's not um wildlife
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
um it's much more than dogs just dogs
 
04:34:29.109 --> 04:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
which is what was in the bill that was
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
passed last year
 
04:34:31.520 --> 04:34:33.429 align:start position:0%
passed last year
okay

04:34:33.429 --> 04:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
now if you go to the actual bill
 
04:34:43.029 --> 04:34:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
this goes on and goes down to roman
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
numeral three so
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
you've got roman numeral one in front of
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
you on the blue sheet we're going to
 
04:34:53.990 --> 04:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
skip down to three because that's where
 
04:34:56.390 --> 04:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
the germain actions are
 
04:34:59.429 --> 04:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
and it talks about
 
04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
a person is guilty of a misdemeanor for
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
a first offense and of a class b felony
 
04:35:06.390 --> 04:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
for a second a subsequent offense and
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
then it gives you a grocery list
 
04:35:08.799 --> 04:35:09.590 align:start position:0%
then it gives you a grocery list
of

04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
actions that somebody can take
 
04:35:14.789 --> 04:35:14.799 align:start position:0%
that constitute cruelty
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
and you notice they all begin with the
 
04:35:16.959 --> 04:35:18.789 align:start position:0%
and you notice they all begin with the
word

04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
word
 
04:35:22.230 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
negligence negligently and
 
04:35:25.349 --> 04:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative abbas brought up the fact
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
that there are culpable mental
 
04:35:28.400 --> 04:35:30.150 align:start position:0%
that there are culpable mental
culpable

04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
culpable
 
04:35:32.629 --> 04:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
mental states
 
04:35:35.590 --> 04:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
for each offense in the criminal code
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
there has to be a reason
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
for that happening so the first part of
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
the cruelty law
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
talks about negligent actions and
 
04:35:46.709 --> 04:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of them some of
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
them are very old terminology
 
04:35:50.480 --> 04:35:51.429 align:start position:0%
them are very old terminology
but

04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
an example is
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
without lawful authority negligently
 
04:35:57.670 --> 04:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
deprived or causes to be private any
 
04:35:59.670 --> 04:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
animal in its possession or custody
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
necessary care sustenance or shelter so
 
04:36:03.670 --> 04:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's an example
 
04:36:05.830 --> 04:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
so we're proposing to put
 
04:36:08.310 --> 04:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
poisoning in this list
 
04:36:11.269 --> 04:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
okay of the negligent offenses
 
04:36:13.029 --> 04:36:13.039 align:start position:0%
and i'll talk specifically about the
 
04:36:15.429 --> 04:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
language for that in a minute
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 3 a
 
04:36:28.470 --> 04:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
we have another set of offenses to the
 
04:36:30.150 --> 04:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
cruelty law
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
and these offenses are
 
04:36:35.189 --> 04:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
have a higher penalty right off the bat
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's a class b felony
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
and that is for
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who purposely
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
commit an action against this law and
 
04:36:45.750 --> 04:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
04:36:49.590 --> 04:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
little grocery list of just five items
 
04:36:52.390 --> 04:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
beats cruelly whips tortures
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
mutilates any animal or causes an animal
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be beaten cruelly whipped tortured or
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
mutilated and we'd like to add poisoning
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
to that list
 
04:37:04.949 --> 04:37:04.959 align:start position:0%
okay so those are the basic changes we'd
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
like to make in the cruelty law
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
we feel that poisoning belongs in this
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
list and nowhere else in the
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
um statutes
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
now on the
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
back of the first sheet that i gave you
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have copies of the
 
04:37:26.551 --> 04:37:26.561 align:start position:0%
laws that we're going to be
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
repealing so you can understand
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
why we had an issue with that
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
now the first law
 
04:37:38.230 --> 04:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
is in the civil code it's under the
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
chapter 466 which covers dogs and cats
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
under the auspices of the department of
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture markets and food
 
04:37:48.160 --> 04:37:50.390 align:start position:0%
agriculture markets and food
so

04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:50.400 --> 04:37:51.429 align:start position:0%
so
it

04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
just the second
 
04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph their stealing dogs and
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
tampering with callers is the bill
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%
that representative sullivan talked
 
04:38:01.990 --> 04:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:38:04.070 --> 04:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
was passed last year
 
04:38:04.080 --> 04:38:05.189 align:start position:0%
was passed last year
okay

04:38:05.189 --> 04:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:05.199 --> 04:38:05.990 align:start position:0%
okay
and

04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:13.750 --> 04:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:38:16.150 --> 04:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
whoever distributes or exposes a
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
poisonous substance with the intent that
 
04:38:21.029 --> 04:38:21.039 align:start position:0%
the same shall be eaten by any dog shall
 
04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
be liable to the owner of the dog's
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
owner for its value and shall be guilty
 
04:38:29.349 --> 04:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.359 --> 04:38:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
so first of all it's just dogs no other
 
04:38:33.359 --> 04:38:35.750 align:start position:0%
so first of all it's just dogs no other
animals

04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
animals
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
and it just talks about the fact that it
 
04:38:38.959 --> 04:38:42.629 align:start position:0%
and it just talks about the fact that it
is

04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
does not address a culpable mental state
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's not in there at all which is what
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
we need for a crime
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
it has only one penalty
 
04:38:54.949 --> 04:38:54.959 align:start position:0%
class b felony
 
04:38:57.269 --> 04:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
and it only talks about ingestion of a
 
04:38:57.279 --> 04:38:58.551 align:start position:0%
and it only talks about ingestion of a
poison

04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
poison
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
poison going in by mouth for the most
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
part okay
 
04:39:03.279 --> 04:39:04.869 align:start position:0%
part okay
so

04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission feels that
 
04:39:09.029 --> 04:39:09.039 align:start position:0%
this should not be in the civil code it
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
should be part
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the criminal code and part of the
 
04:39:16.230 --> 04:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
um animal cruelty law
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay if you go down and look at
 
04:39:22.230 --> 04:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
another statute that's in the criminal
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
code 644-16
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
this is an old law
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's in there but it's not in the
 
04:39:30.320 --> 04:39:31.830 align:start position:0%
that's in there but it's not in the
section

04:39:31.830 --> 04:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
where the animal related crimes are it's
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
someplace else off by itself
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
and it's called exposing poisons
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
and it's if any person shall in any way
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
or place purposely expose an active
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
poison or deadly substance for the
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
destruction of any animal
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
or for any other purpose except the
 
04:39:55.830 --> 04:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
destruction of rats other vermin in his
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
own building or upon his crops he shall
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
be guilty of a violation
 
04:40:04.070 --> 04:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay so that's there
 
04:40:04.080 --> 04:40:05.670 align:start position:0%
okay so that's there
um

04:40:05.670 --> 04:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
it only talks about exposing poisons and
 
04:40:12.628 --> 04:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
the penalty is only a violation which as
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know is a fine
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
and again the governor's commission felt
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
that that was not appropriate
 
04:40:21.430 --> 04:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
and that it should be
 
04:40:24.150 --> 04:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
um moved up to
 
04:40:24.160 --> 04:40:25.270 align:start position:0%
um moved up to
the

04:40:25.270 --> 04:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty statute which is 644.8
 
04:40:29.040 --> 04:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty statute which is 644.8
okay

04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:30.480 --> 04:40:33.670 align:start position:0%
okay
now

04:40:33.670 --> 04:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
we do feel
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
and hopefully you understand where this
 
04:40:40.470 --> 04:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
is coming from that a person
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
that purposely tries to poison
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
under the
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
cruelty statute which is domestic animal
 
04:40:56.708 --> 04:40:56.718 align:start position:0%
household pet
 
04:40:59.430 --> 04:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
or wildlife in captivity anybody that
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
purposely tries to poison an animal
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
should be guilty of a felony offense
 
04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing that on purpose now it
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
does not cover
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
any wildlife doesn't cover mice rats
 
04:41:12.878 --> 04:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
any wildlife doesn't cover mice rats
whatever

04:41:13.990 --> 04:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:41:14.000 --> 04:41:15.510 align:start position:0%
whatever
um

04:41:15.510 --> 04:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
they are not covered under the animal
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
cruelty law
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay but somebody that's trying to
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
poison domestic animal household pet
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
or wildlife in captivity
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission feels that
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
that should be a felony offense
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
because it's intentional it's purposeful
 
04:41:38.948 --> 04:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
and it's meant to harm the animal
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
so if we go back and look at the actual
 
04:41:43.030 --> 04:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill again
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
i'd like to talk to
 
04:41:47.430 --> 04:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
what we did with the language
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the cruelty law
 
04:41:52.628 --> 04:41:52.638 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the bill i'm starting
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
with line 15
 
04:41:59.110 --> 04:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
and i'll talk through
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
what each of those parts of that
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
two sentences mean
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we're adding to the misdemeanor
 
04:42:09.590 --> 04:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
grocery list
 
04:42:09.600 --> 04:42:11.430 align:start position:0%
grocery list
that

04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor for first offense and
 
04:42:16.310 --> 04:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
a class b felony for a second or
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense who
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
negligently poisons an animal by
 
04:42:21.360 --> 04:42:22.708 align:start position:0%
negligently poisons an animal by
exposing

04:42:22.708 --> 04:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
exposing
 
04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
distributing or administering an active
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
poison or toxic substance
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
causing harm or death to the animal
 
04:42:32.080 --> 04:42:33.590 align:start position:0%
causing harm or death to the animal
okay

04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:35.590 --> 04:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
then we try to address some of the
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been brought up here
 
04:42:38.560 --> 04:42:39.670 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been brought up here
one

04:42:39.670 --> 04:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
and give give some exceptions
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
substances administered in accordance
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
with rsa 332 b
 
04:42:49.910 --> 04:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
this happens to be the veterinary
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
practice act
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
so that if somebody
 
04:42:56.070 --> 04:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
is administering a medication and the
 
04:42:58.868 --> 04:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
animal has a side effect
 
04:42:58.878 --> 04:43:00.230 align:start position:0%
animal has a side effect
that

04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
that the veterinarian is absolved from
 
04:43:05.670 --> 04:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
that because it's as you probably watch
 
04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
tv every drug has possible side effects
 
04:43:09.600 --> 04:43:10.868 align:start position:0%
tv every drug has possible side effects
okay

04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:13.190 --> 04:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then we also added
 
04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
the exclusion persons using poison to
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
control rats and other vermin
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
in either their building or to protect
 
04:43:23.430 --> 04:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
their crops shall be exempt from this
 
04:43:23.440 --> 04:43:25.110 align:start position:0%
their crops shall be exempt from this
subparagraph

04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
subparagraph
 
04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
that's a direct quote from the old law
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
hoping to repeal um the exposing poisons
 
04:43:35.670 --> 04:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
so that would absolve
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
your chicken coop on any of your
 
04:43:38.000 --> 04:43:39.270 align:start position:0%
your chicken coop on any of your
property

04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
um it would allow you to do that as long
 
04:43:42.320 --> 04:43:43.030 align:start position:0%
um it would allow you to do that as long
as

04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
you were um
 
04:43:46.708 --> 04:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
dealing with just vermin
 
04:43:47.990 --> 04:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
now um
 
04:43:49.990 --> 04:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
the definition of vermin by most
 
04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
dictionaries is any of various small
 
04:43:55.270 --> 04:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
animals or insects that are destructive
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
annoying or injurious to health
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
such as cockroaches and rats and so this
 
04:44:03.830 --> 04:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
allows exterminators and wildlife
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
nuisance wildlife operators to come in
 
04:44:08.628 --> 04:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
and protect your property
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
penalty for that
 
04:44:14.310 --> 04:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
now if a neighbor's dog gets in there
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's on them
 
04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know that's their problem it's your
 
04:44:18.160 --> 04:44:19.510 align:start position:0%
you know that's their problem it's your
property

04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
the animal is trespassing at that point
 
04:44:24.070 --> 04:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
and if they get poisoned um that's on
 
04:44:24.080 --> 04:44:25.590 align:start position:0%
and if they get poisoned um that's on
them

04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:44:27.880 --> 04:44:27.890 align:start position:0%
okay so that we put in the
 
04:44:27.890 --> 04:44:31.030 align:start position:0%
okay so that we put in the
[Music]

04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.310 --> 04:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
negligent category but we also repeated
 
04:44:34.320 --> 04:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
negligent category but we also repeated
it

04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:44:39.270 --> 04:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
down in the felony category
 
04:44:41.590 --> 04:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
now um
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
so it's repeated under the felony
 
04:44:47.350 --> 04:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:50.550 --> 04:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
okay so those same exceptions apply
 
04:44:50.560 --> 04:44:51.590 align:start position:0%
okay so those same exceptions apply
under

04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:44:51.600 --> 04:44:53.750 align:start position:0%
under
um

04:44:53.750 --> 04:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:53.760 --> 04:44:55.270 align:start position:0%
um
in

04:44:55.270 --> 04:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
after line 28 when we're talking about
 
04:45:04.708 --> 04:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:04.718 --> 04:45:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:45:06.560 --> 04:45:07.750 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:07.760 --> 04:45:08.550 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:45:08.550 --> 04:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:45:11.110 --> 04:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes three changes that
 
04:45:15.670 --> 04:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
and remove poorly written
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
felony offense from the civil law
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
and remove an outdated statute with an
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
inappropriate penalty so we're doing
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay so i hope i've clarified some of
 
04:45:40.150 --> 04:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:42.150 --> 04:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
representatives plain
 
04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:45:46.150 --> 04:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:45:48.708 --> 04:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
would you call polypropylene glycol a
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
toxic poison antifreeze yes so if i were
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
so if i was to have a spill of
 
04:46:01.990 --> 04:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
antifreeze polypropylene glycol in my
 
04:46:04.390 --> 04:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
driveway and the dog next door came over
 
04:46:06.230 --> 04:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
and licked it because it does taste
 
04:46:06.240 --> 04:46:07.190 align:start position:0%
and licked it because it does taste
sweet

04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
sweet
 
04:46:09.590 --> 04:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
and poisoned themselves would i then be
 
04:46:12.150 --> 04:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
eligible for potential prosecution under
 
04:46:13.910 --> 04:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
this law because i negligently did not
 
04:46:18.230 --> 04:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.628 --> 04:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
that's a good possibility depending on
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
how the investigation goes
 
04:46:24.878 --> 04:46:25.830 align:start position:0%
how the investigation goes
well

04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:46:25.840 --> 04:46:26.628 align:start position:0%
well
if

04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
can i continue for a minute
 
04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
a question
 
04:46:34.948 --> 04:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
if it's an inadvertent spill chances are
 
04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
there would not be an issue if you were
 
04:46:38.000 --> 04:46:39.830 align:start position:0%
there would not be an issue if you were
um

04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
working on your car and you knew there
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
was a spill
 
04:46:44.230 --> 04:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
there may be an issue if you didn't
 
04:46:45.590 --> 04:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
clean up
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
there are accidents that happen
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
you recognize for follow-up thank you mr
 
04:46:54.878 --> 04:46:56.230 align:start position:0%
you recognize for follow-up thank you mr
chair

04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
would you consider chocolate toxic to
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
animals dogs specifically
 
04:47:05.670 --> 04:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:47:10.070 --> 04:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
am i recognized for my follow-up yes
 
04:47:12.230 --> 04:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
last one
 
04:47:15.910 --> 04:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
we generally we want to
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
you asked the question now you you've
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
changed the stuff there are a number
 
04:47:22.470 --> 04:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
there are a number of issues mr chair
 
04:47:24.550 --> 04:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
that need to come out on this because
 
04:47:26.470 --> 04:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of toxic substances to
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
animals that
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
have been
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
now broadly categorized
 
04:47:33.590 --> 04:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
in a situation where
 
04:47:36.230 --> 04:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
very few people have control over them
 
04:47:38.230 --> 04:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i would like to bring them out and
 
04:47:40.470 --> 04:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
and we have a reference to an rsa down
 
04:47:42.948 --> 04:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
here that applies only to veterinarians
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
whereas a lot of medications are now
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
purchasable online and or through
 
04:47:49.750 --> 04:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
tractor supply down the street a plus
 
04:47:52.550 --> 04:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
applicable to be administered by the
 
04:47:54.868 --> 04:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
owner of the animals or livestock and
 
04:47:58.470 --> 04:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
they would not be protected by this
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
i i understand the point that you're
 
04:48:02.868 --> 04:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
making but with that point i mean this
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
thing going substance by substance you
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
could be here
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
that's what i was trying i'll try to put
 
04:48:09.910 --> 04:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
them all together put them on how's that
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
would you consider chocolate onions
 
04:48:13.520 --> 04:48:14.788 align:start position:0%
would you consider chocolate onions
garlic

04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
garlic
 
04:48:17.430 --> 04:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
to all be considered toxic substances to
 
04:48:17.440 --> 04:48:19.510 align:start position:0%
to all be considered toxic substances to
dogs

04:48:19.510 --> 04:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
may i give a broad answer rather than a
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
specific answer
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
you may answer how any way you wish okay
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
um we're going back to the
 
04:48:33.430 --> 04:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
the uh requirement of cult culpability
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it's the term negligently and it's a
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
growth gross deviation from conduct that
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
a reasonable person would observe in
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
04:48:43.120 --> 04:48:43.910 align:start position:0%
that situation
if

04:48:43.910 --> 04:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:48:45.910 --> 04:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
it could be proven
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
that the person
 
04:48:50.948 --> 04:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
administering any of those substances to
 
04:48:52.230 --> 04:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
an animal
 
04:48:54.310 --> 04:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
knew that they were poison you know they
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
they would be possibly liable under this
 
04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
i would say
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
that probably most poisoning
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
is inadvertent it happens
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
at home
 
04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
by the owner and it's never going to get
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
reported unless it goes to
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
the animal gets a
 
04:49:15.910 --> 04:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
very thorough evaluation by a
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
veterinarian determines what the toxic
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
substance was
 
04:49:22.628 --> 04:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's not going to be an issue what
 
04:49:24.948 --> 04:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
might be issues are things
 
04:49:24.958 --> 04:49:25.830 align:start position:0%
might be issues are things
like

04:49:25.830 --> 04:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:49:25.840 --> 04:49:28.788 align:start position:0%
like
um

04:49:28.788 --> 04:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.230 --> 04:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
golf courses using fertilizer that runs
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
off into
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
your farm's pond and your animals drink
 
04:49:36.958 --> 04:49:37.830 align:start position:0%
your farm's pond and your animals drink
it

04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:49:40.310 --> 04:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
things like that that are
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
not meant to poison the animal
 
04:49:56.708 --> 04:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.550 --> 04:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's a question about having a
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
chicken coop so i'm referring to line
 
04:50:02.868 --> 04:50:02.878 align:start position:0%
lines 18 where it says
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
other vermin in either the building or
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
to protect their crops shall be exempt
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
the way i interpreted that
 
04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
was to not include a chicken coop
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
so i just didn't know if
 
04:50:20.708 --> 04:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:20.718 --> 04:50:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
would

04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
if i may ask a follow-up thank you for
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question if the
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
term building was changed to property
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
would that
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
have any impact on the intent of this
 
04:50:30.718 --> 04:50:36.150 align:start position:0%
have any impact on the intent of this
bill

04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
we basically
 
04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
transferred the terminology from
 
04:50:41.680 --> 04:50:45.270 align:start position:0%
transferred the terminology from
644-16

04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:48.230 --> 04:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
in his own building or upon his crops he
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty
 
04:50:51.510 --> 04:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
so building in
 
04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
crops is
 
04:50:52.878 --> 04:50:54.550 align:start position:0%
crops is
related

04:50:54.550 --> 04:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
related
 
04:50:54.560 --> 04:50:55.830 align:start position:0%
related
to

04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
homeowners farmers
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
those types of things the legal question
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
may be is the chicken coop considered a
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
building so i think i just just that's a
 
04:51:06.070 --> 04:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
simple fix in the drafting but the coop
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
itself is a building but the eggs and
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
feed inside it is not
 
04:51:09.840 --> 04:51:11.270 align:start position:0%
feed inside it is not
okay

04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
but i don't understand
 
04:51:16.628 --> 04:51:16.638 align:start position:0%
if you're distributing
 
04:51:20.070 --> 04:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
putting out rat poison or mouse poison
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's on your property
 
04:51:24.070 --> 04:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
by your buildings it's to protect your
 
04:51:24.080 --> 04:51:27.190 align:start position:0%
by your buildings it's to protect your
property

04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
it's exempt from this
 
04:51:32.390 --> 04:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
i think the chair was getting at the
 
04:51:33.830 --> 04:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
fact that sometimes you put the poison
 
04:51:36.708 --> 04:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
out not in the building or
 
04:51:36.718 --> 04:51:37.430 align:start position:0%
out not in the building or
or

04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
directly surrounding the building but
 
04:51:40.470 --> 04:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
you put it out
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
to deter
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
to the building so it could be anywhere
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
on your property right
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh chair and thank you for
 
04:51:54.628 --> 04:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
if i'm reading the bill correctly now
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
that i understand what is new and what
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:05.750 --> 04:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
what basically this is going to do is if
 
04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
i put out which i don't use
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
because i have chickens i don't use rat
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
poison but if i put out rat poison
 
04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
in a box and a dog chewed into that
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to be held liable right
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
but if
 
04:52:19.440 --> 04:52:20.310 align:start position:0%
but if
a

04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:52:20.320 --> 04:52:21.910 align:start position:0%
a
neighbor

04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
neighbor
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
is sick of listening to his neighbors
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
dog barking 22 hours a day and he throws
 
04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
poison over the fence
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
then that guy purposely did it and will
 
04:52:35.990 --> 04:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
face these charges exactly
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the line of the
 
04:52:51.990 --> 04:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
bolded lines that you're talking about
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
it makes reference to rsa 3332 b correct
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
and i am it says in accordance with
 
04:52:58.798 --> 04:53:00.390 align:start position:0%
and i am it says in accordance with
rsa332b

04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
rsa332b
 
04:53:00.400 --> 04:53:01.190 align:start position:0%
rsa332b
and

04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
it has 20 subsections to it and i'm i'm
 
04:53:05.430 --> 04:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
trying to find out which one is the
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
right one that that it's actually
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
pointing to and should that in fact be
 
04:53:10.788 --> 04:53:10.798 align:start position:0%
in the in
 
04:53:13.510 --> 04:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically if it's part of a
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
patient-client relationship with a
 
04:53:15.840 --> 04:53:17.350 align:start position:0%
patient-client relationship with a
veterinarian

04:53:17.350 --> 04:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
veterinarian
 
04:53:20.550 --> 04:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
if if if that
 
04:53:23.910 --> 04:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
animal gets a hold it is
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
being treated for something
 
04:53:29.190 --> 04:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
that turns out to be toxic for that
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
animal then the veterinarian is not
 
04:53:31.440 --> 04:53:36.150 align:start position:0%
animal then the veterinarian is not
liable

04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
it has to be prescribed by a
 
04:53:40.470 --> 04:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
veterinarian as part of a veterinary
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
client relationship
 
04:53:44.470 --> 04:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative newman you recognize for
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
04:53:47.350 --> 04:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
i guess my follow-up is we're talking
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
about putting out rat traps or something
 
04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
with people that are putting out
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
poisons that they bought
 
04:53:57.750 --> 04:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
and didn't get prescribed by a
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
veterinarian be exempted in 332 b is
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
that the right place it should be or do
 
04:54:05.590 --> 04:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand that well
 
04:54:09.190 --> 04:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
if if you were you if you are using
 
04:54:09.200 --> 04:54:10.350 align:start position:0%
if if you were you if you are using
um

04:54:10.350 --> 04:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
insecticides for
 
04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
ants or you're doing rat traps you're
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
for your property you're exempt
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
it would be an accident if your animal
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
got a hold of it it's not a crime
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to protect your property
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
i have one more follow-up
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up yeah thank
 
04:54:36.788 --> 04:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
you and i i guess just the problem is
 
04:54:36.798 --> 04:54:37.750 align:start position:0%
you and i i guess just the problem is
this

04:54:37.750 --> 04:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:54:37.760 --> 04:54:39.430 align:start position:0%
this

describes
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
to people how they can be exempt from
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
that and it points directly to the to
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
rsa 332b

no
 
04:54:52.708 --> 04:54:52.718 align:start position:0%
it's two exemptions
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
one for 332b and that's the veterinary
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
client relationship and another one if
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
you're protecting your property from
 
04:55:01.280 --> 04:55:03.910 align:start position:0%
you're protecting your property from

they're separate

but in in both
 
04:55:07.440 --> 04:55:09.510 align:start position:0%
but in in both
follow-up

04:55:09.510 --> 04:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
recognize for a follow-up in both of the
 
04:55:15.990 --> 04:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
places the only the only rsa i see
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
referenced in the law
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
as it's written here
 
04:55:23.110 --> 04:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
is 332b and and i guess i'm probably not
 
04:55:25.270 --> 04:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
asking the question right i cannot find
 
04:55:27.510 --> 04:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
any language in the bill that exempts a
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
person who is not a veterinarian
 
04:55:30.320 --> 04:55:31.430 align:start position:0%
person who is not a veterinarian
from

04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the penalty be i just can't find it
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:37.600 --> 04:55:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:44.788 --> 04:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
so it may need a definition or something
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
like that i i don't know but i just
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
cannot find something that allows me to
 
04:55:49.670 --> 04:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
follow what i'm supposed to do in
 
04:55:52.230 --> 04:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
accordance with it okay can't find it it
 
04:55:55.510 --> 04:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
says persons using poison to control
 
04:55:57.750 --> 04:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
rats and other vermin in either their
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
building or protect their crops shall be
 
04:56:03.750 --> 04:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
exempt from this paragraph it's a direct
 
04:56:05.430 --> 04:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
is that in the is that in the bill or
 
04:56:06.788 --> 04:56:06.798 align:start position:0%
what are you referring to
 
04:56:07.750 --> 04:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
first of all i'm just going to go over
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
this quickly and i
 
04:56:12.310 --> 04:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
feel like we do it every meeting but
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
we'll do it again thank you mr chair in
 
04:56:15.910 --> 04:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
order for anyone to speak they need to
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
be recognized to speak
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
if as you could if you want a follow-up
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
question you may ask we are not
 
04:56:23.270 --> 04:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
permitted to debate members of the
 
04:56:26.550 --> 04:56:26.560 align:start position:0%

information about the bill
 
04:56:31.030 --> 04:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
clarify their testimony that that is it
 
04:56:33.190 --> 04:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions will be out of order
 
04:56:34.830 --> 04:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
anyone who's speaking of being
 
04:56:37.990 --> 04:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
recognized i will rule them out of order
 
04:56:39.190 --> 04:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
but representative newman you are
 
04:56:42.550 --> 04:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
recognized for a follow-up question
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i don't have a
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up question i'm just confused and
 
04:56:54.708 --> 04:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:03.510 --> 04:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative green you're recognized
 
04:57:05.270 --> 04:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:57:06.550 --> 04:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:57:07.270 --> 04:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
what if
 
04:57:07.280 --> 04:57:08.948 align:start position:0%
what if
[Music]

04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:57:13.110 --> 04:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:15.030 --> 04:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
in an area where he was exposed to
 
04:57:17.270 --> 04:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
either marijuana or
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
ingredients of marijuana
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
and digested those how would this be
 
04:57:21.360 --> 04:57:24.628 align:start position:0%
and digested those how would this be
handled

04:57:24.628 --> 04:57:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:28.230 --> 04:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
this is a not an uncommon occurrence
 
04:57:28.240 --> 04:57:29.190 align:start position:0%
this is a not an uncommon occurrence
and

04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:29.200 --> 04:57:30.550 align:start position:0%
and
marijuana

04:57:30.550 --> 04:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
04:57:33.510 --> 04:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the dosage or cbd depending
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
on the dosage can be very toxic to
 
04:57:35.600 --> 04:57:37.030 align:start position:0%
on the dosage can be very toxic to
animals

04:57:37.030 --> 04:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
animals
 
04:57:37.040 --> 04:57:37.830 align:start position:0%
animals
now

04:57:37.830 --> 04:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:57:39.510 --> 04:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
this may happen in the home and it may
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
be the homeowner that's
 
04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
at issue with this
 
04:57:43.360 --> 04:57:44.150 align:start position:0%
at issue with this
so

04:57:44.150 --> 04:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:46.708 --> 04:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
ideally a responsible owner would take
 
04:57:49.270 --> 04:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
their animal to the veterinarian
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:57:52.628 --> 04:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian would do a history and
 
04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
figure out what happened
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
um it would probably go no further than
 
04:57:56.878 --> 04:57:57.670 align:start position:0%
um it would probably go no further than
that

04:57:57.670 --> 04:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:57:59.830 --> 04:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
unless the veterinarian wanted to turn
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
them in
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
now if it's your roommate and you want
 
04:58:05.670 --> 04:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
to turn them in
 
04:58:08.150 --> 04:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's up to you because
 
04:58:09.990 --> 04:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
technically a crime would have been
 
04:58:11.910 --> 04:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
committed if the animal became sick or
 
04:58:13.590 --> 04:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
died from it
 
04:58:17.430 --> 04:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:20.310 --> 04:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up
 
04:58:22.470 --> 04:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire like other states in our
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
area is pushing for marijuana legalizing
 
04:58:24.718 --> 04:58:25.670 align:start position:0%
area is pushing for marijuana legalizing
it

04:58:25.670 --> 04:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
and if people starting to grow this
 
04:58:28.480 --> 04:58:30.150 align:start position:0%
and if people starting to grow this
product

04:58:30.150 --> 04:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
product
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm asking
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
that is that i don't i don't find that
 
04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
question germane to the bill
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
well it would be more available whether
 
04:58:40.708 --> 04:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
it's cannabis is legal for recreational
 
04:58:42.070 --> 04:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
purposes or not it can still be
 
04:58:45.350 --> 04:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
considered a poison just like
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
just like alcohol it can still be
 
04:58:48.550 --> 04:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
poisonous and be
 
04:58:51.030 --> 04:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
legal for recreational purposes
 
04:58:53.110 --> 04:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to get off track on the
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
subject of cannabis
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering if we're growing
 
04:59:00.230 --> 04:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
it if it does pass and we're growing it
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
and dogs get in there
 
04:59:10.390 --> 04:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:59:15.190 --> 04:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
i'm deeming the question out of order
 
04:59:16.628 --> 04:59:16.638 align:start position:0%
and representative you are also out of
 
04:59:18.470 --> 04:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
order for making the pizza comment i do
 
04:59:18.480 --> 04:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
order for making the pizza comment i do
apologize

04:59:29.480 --> 04:59:29.490 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:29.490 --> 04:59:41.350 align:start position:0%

i'll apologize to the
 
04:59:43.120 --> 04:59:44.948 align:start position:0%
i'll apologize to the

witness
 
04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
on behalf of everyone
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:52.868 --> 04:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:59:55.910 --> 04:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
i was political science not pre-med
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
so i i appreciate your
 
05:00:01.440 --> 05:00:02.948 align:start position:0%
so i i appreciate your
explanation

05:00:02.948 --> 05:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
05:00:05.990 --> 05:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
of why you're making changes
 
05:00:08.470 --> 05:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
i understand why you wanna
 
05:00:13.190 --> 05:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:15.190 --> 05:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
i get what i don't understand ma'am is
 
05:00:17.990 --> 05:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
why the new language
 
05:00:20.550 --> 05:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
is being put in
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
i would think just by repealing
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
without the new language
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
it covers mistreatments of animals being
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
dogs and household pets and
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's already covered by all of that i
 
05:00:35.190 --> 05:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
think maybe
 
05:00:38.708 --> 05:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
that's adding to some confusion
 
05:00:45.270 --> 05:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
the poisoning would still be covered
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
even without these new without the the
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
new wording being put in is that
 
05:00:55.110 --> 05:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
incorrect that that i mean if if you i
 
05:00:57.910 --> 05:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
accidentally poison a dog that's gonna
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's mistreating uh
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
causes animals
 
05:01:01.520 --> 05:01:04.948 align:start position:0%
causes animals
it's

05:01:04.948 --> 05:01:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
mutilated it's
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
it seems that the words are already
 
05:01:09.360 --> 05:01:11.990 align:start position:0%
it seems that the words are already
there

05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
even if the bold letters were taken out
 
05:01:19.990 --> 05:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
05:01:20.000 --> 05:01:21.430 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
and

05:01:21.430 --> 05:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:24.470 --> 05:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
probably as far as the misdemeanor
 
05:01:26.310 --> 05:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
negligent offense
 
05:01:28.948 --> 05:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
you are very very correct
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
05:01:31.680 --> 05:01:33.430 align:start position:0%
in fact
when

05:01:33.430 --> 05:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:01:33.440 --> 05:01:34.230 align:start position:0%
when
i

05:01:34.230 --> 05:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
recommend that when animals are poisoned
 
05:01:40.230 --> 05:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement use the cruelty law
 
05:01:42.550 --> 05:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
rather than the current one that we're
 
05:01:44.990 --> 05:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
repealing the older one
 
05:01:45.000 --> 05:01:46.868 align:start position:0%
repealing the older one
644-16

05:01:46.868 --> 05:01:46.878 align:start position:0%
644-16
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
but one of the issues is if you get down
 
05:01:51.830 --> 05:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
line 28
 
05:01:54.080 --> 05:01:55.590 align:start position:0%
line 28
3a

05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
3a
 
05:01:58.070 --> 05:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
if you look at that list of felony
 
05:01:58.080 --> 05:01:59.510 align:start position:0%
if you look at that list of felony
offenses

05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
05:02:02.550 --> 05:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
those are words that come directly
 
05:02:02.560 --> 05:02:03.670 align:start position:0%
those are words that come directly
from

05:02:03.670 --> 05:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
up above the negligent offenses
 
05:02:07.360 --> 05:02:09.110 align:start position:0%
up above the negligent offenses
okay

05:02:09.110 --> 05:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:02:11.750 --> 05:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
so in order for it to be a felony it's
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
got to be a word in there and that word
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
is not up above
 
05:02:18.310 --> 05:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the fennel
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the misdemeanor offenses
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we would need to add it and then in
 
05:02:26.948 --> 05:02:26.958 align:start position:0%
looking at adding it when laws are
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
written now we like to put in
 
05:02:31.590 --> 05:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
definitions and explanations rather than
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
just words because those can be
 
05:02:33.360 --> 05:02:34.948 align:start position:0%
just words because those can be
misinterpreted

05:02:34.948 --> 05:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
exposing distributing or administering
 
05:02:43.830 --> 05:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
an active poison or toxic substance and
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
why we put in the
 
05:02:45.600 --> 05:02:47.350 align:start position:0%
why we put in the
um

05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:47.360 --> 05:02:48.788 align:start position:0%
um
exceptions

05:02:48.788 --> 05:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
because there are instances when it
 
05:02:52.550 --> 05:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
05:02:55.270 --> 05:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
05:03:04.390 --> 05:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
the two representatives are having a
 
05:03:06.868 --> 05:03:06.878 align:start position:0%
conversation so we wouldn't want to
 
05:03:06.878 --> 05:03:10.230 align:start position:0%
conversation so we wouldn't want to
interrupt

05:03:10.230 --> 05:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
when they're done i'll recognize you for
 
05:03:14.550 --> 05:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
a follow-up representative true that's
 
05:03:22.230 --> 05:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chan
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:29.760 --> 05:03:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:03:31.190 --> 05:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:33.910 --> 05:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
i would i would say
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
being a political science major
 
05:03:36.400 --> 05:03:38.868 align:start position:0%
being a political science major
that

05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.878 --> 05:03:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:41.040 --> 05:03:42.550 align:start position:0%
uh
purposely

05:03:42.550 --> 05:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
purposely
 
05:03:45.990 --> 05:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
poisoning a dog is torturing that dog
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't kill it it's going to be
 
05:03:49.830 --> 05:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
violently ill
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
you're causing
 
05:03:54.310 --> 05:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
a severe reaction from the dog
 
05:03:56.550 --> 05:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
for the dog
 
05:03:58.788 --> 05:03:58.798 align:start position:0%
the dog is being tortured he may even be
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
torched to death
 
05:04:05.590 --> 05:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:09.030 --> 05:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm thinking
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's already covered i just thought it
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
would be a lot cleaner if
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
repeal these rsas thank you very much
 
05:04:17.280 --> 05:04:21.910 align:start position:0%
repeal these rsas thank you very much
um

05:04:21.910 --> 05:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission has
 
05:04:27.430 --> 05:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of issues with the
 
05:04:30.550 --> 05:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
terminology because it's not defined and
 
05:04:32.788 --> 05:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
torture is one of those words
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
we're aware of things that are happening
 
05:04:39.030 --> 05:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
that are not covered in this bill for
 
05:04:42.390 --> 05:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the felony offenses that we can't
 
05:04:46.230 --> 05:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
that can't be proved in a court of law
 
05:04:48.070 --> 05:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
if you
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
if you look up the word
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
torture you're not going to find
 
05:04:53.190 --> 05:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
poisoning in there
 
05:04:54.708 --> 05:04:54.718 align:start position:0%
if you look up
 
05:04:54.718 --> 05:04:56.708 align:start position:0%
if you look up
um

05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know we have we have issues with
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
starvation as well because that's not in
 
05:05:02.310 --> 05:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
here i mean it's
 
05:05:04.150 --> 05:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
covered because they're not providing
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
food but it's not
 
05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
a felony offense right off the bat so
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:05:11.590 --> 05:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
missing pieces in this law that someday
 
05:05:16.550 --> 05:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
we would like to correct and but that's
 
05:05:17.670 --> 05:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
why we put
 
05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls angela ferrari
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%

05:06:04.708 --> 05:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
my name is angela ferrari i'm here
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
representing dog owners of the granite
 
05:06:06.400 --> 05:06:07.350 align:start position:0%
representing dog owners of the granite
state

05:06:07.350 --> 05:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:06:10.150 --> 05:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
we are an akc affiliated non-profit
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
organization founded in 1991 to
 
05:06:15.030 --> 05:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
represent the interests of all pet
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
owners in new hampshire and we have a
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
wide variety of membership
 
05:06:22.070 --> 05:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
from pet owners to breeders to various
 
05:06:28.230 --> 05:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
dog owners of the granite state opposes
 
05:06:32.788 --> 05:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
this bill as written which you know
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
might surprise you since we do represent
 
05:06:36.150 --> 05:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
the interests of dogs and their owners
 
05:06:38.550 --> 05:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
however as you've had great discussion
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
on already
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
our main concern is around the use of
 
05:06:47.350 --> 05:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
the word negligent and the section
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
f that's been added here on line 15
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
with so much
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
variety and ability for somebody to
 
05:06:56.240 --> 05:06:57.750 align:start position:0%
variety and ability for somebody to
accidentally

05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
accidentally
 
05:06:57.760 --> 05:06:58.788 align:start position:0%
accidentally
have

05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
poisonous substances around that could
 
05:07:02.868 --> 05:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
affect a dog
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
we feel that this sets up owners
 
05:07:07.910 --> 05:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
friends of owners
 
05:07:07.920 --> 05:07:10.070 align:start position:0%
friends of owners
neighbors

05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
too much
 
05:07:13.350 --> 05:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
to be pulled into this for criminal
 
05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
so it's too open to interpretation i
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
think we've already had a lot of trouble
 
05:07:25.030 --> 05:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
discussing each of the various poisons
 
05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
that could be considered part of the
 
05:07:26.718 --> 05:07:27.590 align:start position:0%
that could be considered part of the
spill

05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
spill
 
05:07:29.350 --> 05:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
and how that
 
05:07:31.510 --> 05:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
would be considered negligent actions or
 
05:07:31.520 --> 05:07:33.190 align:start position:0%
would be considered negligent actions or
not

05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the inability to
 
05:07:38.310 --> 05:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
say if these different actions would
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
actually be considered negligent we
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
heard the word purposefully a lot
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
and that's a totally different section
 
05:07:47.590 --> 05:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill and negligent versus
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
purposely is very different
 
05:07:52.230 --> 05:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
so while we do not
 
05:07:55.350 --> 05:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
support the addition of negligently
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
poisoning animals as part of this bill
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
we do understand the changes that are
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
being made in regards to purposeful
 
05:08:02.718 --> 05:08:03.830 align:start position:0%
being made in regards to purposeful
poisoning

05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
poisoning
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
and adding
 
05:08:06.788 --> 05:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
poisons to
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
the section that starts at line 28 in
 
05:08:11.030 --> 05:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
however as
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
raised by representative true
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
we do believe that the existing laws do
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
cover purposeful poisoning with the use
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the language that is already
 
05:08:23.760 --> 05:08:24.050 align:start position:0%
of the language that is already
in

05:08:24.050 --> 05:08:24.060 align:start position:0%

and that goes for torturing

where it says unnecessary suffering of
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
any kind so we feel that poison is
 
05:08:41.280 --> 05:08:42.708 align:start position:0%
any kind so we feel that poison is
represented

05:08:42.708 --> 05:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
represented
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
with our current law
 
05:08:44.958 --> 05:08:46.310 align:start position:0%
with our current law
and

05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
we would be okay with the two sections
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
being repealed and adding poison there
 
05:08:52.948 --> 05:08:52.958 align:start position:0%
if you felt as a committee with your
 
05:08:55.270 --> 05:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
experience in how the law is written
 
05:08:58.150 --> 05:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
that it would be cleaner
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
reduce any confusion or remove any
 
05:09:02.948 --> 05:09:02.958 align:start position:0%
loopholes that may be there with the
 
05:09:05.510 --> 05:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
existing statutes
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
but we don't necessarily believe that it
 
05:09:10.550 --> 05:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
is required
 
05:09:10.560 --> 05:09:11.430 align:start position:0%
is required
so

05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:12.948 --> 05:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
we would hope that you would remove the
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
second the section on negligent
 
05:09:14.798 --> 05:09:17.190 align:start position:0%
second the section on negligent
poisoning

05:09:17.190 --> 05:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
poisoning
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
add poisons if you felt appropriate and
 
05:09:22.550 --> 05:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
repeal those other sections or
 
05:09:25.350 --> 05:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
vote the bill in expedient to legislate
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
 
05:09:26.718 --> 05:09:33.190 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to take any
questions

05:09:33.190 --> 05:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.430 --> 05:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
representatives plain you're recognized
 
05:09:38.550 --> 05:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
i promise to behave mr chair thank you
 
05:09:40.150 --> 05:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair for letting me ask a
 
05:09:41.350 --> 05:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for the member
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um i appreciate
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
you coming here to testify today i had a
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
lot of concerns that you you've also
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
spoken to
 
05:09:51.110 --> 05:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
one concern that you did not mention
 
05:09:53.510 --> 05:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
is the section that only exempts
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
veterinarians from
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
administering medication do you have an
 
05:10:00.390 --> 05:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
opinion on that
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
it was raised earlier about the ability
 
05:10:03.788 --> 05:10:03.798 align:start position:0%
to purchase
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
veterinarian-like products from tractor
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
supply online other things like that
 
05:10:12.470 --> 05:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i do think that
 
05:10:15.190 --> 05:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
while we should exempt veterinarians if
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
they were to prescribe something that
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
didn't work appropriately for an animal
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
that we should make sure that the owner
 
05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
of the animals or
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
owners of residences where they may
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
bring their dogs wouldn't be
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
considered negligently poisoning if
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
those dogs were to get into those
 
05:10:32.878 --> 05:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
those dogs were to get into those
products

05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
products
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:43.350 --> 05:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i only have this
 
05:10:45.510 --> 05:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
simple question
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
your association dog owners of granite
 
05:10:47.920 --> 05:10:49.190 align:start position:0%
your association dog owners of granite
state

05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
do they
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
belong to or part of
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission on human
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
treatment of animals yes we do have a
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:06.390 --> 05:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:08.070 --> 05:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
if the chair may inquire with with a
 
05:11:09.670 --> 05:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
question and uh thank you for taking my
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
question if the
 
05:11:12.788 --> 05:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
under on line 15 where it says
 
05:11:15.590 --> 05:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
negligently on the first page
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
would it change your
 
05:11:19.190 --> 05:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
the your position of the organization's
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
position that was changed to perhaps
 
05:11:21.120 --> 05:11:27.990 align:start position:0%
position that was changed to perhaps
recklessly

05:11:27.990 --> 05:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:30.310 --> 05:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
i think i would have to think about that
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
and get the opinion from some of the
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
other members of our group
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
to have a better understanding of
 
05:11:41.030 --> 05:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
recklessly in comparison to negligently
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
as my background doesn't allow me to to
 
05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
answer that on the spot
 
05:11:50.550 --> 05:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:52.868 --> 05:11:52.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:56.150 --> 05:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
you are you are excused thank you
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
is not my printout
 
05:12:29.830 --> 05:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
one of our members is unable to attend
 
05:12:32.230 --> 05:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
she's housebound at this point in time
 
05:12:34.788 --> 05:12:34.798 align:start position:0%
and had some concerns
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
so i was just going to try to do some of
 
05:12:38.788 --> 05:12:38.798 align:start position:0%
the highlights but
 
05:12:40.948 --> 05:12:40.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of it majority of it has already
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
been covered
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
um but there is a you know
 
05:12:47.670 --> 05:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
question she had is this bill actually
 
05:12:49.510 --> 05:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
promoting pet welfare or is it just one
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
more burden on a pet owner facing
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
veterinarian bills as
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know with the poisoning
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
and you know the ace aspca runs an
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
animal poison hotline and they list the
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
top 10 poisons
 
05:13:04.390 --> 05:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
05:13:06.070 --> 05:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
that are you know animals the dogs the
 
05:13:06.080 --> 05:13:07.990 align:start position:0%
that are you know animals the dogs the
cats

05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
cats
 
05:13:08.000 --> 05:13:09.270 align:start position:0%
cats
and

05:13:09.270 --> 05:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
you know going over them
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't think of it how many people
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
know that grapes are poisonous to the
 
05:13:16.000 --> 05:13:17.590 align:start position:0%
know that grapes are poisonous to the
dogs

05:13:17.590 --> 05:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
how many people know that onions and
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
i've had i've had this scenario with a
 
05:13:23.750 --> 05:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
friend of mine that
 
05:13:26.708 --> 05:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
i was showing their dogs and
 
05:13:28.310 --> 05:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
he didn't think of it
 
05:13:30.708 --> 05:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
they had a roast beef meal
 
05:13:30.718 --> 05:13:31.670 align:start position:0%
they had a roast beef meal
and

05:13:31.670 --> 05:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
they put onions on top of it so they
 
05:13:36.708 --> 05:13:36.718 align:start position:0%
gave him the dog the juice
 
05:13:39.030 --> 05:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
into his uh food
 
05:13:40.948 --> 05:13:40.958 align:start position:0%
dog ended up having uh
 
05:13:40.958 --> 05:13:42.550 align:start position:0%

relative to penalties for poisoning dogs
 
05:14:52.150 --> 05:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
in particular the area of negligence
 
05:14:54.150 --> 05:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
when it comes to animals accidentally
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
ingesting toxic substances
 
05:14:57.120 --> 05:14:58.708 align:start position:0%
ingesting toxic substances
and

05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%

it turns around
and

05:15:03.990 --> 05:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that popped in my mind
 
05:15:06.628 --> 05:15:06.638 align:start position:0%
when i
 
05:15:08.310 --> 05:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
was reading this and talking about the
 
05:15:10.868 --> 05:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
thinking about the poison line now are
 
05:15:13.030 --> 05:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
they going to turn around
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
and call the state and say this person
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
poison their dog
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it's like
 
05:15:20.550 --> 05:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
do they have any information whether
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
it's on purpose or not no they won't
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
they won't know you know you you
 
05:15:26.310 --> 05:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
families with kids
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
one's eating a grape so they share it if
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
they've got a small dog one great can
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
really make that dog sick
 
05:15:34.868 --> 05:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
it's you know
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be really hard as far as i'm
 
05:15:36.718 --> 05:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be really hard as far as i'm
concerned

05:15:37.990 --> 05:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
05:15:41.110 --> 05:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
to follow up and put this into into play
 
05:15:42.868 --> 05:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
you know i just
 
05:15:45.990 --> 05:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's my feelings and then
 
05:15:48.628 --> 05:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
on my other side
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
when we first got into
 
05:15:53.670 --> 05:15:53.680 align:start position:0%

and a half years old
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
i don't know how she lived because i
 
05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
think she was given anything and
 
05:16:04.390 --> 05:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
everything that we ate
 
05:16:04.400 --> 05:16:05.670 align:start position:0%
everything that we ate
but

05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:16:07.190 --> 05:16:07.200 align:start position:0%

it was up on the mantel don't ask me how
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
she got it but she got it down
 
05:16:22.788 --> 05:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
and but she was very picky
 
05:16:24.550 --> 05:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
she would take a bite out and spit it
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
out if she didn't like it
 
05:16:26.798 --> 05:16:27.830 align:start position:0%
out if she didn't like it
but

05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
this was also a dog that always thought
 
05:16:30.550 --> 05:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
you were going to poison her because she
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
had she did would spit out her food and
 
05:16:34.708 --> 05:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
then say oh i guess i can eat it
 
05:16:36.310 --> 05:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
but i mean
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%

05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
that you know not they're eating
 
05:16:40.550 --> 05:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
something they're going to give it to
 
05:16:41.670 --> 05:16:41.680 align:start position:0%

good afternoon i was just here to answer
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
any questions uh if you had any
 
05:23:47.110 --> 05:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
questions about the amendment to the
 
05:23:48.310 --> 05:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill but obviously you don't have that
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
yet i can read it if you'd like
 
05:23:52.868 --> 05:23:52.878 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind sure
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh so what we did like i said was we
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
mirrored this off of conduct after an
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
accident if a driver fails to identify
 
05:23:58.718 --> 05:23:59.830 align:start position:0%
accident if a driver fails to identify
themselves

05:23:59.830 --> 05:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
after an accident and we use that same
 
05:24:04.150 --> 05:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
methodology to apply it to this type of
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
incident so we titled it conduct and
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%

05:24:08.160 --> 05:24:10.390 align:start position:0%

05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony if i may
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
inquire with a question and thank you
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:01.670 --> 05:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
one one of the concerns that i'm not
 
05:26:03.670 --> 05:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
sure if the amendment addressed this but
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
it says
 
05:26:08.070 --> 05:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
on line three if a dog is off leash and
 
05:26:09.750 --> 05:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
injures a person
 
05:26:12.150 --> 05:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
and i guess is there any reason to have
 
05:26:14.230 --> 05:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
a leash requirement in order for whether
 
05:26:15.670 --> 05:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
the underlying policy or the amended
 
05:26:17.190 --> 05:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
policy to apply
 
05:26:18.628 --> 05:26:18.638 align:start position:0%
no sir and that's why i took it out so
 
05:26:20.628 --> 05:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
my background involves i was an officer
 
05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
in the k-9 unit i was a supervisor in
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
the k-9 unit and i was the officer in
 
05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
charge of the k-9 unit the one rule of
 
05:26:29.510 --> 05:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
handling any animal is that animal is
 
05:26:32.150 --> 05:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
under your control a leash is not needed
 
05:26:34.070 --> 05:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate control i can give hand
 
05:26:36.150 --> 05:26:36.160 align:start position:0%
and arm signals to my dog or verbal
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
commands and still control my animal
 
05:26:39.750 --> 05:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
there are various methods of control a
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
leash is just one such method
 
05:26:46.628 --> 05:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:48.470 --> 05:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and if i inquire with another
 
05:26:52.230 --> 05:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
question if a person is bit by a dog
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
is there any unless you have have the
 
05:26:56.708 --> 05:26:56.718 align:start position:0%
dog's information like on their call or
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
whatnot what's the what's the procedure
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
done at that time
 
05:27:02.948 --> 05:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
so pretty much it's just uh exchanging
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
information to make we would make a
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
police report uh we could take criminal
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
action already from established rsas
 
05:27:12.150 --> 05:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
this is just to ensure that the
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
person bit can seek
 
05:27:14.718 --> 05:27:16.310 align:start position:0%

legal
 
05:27:18.548 --> 05:27:18.558 align:start position:0%
ramifications for the injury through
 
05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.390 --> 05:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes thank you mr
 
05:27:27.830 --> 05:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:27:30.548 --> 05:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
question when this bill first came out i
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
actually was i'm having conversations
 
05:27:33.990 --> 05:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
with representative hopper and
 
05:27:35.750 --> 05:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative erf about
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
being a co-sponsor but my concern was
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
the very question that our chairman just
 
05:27:43.030 --> 05:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
brought up about the leash
 
05:27:46.310 --> 05:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
so as you have witnessed the
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:27:49.270 --> 05:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
many of us legislators have the
 
05:27:52.548 --> 05:27:52.558 align:start position:0%
uncanny ability to split many hairs
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
over wording so
 
05:27:57.430 --> 05:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
is it true that the definition off leash
 
05:28:00.548 --> 05:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
in itself means not in control
 
05:28:02.390 --> 05:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
or do we need does that need to change
 
05:28:04.788 --> 05:28:04.798 align:start position:0%
so that doesn't say the term
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
off leash so the leash component was
 
05:28:08.948 --> 05:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
eliminated completely from the amendment
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay as well as canine solely uh you
 
05:28:13.670 --> 05:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
could have an incident with a horse
 
05:28:15.030 --> 05:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
where somebody's riding down the road
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
the horse bucks it runs into a car car
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
causes several thousand damage dollars
 
05:28:21.590 --> 05:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
worth of damage the owner of the horse
 
05:28:23.590 --> 05:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
still has a responsibility to
 
05:28:25.270 --> 05:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
identify themselves just so they can
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
work out some type of solution
 
05:28:26.638 --> 05:28:28.628 align:start position:0%
work out some type of solution
afterwards

05:28:28.628 --> 05:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
05:28:30.868 --> 05:28:30.878 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:37.830 --> 05:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
05:28:39.670 --> 05:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
chief with the uh
 
05:28:41.510 --> 05:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
you say that they didn't have to give
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
any information
 
05:28:45.750 --> 05:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
do they give you any information
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
such as charts and things like that
 
05:28:50.788 --> 05:28:50.798 align:start position:0%
when you make a report
 
05:28:52.390 --> 05:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
are you talking about with the specific
 
05:28:54.390 --> 05:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
incident yeah so dunbarton police
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
actually responded to that scene and
 
05:28:57.990 --> 05:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
they were able to stop the owner of the
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
canine from leaving she was intent on
 
05:29:02.948 --> 05:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
leaving without identifying herself from
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
that scene so we started asking the
 
05:29:06.868 --> 05:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
question what if she did leave and
 
05:29:08.070 --> 05:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
that's when we contacted the
 
05:29:09.910 --> 05:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
hillsborough north county attorney's
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
office and found out there were no
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
repercussions if she did leave and
 
05:29:15.510 --> 05:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
follow him
 
05:29:17.590 --> 05:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
you're recognized um
 
05:29:20.948 --> 05:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't there be a penalty to her
 
05:29:23.430 --> 05:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
or the person leaving
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
because they're not saying whether those
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
dogs had proper shots or anything yes
 
05:29:31.990 --> 05:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
ma'am that's the purpose of this um
 
05:29:33.030 --> 05:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
05:29:34.708 --> 05:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
it makes it a misdemeanor if they leave
 
05:29:36.470 --> 05:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
the scene and they don't
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
report to us in a very timely manner
 
05:29:39.910 --> 05:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
their information and that they were
 
05:29:41.750 --> 05:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
involved with this type of incident
 
05:29:41.760 --> 05:29:42.830 align:start position:0%
involved with this type of incident
thank

05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%

05:29:42.840 --> 05:29:44.548 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you chief
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:29:54.628 --> 05:29:54.638 align:start position:0%
um i i have one small question maybe you
 
05:29:57.510 --> 05:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
can put it to the rest one small concern
 
05:29:58.470 --> 05:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
it says
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that um an officer or
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
point of view mr mr chair i'm sorry

representative true you recognized for
 
05:30:09.510 --> 05:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
your point of order i believe it is uh
 
05:30:10.708 --> 05:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
please state your point of order i
 
05:30:12.310 --> 05:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
believe it is customary and past
 
05:30:12.320 --> 05:30:13.430 align:start position:0%
believe it is customary and past
practice

05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
practice
 
05:30:16.310 --> 05:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
for this committee not to discuss a bill
 
05:30:18.150 --> 05:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
or amendment that is not before the
 
05:30:18.160 --> 05:30:19.110 align:start position:0%
or amendment that is not before the
committee

05:30:19.110 --> 05:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:30:20.628 --> 05:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
i i have a
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
real problem discussing something
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
i know nothing about
 
05:30:26.868 --> 05:30:26.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment we should not be
 
05:30:28.868 --> 05:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment it doesn't
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
exist it's not in the committee
 
05:30:34.628 --> 05:30:34.638 align:start position:0%
i i do i do understand
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying in that
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
you're correct normally when we don't
 
05:30:40.310 --> 05:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
really entertain especially public
 
05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
testimony on an amendment unless
 
05:30:44.150 --> 05:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're in a work session which we're not
 
05:30:47.670 --> 05:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
i i did allow a little bit of uh
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
leeway here because the sponsor of the
 
05:30:51.510 --> 05:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill is a member of the committee who
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
could not be here
 
05:30:55.350 --> 05:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
today so i feel like if representative
 
05:30:56.948 --> 05:30:56.958 align:start position:0%
harper was here
 
05:30:59.350 --> 05:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
he would be the best person to really
 
05:31:00.628 --> 05:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
i don't mean to respect him so he would
 
05:31:03.030 --> 05:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
be a great person to obviously assist
 
05:31:05.030 --> 05:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
the committee but he's not here so i did
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
allow a little bit of extra
 
05:31:09.270 --> 05:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
um slack with that particular rule for
 
05:31:12.390 --> 05:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
that for that reason alone but
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
the witness already read the what the
 
05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
amendment would look like but he
 
05:31:16.868 --> 05:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
actually said that's not what it would
 
05:31:18.628 --> 05:31:18.638 align:start position:0%
be word for word
 
05:31:18.638 --> 05:31:19.510 align:start position:0%
be word for word
and

05:31:19.510 --> 05:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:20.788 --> 05:31:20.798 align:start position:0%
i think it's just
 
05:31:22.708 --> 05:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying but
 
05:31:24.070 --> 05:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
when you are correct with your point of
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
order so i will not permit any more
 
05:31:25.680 --> 05:31:26.788 align:start position:0%
order so i will not permit any more
questions

05:31:26.788 --> 05:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
relating to the amendment that we have
 
05:31:30.788 --> 05:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
not received yet but
 
05:31:32.708 --> 05:31:32.718 align:start position:0%
okay my question still stands because
 
05:31:37.350 --> 05:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:38.548 --> 05:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
that a
 
05:31:40.390 --> 05:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
member of law enforcement shall give the
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
information to the the victim of the dog
 
05:31:45.670 --> 05:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
bite per se
 
05:31:45.680 --> 05:31:46.948 align:start position:0%
bite per se
um

05:31:46.948 --> 05:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:49.830 --> 05:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
so what i'm concerned with is i see a
 
05:31:52.070 --> 05:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
picture of maybe a woman walking her dog
 
05:31:53.670 --> 05:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
down the trail
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
somebody a man gets too close
 
05:31:57.910 --> 05:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
maybe in an inappropriate or even
 
05:31:59.110 --> 05:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
criminal way
 
05:32:01.750 --> 05:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
the dog bites to protect the woman
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
she leaves and now this guy shows up the
 
05:32:05.990 --> 05:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
police station a few hours later and
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
says hey this dog bit me can i get her
 
05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
information and now the statute says the
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
police have to give that information is
 
05:32:13.750 --> 05:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
there any am i am i reading too much
 
05:32:17.190 --> 05:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
so that type of law already exists if
 
05:32:21.510 --> 05:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
somebody was involved in an automobile
 
05:32:21.520 --> 05:32:22.628 align:start position:0%
somebody was involved in an automobile
accident

05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
accident
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact you have to get more
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
information uh in an automobile accident
 
05:32:29.750 --> 05:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
we made it just with name and address so
 
05:32:31.830 --> 05:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up could be obtained otherwise
 
05:32:36.548 --> 05:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:41.670 --> 05:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:43.990 --> 05:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:32:48.230 --> 05:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question the uh
 
05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
says that if a dog is off leash and
 
05:32:53.670 --> 05:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
injures a person
 
05:32:53.680 --> 05:32:55.110 align:start position:0%
injures a person
responsible

05:32:55.110 --> 05:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
05:32:57.270 --> 05:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
provide information
 
05:32:59.430 --> 05:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
so does that mean if the dog is on leash
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
they don't have to provide the
 
05:33:00.718 --> 05:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
they don't have to provide the
information

05:33:02.230 --> 05:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:33:05.350 --> 05:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
no sir it uh results in an injury again
 
05:33:08.548 --> 05:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
a leash does not represent control
 
05:33:10.708 --> 05:33:10.718 align:start position:0%
i had multiple bites when i was in my
 
05:33:12.868 --> 05:33:12.878 align:start position:0%
canine unit some were on leash some were
 
05:33:15.350 --> 05:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
off leash it was all upon my control
 
05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
whether i wanted my off my canine to
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
bite someone
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
in this case if a canine bites someone
 
05:33:23.430 --> 05:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's the failure to control the animal
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
and anticipate what the dog might do
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
which is what happened in this case
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative you recognize for a
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you mr chair and again
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
if the dog is off leash
 
05:33:46.390 --> 05:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that if your definition
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
is in
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
i i think do you don't you feel a plain
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
reading of that
 
05:33:58.948 --> 05:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
minus any definition of what off leash
 
05:34:01.910 --> 05:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
is in the iosa
 
05:34:03.750 --> 05:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
would mean that if he's off leash if
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
he's on leash it doesn't apply
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
so we got rid of the whole leash
 
05:34:08.320 --> 05:34:09.350 align:start position:0%
so we got rid of the whole leash
component

05:34:09.350 --> 05:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
component
 
05:34:11.910 --> 05:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's three incidents types of
 
05:34:14.230 --> 05:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
incidents that went forth in the
 
05:34:14.240 --> 05:34:15.590 align:start position:0%
incidents that went forth in the
amendment

05:34:15.590 --> 05:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:34:17.110 --> 05:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
which include
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
if someone's injured if someone
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
dies from this or if there's personal uh
 
05:34:27.270 --> 05:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
or there's damage to property
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
so if an animal has been involved in an
 
05:34:30.548 --> 05:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
incident which results in death personal
 
05:34:32.708 --> 05:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
injury or damage to property are now the
 
05:34:32.718 --> 05:34:34.230 align:start position:0%
injury or damage to property are now the
requirements

05:34:34.230 --> 05:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:34:37.590 --> 05:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
the control method has been eliminated
 
05:34:50.868 --> 05:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:53.190 --> 05:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative green you were recognized
 
05:34:55.110 --> 05:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:34:58.708 --> 05:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
how would uh puppy be in relation to
 
05:35:01.590 --> 05:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
canine in this wording how would what
 
05:35:01.600 --> 05:35:02.470 align:start position:0%
canine in this wording how would what
puppy

05:35:02.470 --> 05:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
puppy
 
05:35:03.750 --> 05:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
in other words if somebody had a puppy
 
05:35:05.670 --> 05:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
that was maybe six months old too early
 
05:35:07.990 --> 05:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
to be trained
 
05:35:10.310 --> 05:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
and it bit somebody
 
05:35:12.548 --> 05:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
so again it's all on the result of the
 
05:35:14.948 --> 05:35:14.958 align:start position:0%
incident whether somebody's injured dies
 
05:35:17.030 --> 05:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
or there's property damage it doesn't
 
05:35:19.990 --> 05:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
take into account the age or the ability
 
05:35:21.830 --> 05:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the animal it's just the result of an
 
05:35:26.470 --> 05:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative splain you recognized
 
05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and i apologize i was running
 
05:35:32.310 --> 05:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
to ols but if this has been answered
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
already just tell me
 
05:35:36.548 --> 05:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
what if the
 
05:35:39.590 --> 05:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
incident happens on my property
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's not supposed to be on my
 
05:35:41.040 --> 05:35:42.628 align:start position:0%
somebody's not supposed to be on my
property

05:35:42.628 --> 05:35:42.638 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:35:45.270 --> 05:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
but it's not my dog and i refuse to tell
 
05:35:49.510 --> 05:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:51.030 --> 05:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
well you wouldn't be an owner a
 
05:35:53.670 --> 05:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
caretaker uh where if i was watching my
 
05:35:55.750 --> 05:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
son's dog and i refused to develop my
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
son okay so you'd be a caretaker so you
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
would it would be applied to this
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:05.590 --> 05:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative plane you're recognized
 
05:36:06.948 --> 05:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up we
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
we have to run it very strict in here
 
05:36:11.910 --> 05:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and and i apologize mr chair i
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
i apologize for being a little loose on
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
the on the follow-ups um
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
if it's on my own property and the
 
05:36:20.230 --> 05:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
person's not supposed to be on my own
 
05:36:22.230 --> 05:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
property and i refuse to tell them my
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
son owns the dog
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
i would be guilty of this crime at this
 
05:36:27.040 --> 05:36:28.708 align:start position:0%
i would be guilty of this crime at this
point

05:36:28.708 --> 05:36:28.718 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:36:30.310 --> 05:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes because you did not identify
 
05:36:33.350 --> 05:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
yourself and where that what this is is
 
05:36:35.350 --> 05:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
this just to get the information into
 
05:36:37.750 --> 05:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
the judicial system so the judicial
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
system can take into account all the
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:49.670 --> 05:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to get your input on the
 
05:36:51.120 --> 05:36:52.470 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to get your input on the
penalty

05:36:52.470 --> 05:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
05:36:52.480 --> 05:36:53.430 align:start position:0%
penalty
so

05:36:53.430 --> 05:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
the penalty in this case is a
 
05:36:54.718 --> 05:36:56.310 align:start position:0%
the penalty in this case is a
misdemeanor

05:36:56.310 --> 05:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of our other crimes involving
 
05:37:01.430 --> 05:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
animals uh are violations
 
05:37:03.510 --> 05:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
um what's your opinion on that i mean as
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
a as a police officer one of the things
 
05:37:06.708 --> 05:37:06.718 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:11.430 --> 05:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
officers don't pay as much attention to
 
05:37:13.750 --> 05:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
things that are violation level crimes
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh they're less worth their time
 
05:37:16.240 --> 05:37:17.110 align:start position:0%
uh they're less worth their time
um

05:37:17.110 --> 05:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
is that the purpose for
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh for the
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
framing this is a misdemeanor level
 
05:37:23.520 --> 05:37:25.190 align:start position:0%
framing this is a misdemeanor level
violation

05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
violation
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
no sir uh so one thing i preach is
 
05:37:29.670 --> 05:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
circle of influence i can only affect
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
what i can affect
 
05:37:33.750 --> 05:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh a violation you're talking about a
 
05:37:35.350 --> 05:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
fine only
 
05:37:35.360 --> 05:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
fine only
uh

05:37:36.390 --> 05:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:39.510 --> 05:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
if this individual is going
 
05:37:41.430 --> 05:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
to not cooperate and comply with the
 
05:37:43.350 --> 05:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
system and again we're going to explain
 
05:37:46.150 --> 05:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
everything prior to taking action
 
05:37:47.430 --> 05:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
here's what's going to happen here's
 
05:37:48.470 --> 05:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen if you don't
 
05:37:50.150 --> 05:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
provide this information it's going to
 
05:37:52.150 --> 05:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
take some effort for us to finally get
 
05:37:53.910 --> 05:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
that information possibly even a search
 
05:37:55.750 --> 05:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
warrant so you're talking about an
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
enhanced effort by the police department
 
05:37:59.270 --> 05:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
which was taking them away from other
 
05:38:02.070 --> 05:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
community concerns because someone just
 
05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
didn't want to provide information where
 
05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
they were the owner of an animal and
 
05:38:06.708 --> 05:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to take the appropriate
 
05:38:08.390 --> 05:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility based on the actions of
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
the animal
 
05:38:14.788 --> 05:38:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:22.948 --> 05:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:37.510 --> 05:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.190 --> 05:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay the committee now calls angela
 
05:38:39.200 --> 05:38:52.868 align:start position:0%
okay the committee now calls angela
ferrari

05:38:52.868 --> 05:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again
 
05:38:57.030 --> 05:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
angela ferrari dog owners of the granite
 
05:38:57.040 --> 05:38:57.990 align:start position:0%
angela ferrari dog owners of the granite
state

05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:38:59.270 --> 05:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to do the best that i can
 
05:39:01.830 --> 05:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
without having seen the amendment
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
to get our concerns across so it can be
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
taken into account or see if it has
 
05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
already been rectified
 
05:39:12.548 --> 05:39:12.558 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill as written hoping to
 
05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
see some adjustments to it maybe they
 
05:39:16.868 --> 05:39:16.878 align:start position:0%
are in the amendment from what i heard i
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
don't know that necessarily everything
 
05:39:18.480 --> 05:39:19.430 align:start position:0%
don't know that necessarily everything
was

05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
um oh let me give out my testimony
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
so you can see some of our recommended
 
05:39:24.160 --> 05:39:28.310 align:start position:0%
so you can see some of our recommended
changes

05:39:28.310 --> 05:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.548 --> 05:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
when you get the testimony we had some
 
05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
language in red
 
05:39:35.190 --> 05:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
modifying what is in the current bill
 
05:39:37.270 --> 05:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
one of our biggest concerns is around
 
05:39:39.510 --> 05:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
the use of the word injury it's very
 
05:39:41.830 --> 05:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
vague it could include something very
 
05:39:41.840 --> 05:39:43.110 align:start position:0%
vague it could include something very
minor

05:39:43.110 --> 05:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
minor
 
05:39:43.120 --> 05:39:44.390 align:start position:0%
minor
so

05:39:44.390 --> 05:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
although the amendment now doesn't focus
 
05:39:49.030 --> 05:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
solely on dogs our recommended change
 
05:39:49.040 --> 05:39:50.230 align:start position:0%
solely on dogs our recommended change
was

05:39:50.230 --> 05:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
instead of injury to say
 
05:39:54.310 --> 05:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
if a dog
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
bites a person or causes serious bodily
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
injury to a person
 
05:40:02.070 --> 05:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
that would clarify
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
what an injury is so it couldn't just be
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
considered a scratch or some emotional
 
05:40:08.708 --> 05:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
harm from a dog that was
 
05:40:10.948 --> 05:40:10.958 align:start position:0%
barking aggressively at somebody that
 
05:40:13.510 --> 05:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
this is actually
 
05:40:15.750 --> 05:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury
 
05:40:18.628 --> 05:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
i will mention later in my testimony i
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
have a link to
 
05:40:22.070 --> 05:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
the maine statute
 
05:40:25.510 --> 05:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
instead of injury they've used an injury
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
requiring medical attention so they've
 
05:40:30.150 --> 05:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
clarified that a bit further
 
05:40:31.990 --> 05:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that could also be an appropriate
 
05:40:34.230 --> 05:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
alternative to just the use of the word
 
05:40:34.240 --> 05:40:35.910 align:start position:0%
alternative to just the use of the word
injury

05:40:35.910 --> 05:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
injury
 
05:40:39.670 --> 05:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
we also felt that knowingly the word
 
05:40:41.670 --> 05:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
knowingly should be included in here
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
there could be a case where somebody's
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
dog was off leash out of sight hurt
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
somebody returned to the person they
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
went along with their day not knowing
 
05:40:53.430 --> 05:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
that something did happen
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
so we think if the person
 
05:40:58.548 --> 05:40:58.558 align:start position:0%
knows what happened and leaves the scene
 
05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
then that would be more
 
05:41:02.708 --> 05:41:02.718 align:start position:0%
cause for action
 
05:41:05.030 --> 05:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
the last piece that we added
 
05:41:06.470 --> 05:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
and i think this was covered in the
 
05:41:09.110 --> 05:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
amendment because previously it didn't
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
mention being able to give your
 
05:41:12.548 --> 05:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
information to a police officer you had
 
05:41:14.230 --> 05:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
to give it directly to the person who
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
was injured we felt that that could put
 
05:41:18.150 --> 05:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
some people
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
in jeopardy
 
05:41:22.390 --> 05:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
or at risk and felt that it should be to
 
05:41:24.628 --> 05:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
the injured person or to a police
 
05:41:27.510 --> 05:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
officer as soon as possible so that they
 
05:41:29.990 --> 05:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
are reporting the incident and they can
 
05:41:32.470 --> 05:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
get their information to the police
 
05:41:34.548 --> 05:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
rather than necessarily handing it out
 
05:41:37.350 --> 05:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
to a person directly
 
05:41:37.360 --> 05:41:39.110 align:start position:0%
to a person directly
um

05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons for that is if this
 
05:41:42.868 --> 05:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
is a minor they probably shouldn't be
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
giving their information out to just any
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
stranger that they've had an altercation
 
05:41:51.030 --> 05:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
with and having the opportunity to
 
05:41:53.830 --> 05:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
get to a safe place tell mom and dad
 
05:41:55.590 --> 05:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
call the police give them the
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
information it can be handled properly
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:04.230 --> 05:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing and i think this might
 
05:42:06.708 --> 05:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
be covered by the amendment is if for
 
05:42:09.670 --> 05:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
the safety of the animal or the handler
 
05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
they need to leave the scene
 
05:42:13.590 --> 05:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
in a situation where
 
05:42:15.830 --> 05:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
dogs are in an altercation whether it be
 
05:42:17.990 --> 05:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
with a human or other dogs or what may
 
05:42:18.000 --> 05:42:18.788 align:start position:0%
with a human or other dogs or what may
of

05:42:18.788 --> 05:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:42:20.948 --> 05:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
whoever has instigated the situation
 
05:42:21.990 --> 05:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
with them
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
to be able to remove the dog and then
 
05:42:26.628 --> 05:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
call the police or give your information
 
05:42:28.310 --> 05:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
to the injured person
 
05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:35.830 --> 05:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned maine statute
 
05:42:37.750 --> 05:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
they had a similar incident where
 
05:42:40.390 --> 05:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
they've recently added a new statute
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
that hits on this exact
 
05:42:43.360 --> 05:42:44.868 align:start position:0%
that hits on this exact
situation

05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:42:46.948 --> 05:42:46.958 align:start position:0%
the link is here i will email this
 
05:42:48.868 --> 05:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
testimony to you as well so you can find
 
05:42:50.788 --> 05:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
it more quickly
 
05:42:52.390 --> 05:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
they do mention
 
05:42:54.628 --> 05:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
the requirement of medical attention
 
05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
they have needing to
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.310 --> 05:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
and you can take a look there but i
 
05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
think either the recommendations that
 
05:43:08.390 --> 05:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
have been proposed here addressing a few
 
05:43:10.628 --> 05:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
of those items or how they've done it in
 
05:43:10.638 --> 05:43:11.510 align:start position:0%
of those items or how they've done it in
maine

05:43:11.510 --> 05:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
maine
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
would be a better option than i think
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
the direction of the amendment even goes
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
05:43:18.548 --> 05:43:18.558 align:start position:0%
and with that i would be happy to take
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:26.310 --> 05:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
the chair would inquire with the
 
05:43:27.990 --> 05:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for your
 
05:43:30.948 --> 05:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
testimony and for taking my question
 
05:43:33.430 --> 05:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
so one of the concerns i had when i and
 
05:43:34.868 --> 05:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
i thought the motivation of this may
 
05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
have been if someone's bit by a dog they
 
05:43:36.798 --> 05:43:38.868 align:start position:0%
have been if someone's bit by a dog they
may

05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
may
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
be curious whether they should go get a
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
rabies shot or not and the way to figure
 
05:43:43.510 --> 05:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
that out would be
 
05:43:45.510 --> 05:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
having information about the dog
 
05:43:46.948 --> 05:43:46.958 align:start position:0%
but no one's brought that up yet i just
 
05:43:48.390 --> 05:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
didn't know
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
i understand the problems with as
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
drafted we can't speak of the potential
 
05:43:53.270 --> 05:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
of a different draft
 
05:43:55.910 --> 05:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
so i guess my concern is is is that a
 
05:43:58.470 --> 05:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
concern that you have about
 
05:43:59.990 --> 05:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
a member of the public who's a bit by
 
05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
dog and how they would go about
 
05:44:04.310 --> 05:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
ascertaining that information
 
05:44:06.150 --> 05:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
i would defer to law enforcement who
 
05:44:09.030 --> 05:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
probably could speak more quickly about
 
05:44:10.470 --> 05:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
the laws that are on the books in
 
05:44:13.190 --> 05:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
regards to dogs biting
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
i am pretty sure that
 
05:44:18.070 --> 05:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
that is why all dogs have licenses and
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
so that it can be looked up and if they
 
05:44:22.310 --> 05:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
were able to provide their information
 
05:44:24.470 --> 05:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement it could be confirmed
 
05:44:27.510 --> 05:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
the dog does have a active or up-to-date
 
05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
rabies and dog license to
 
05:44:36.868 --> 05:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:41.750 --> 05:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
this time we will now close the public
 
05:44:43.600 --> 05:44:44.948 align:start position:0%
this time we will now close the public
hearing

05:44:44.948 --> 05:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:59.110 --> 05:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes
 
05:45:00.470 --> 05:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me this time we're now opening
 
05:45:02.628 --> 05:45:02.638 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on house bill
 
05:45:02.638 --> 05:45:04.708 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on house bill
1282

05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
1282
 
05:45:06.230 --> 05:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
05:45:06.240 --> 05:45:07.350 align:start position:0%
relative to the
records

05:45:07.350 --> 05:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
records
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
of communication calming carriers
 
05:45:11.590 --> 05:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes
 
05:45:16.230 --> 05:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:45:45.670 --> 05:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
this bill may look uh
 
05:45:51.350 --> 05:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
vaguely familiar to you as
 
05:45:54.868 --> 05:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
there was a bill h.b 539 which this
 
05:45:57.430 --> 05:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee in the house passed
 
05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.270 --> 05:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
there it died in the senate because of
 
05:46:09.030 --> 05:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
some language um
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
preferences by the committee um they
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
needed some more clarification on
 
05:46:15.830 --> 05:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
what exactly would be
 
05:46:19.670 --> 05:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
um the exemptions the old um bill said
 
05:46:19.680 --> 05:46:20.548 align:start position:0%
um the exemptions the old um bill said
it's

05:46:20.548 --> 05:46:20.558 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:46:20.558 --> 05:46:21.590 align:start position:0%
it's
um

05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:21.600 --> 05:46:22.390 align:start position:0%
um
said

05:46:22.390 --> 05:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:46:22.400 --> 05:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
said
that

05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:25.750 --> 05:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
the uh communications shall ensure the
 
05:46:26.948 --> 05:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
customers are kept free from
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion into the private
 
05:46:30.628 --> 05:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
and personal information by requiring
 
05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
search warrant or judicially recognized
 
05:46:34.470 --> 05:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
exception to the warrant before
 
05:46:36.708 --> 05:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
providing information about the customer
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
and that language
 
05:46:44.788 --> 05:46:44.798 align:start position:0%
it was
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
criticized in the hearing as far as like
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
clarity and whether or not the
 
05:46:52.750 --> 05:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
communication carrier would know what a
 
05:46:55.110 --> 05:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
judicially recognized exception to the
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
warrant requirement would be
 
05:47:02.070 --> 05:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
um and so uh this bill seeks to do
 
05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing but clarify
 
05:47:04.558 --> 05:47:05.350 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing but clarify
in

05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
using different language so the the new
 
05:47:07.920 --> 05:47:08.948 align:start position:0%
using different language so the the new
language

05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:47:08.958 --> 05:47:09.750 align:start position:0%
language
um

05:47:09.750 --> 05:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:47:11.190 --> 05:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
says it shall
 
05:47:14.470 --> 05:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
require a valid warrant before providing
 
05:47:16.390 --> 05:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
providing a government entity with
 
05:47:18.310 --> 05:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
information on his customers unless it
 
05:47:20.548 --> 05:47:20.558 align:start position:0%
falls under the exceptions listed under
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
our current rsa 644 a3
 
05:47:26.948 --> 05:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
and so that that lists a bunch of things
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
which are already in law that people
 
05:47:32.070 --> 05:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
already understand and so that would
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
provide more clarity
 
05:47:34.798 --> 05:47:36.390 align:start position:0%
provide more clarity
and

05:47:36.390 --> 05:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:47:36.400 --> 05:47:37.510 align:start position:0%
and
so

05:47:37.510 --> 05:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
obviously the policy before this
 
05:47:39.600 --> 05:47:40.628 align:start position:0%
obviously the policy before this
committee

05:47:40.628 --> 05:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:47:42.868 --> 05:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
supported that
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
people should not be getting
 
05:47:47.990 --> 05:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
be required
 
05:47:49.590 --> 05:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
communication carriers should not be
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
required to
 
05:47:53.430 --> 05:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
give out its customers information
 
05:47:55.910 --> 05:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
without a search warrant being offered
 
05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
just a request of the
 
05:47:58.400 --> 05:47:59.350 align:start position:0%
just a request of the
um

05:47:59.350 --> 05:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:01.590 --> 05:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
ag's office
 
05:48:05.430 --> 05:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:48:08.470 --> 05:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
obviously um requiring
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
search warrants are
 
05:48:12.868 --> 05:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
are kind of fundamental to our
 
05:48:12.878 --> 05:48:16.390 align:start position:0%
are kind of fundamental to our
our

05:48:16.390 --> 05:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:19.110 --> 05:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh protections of people's rights and so
 
05:48:22.230 --> 05:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
we we definitely want to
 
05:48:24.310 --> 05:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
ensure that this
 
05:48:26.628 --> 05:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
practice of of getting information
 
05:48:28.628 --> 05:48:28.638 align:start position:0%
without a search warrant is
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
limited currently it seems uh last time
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
i did not have the
 
05:48:37.510 --> 05:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
information from the ag that responded
 
05:48:40.230 --> 05:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:43.270 --> 05:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
91 a request about these requests
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
specifically since we had a
 
05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment saying that we
 
05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
should be free from government intrusion
 
05:48:51.190 --> 05:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
into our
 
05:48:54.390 --> 05:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
private affairs and in fact what i found
 
05:48:58.310 --> 05:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
was that the ag office had requested at
 
05:49:00.390 --> 05:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
the time of the request at least
 
05:49:04.708 --> 05:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:07.510 --> 05:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
information about customers from people
 
05:49:07.520 --> 05:49:08.310 align:start position:0%
information about customers from people
from

05:49:08.310 --> 05:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%

um

05:49:13.030 --> 05:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:15.030 --> 05:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
a whole slew of different common
 
05:49:15.040 --> 05:49:16.548 align:start position:0%
a whole slew of different common
carriers

05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
05:49:18.070 --> 05:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
of information
 
05:49:21.590 --> 05:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
about their customers and these requests
 
05:49:23.510 --> 05:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
generally seem to be
 
05:49:25.830 --> 05:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
not from the ag
 
05:49:28.390 --> 05:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
they seem to be requests from local law
 
05:49:31.190 --> 05:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement requesting the information
 
05:49:34.390 --> 05:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
from the ag so all of the information
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
was not being it was requested in those
 
05:49:38.628 --> 05:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
email or in the
 
05:49:42.390 --> 05:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
the demand to comply with the ag's uh
 
05:49:45.510 --> 05:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
request for information it was not the
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
information only one time was sent back
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
to the ag's office all the information
 
05:49:51.750 --> 05:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
was always being sent down to some local
 
05:49:54.070 --> 05:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
05:49:55.750 --> 05:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
agency so
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
that is the information that i have on
 
05:49:58.080 --> 05:49:59.510 align:start position:0%
that is the information that i have on
this

05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
05:50:06.070 --> 05:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:08.708 --> 05:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized
 
05:50:10.070 --> 05:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
05:50:12.548 --> 05:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
taking my my question
 
05:50:14.548 --> 05:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
and you probably covered it already but
 
05:50:17.670 --> 05:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:19.750 --> 05:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
not here i don't know where i was
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
um do you know why
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
they who shall not be mentioned killed
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:27.600 --> 05:50:28.948 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:50:28.948 --> 05:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:31.270 --> 05:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
so i um ex
 
05:50:34.150 --> 05:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
i talked about this um language
 
05:50:35.670 --> 05:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
05:50:38.708 --> 05:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
um free from government intrusion into
 
05:50:38.718 --> 05:50:40.628 align:start position:0%
um free from government intrusion into
uh

05:50:40.628 --> 05:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:50:43.350 --> 05:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay um requiring a search warrant or a
 
05:50:45.190 --> 05:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
judicially recognized exception to the
 
05:50:47.350 --> 05:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
search warrant the senate seemed well
 
05:50:50.470 --> 05:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually it wasn't the senate it was
 
05:50:50.480 --> 05:50:51.910 align:start position:0%
actually it wasn't the senate it was
communicate

05:50:51.910 --> 05:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
05:50:53.990 --> 05:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
consolidated communication that said we
 
05:50:55.510 --> 05:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't know what that is
 
05:50:56.708 --> 05:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:50:59.590 --> 05:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
the senate also
 
05:51:01.350 --> 05:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
were concerned about emergency
 
05:51:03.430 --> 05:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
situations like if someone's a lost
 
05:51:05.190 --> 05:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
hiker or something like that that they
 
05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to get the um
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
subscriber information of their phone or
 
05:51:12.230 --> 05:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
something like that and so um in this
 
05:51:14.868 --> 05:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
rsa 644 a3
 
05:51:17.030 --> 05:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
emergencies are one of the exceptions so
 
05:51:19.590 --> 05:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
that would have addressed the issue um
 
05:51:21.750 --> 05:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
obviously emergencies are are an
 
05:51:22.868 --> 05:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
exception to
 
05:51:24.470 --> 05:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
search warrants
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
now but they just wanted to have a
 
05:51:28.788 --> 05:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
little bit more clarity on where the
 
05:51:31.030 --> 05:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
exceptions were so that that people
 
05:51:33.030 --> 05:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
could abide by the law
 
05:51:38.788 --> 05:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:40.948 --> 05:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
representative follow up thank you mr
 
05:51:42.708 --> 05:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my my
 
05:51:42.718 --> 05:51:43.830 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my my
follow-up

05:51:43.830 --> 05:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:51:43.840 --> 05:51:45.990 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

05:51:45.990 --> 05:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:48.788 --> 05:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
i know we're not in vegas but do you
 
05:51:51.670 --> 05:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:54.628 --> 05:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
you feel this new bill addresses
 
05:51:57.910 --> 05:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
the complaints of the conservatives
 
05:51:59.990 --> 05:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes i bel i believe that this
 
05:52:00.000 --> 05:52:01.670 align:start position:0%
yes i bel i believe that this
addresses

05:52:01.670 --> 05:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
05:52:03.190 --> 05:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns
 
05:52:05.430 --> 05:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the lack of clarity in the previous
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill that the senate had and so i hope
 
05:52:07.760 --> 05:52:08.390 align:start position:0%
bill that the senate had and so i hope
that

05:52:08.390 --> 05:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
you and they will be able to support it
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:52:19.830 --> 05:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:21.430 --> 05:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
05:52:26.470 --> 05:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:28.628 --> 05:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
the committee now calls senior assistant
 
05:52:31.110 --> 05:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
attorney general ben agadi from the
 
05:52:40.948 --> 05:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:42.390 --> 05:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and good afternoon
 
05:52:44.948 --> 05:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
everyone um i'm here from the department
 
05:52:46.948 --> 05:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
of justice again uh my name is benjamin
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
gotti i'm a senior assistant attorney
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
general in the criminal justice bureau
 
05:52:52.150 --> 05:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
our office is not taking a position with
 
05:52:53.670 --> 05:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill at this time but we
 
05:52:55.110 --> 05:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we were present
 
05:52:56.628 --> 05:52:56.638 align:start position:0%
so we could answer any questions that
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
anyone in the committee may have i've
 
05:53:00.150 --> 05:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to look at the bill
 
05:53:01.270 --> 05:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
for a little bit do a little bit of
 
05:53:03.190 --> 05:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
background research and i just stand
 
05:53:04.628 --> 05:53:04.638 align:start position:0%
here ready to answer any questions
 
05:53:07.510 --> 05:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:14.548 --> 05:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:53:16.310 --> 05:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
this goes to
 
05:53:19.350 --> 05:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
the point i'm glad you're here
 
05:53:21.590 --> 05:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
as i understand it the reason for this
 
05:53:26.470 --> 05:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:28.470 --> 05:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcements
 
05:53:30.070 --> 05:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
do not have the knowledge that they need
 
05:53:32.310 --> 05:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
to get a warrant to do some of these
 
05:53:34.310 --> 05:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
inquiries and they're just doing it
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
my apologies is that better i'm sorry
 
05:53:49.510 --> 05:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
about that um i don't know if that they
 
05:53:51.750 --> 05:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
they should know certainly that any time
 
05:53:53.910 --> 05:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
that you are seeking to get content of
 
05:53:57.110 --> 05:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
an individual's um account record and so
 
05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about
 
05:54:01.750 --> 05:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
again actual content of somebody's
 
05:54:03.670 --> 05:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
accounts or records then they certainly
 
05:54:05.190 --> 05:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
should be getting a search warrant and
 
05:54:07.670 --> 05:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
that's the current standard now that all
 
05:54:09.830 --> 05:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement operates the vast
 
05:54:12.230 --> 05:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
majority of the requests that we get are
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
from primarily from new hampshire's
 
05:54:16.470 --> 05:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
internet crimes against children task
 
05:54:18.470 --> 05:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
force i'd probably say 60 to 70 percent
 
05:54:21.190 --> 05:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
of the ones that we do and um
 
05:54:22.708 --> 05:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
a former speaker representative was
 
05:54:24.470 --> 05:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct in terms of uh
 
05:54:29.110 --> 05:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
between 2018 and 2000 2021 i believe
 
05:54:31.270 --> 05:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
from januaries of those dates i believe
 
05:54:34.628 --> 05:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
we did around 41 to 43 of those requests
 
05:54:36.628 --> 05:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
again about 60 to 70 percent are
 
05:54:39.430 --> 05:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
internet crimes against children
 
05:54:41.270 --> 05:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
there's a smaller majority that are drug
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
cases and quite frankly i really don't
 
05:54:44.548 --> 05:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
have any personal knowledge of any other
 
05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
cases but it's usually a
 
05:54:50.548 --> 05:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
76b subpoena that when it is issued
 
05:54:53.270 --> 05:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
inevitably leads to the search warrant
 
05:54:54.868 --> 05:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
being issued because
 
05:54:57.270 --> 05:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
you can't get content with a 76b all you
 
05:54:59.990 --> 05:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
can do i do is identify the individual
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
name that is attached to that particular
 
05:55:03.750 --> 05:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
account or the digital phone number
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's attached to that account
 
05:55:07.910 --> 05:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
the vast majority and pardon me just for
 
05:55:09.350 --> 05:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
a second i know it can be long-winded
 
05:55:11.910 --> 05:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i apologize but to explain how most
 
05:55:13.910 --> 05:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
of those cases come in
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
it's even a process people in my office
 
05:55:18.230 --> 05:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
not in the criminal bureau are not
 
05:55:19.670 --> 05:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
05:55:21.510 --> 05:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
often we will get a cyber tip that will
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
come in and that will go to the icac
 
05:55:26.470 --> 05:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
task force and then that goes to one of
 
05:55:28.628 --> 05:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
the local catchment agencies that has an
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
icac officer assigned
 
05:55:32.948 --> 05:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
they then contact us if they feel that
 
05:55:35.030 --> 05:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
there is reasonable belief
 
05:55:37.110 --> 05:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
to believe that you have a
 
05:55:39.110 --> 05:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
the common communications common carrier
 
05:55:41.350 --> 05:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
is being used in the commission of or
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
about to be or wasn't a crime and they
 
05:55:45.430 --> 05:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
will ask for our assistance for a 76b
 
05:55:47.110 --> 05:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
subpoena to find out
 
05:55:47.120 --> 05:55:47.910 align:start position:0%
subpoena to find out
who

05:55:47.910 --> 05:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:55:50.070 --> 05:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
is registered as the owner of this ip
 
05:55:50.080 --> 05:55:51.350 align:start position:0%
is registered as the owner of this ip
address

05:55:51.350 --> 05:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
address
 
05:55:53.990 --> 05:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that's i mean it's very clear in the
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
statute it's a very limited information
 
05:55:57.110 --> 05:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's available
 
05:55:59.190 --> 05:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
that then leads them to develop the case
 
05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
to either
 
05:56:02.708 --> 05:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
find that somebody may be in fact guilty
 
05:56:05.750 --> 05:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
or innocent and lead to a search warrant
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
the only case that i can think of myself
 
05:56:09.190 --> 05:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
that i've done i've been here for about
 
05:56:10.948 --> 05:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
17 years
 
05:56:12.628 --> 05:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
has only been one that was involved with
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
a homicide case and it turns out that
 
05:56:16.230 --> 05:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
when we did the 76b subpoena we were
 
05:56:18.948 --> 05:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
able to show that the individual ip
 
05:56:21.190 --> 05:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
address was somebody that didn't have a
 
05:56:23.590 --> 05:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
protected wi-fi there were 20 or 30
 
05:56:24.788 --> 05:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
other residents in the building that
 
05:56:26.390 --> 05:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
could have all been using their signal
 
05:56:28.628 --> 05:56:28.638 align:start position:0%
so it was used really to exonerate an
 
05:56:30.150 --> 05:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
individual rather than find that they're
 
05:56:30.160 --> 05:56:31.350 align:start position:0%
individual rather than find that they're
guilty

05:56:31.350 --> 05:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
guilty
 
05:56:33.510 --> 05:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
to most address directly address the
 
05:56:35.830 --> 05:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
question i think that law enforcement
 
05:56:37.270 --> 05:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
should certainly know that if you want
 
05:56:38.788 --> 05:56:38.798 align:start position:0%
any sort of content you have to get a
 
05:56:39.990 --> 05:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
search warrant that's the law as it
 
05:56:41.670 --> 05:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
stands right now
 
05:56:44.708 --> 05:56:44.718 align:start position:0%
76b's are primarily used as a tool to
 
05:56:46.708 --> 05:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
get the investigation started to just
 
05:56:48.310 --> 05:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
say are we looking in the right area
 
05:56:49.830 --> 05:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
without going into an individual's
 
05:56:49.840 --> 05:56:52.070 align:start position:0%
without going into an individual's
content

05:56:52.070 --> 05:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
content
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:56:53.040 --> 05:56:55.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
welcome

05:56:55.030 --> 05:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
05:56:56.310 --> 05:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for testimony the chair can
 
05:56:57.990 --> 05:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
inquire of a question
 
05:56:59.350 --> 05:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:56:59.360 --> 05:57:01.030 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you for taking my
question

05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:57:02.470 --> 05:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the term reasonable
 
05:57:02.480 --> 05:57:03.830 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the term reasonable
suspicion

05:57:03.830 --> 05:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
suspicion
 
05:57:03.840 --> 05:57:04.868 align:start position:0%
suspicion
and

05:57:04.868 --> 05:57:04.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:07.030 --> 05:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
i presume it says a valid search warrant
 
05:57:07.040 --> 05:57:07.830 align:start position:0%
i presume it says a valid search warrant
that's

05:57:07.830 --> 05:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:57:09.030 --> 05:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't say but it's referring to
 
05:57:10.628 --> 05:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
05:57:11.910 --> 05:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
can you exp
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
explain i guess that
 
05:57:16.390 --> 05:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
what would what would happen if if that
 
05:57:17.830 --> 05:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
standard was a probable cause
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
requirement as opposed to reasonable
 
05:57:21.990 --> 05:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
suspicion that changed eye taxability
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
how much would that change in the
 
05:57:25.750 --> 05:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the real world
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the practical sense the the court
 
05:57:29.110 --> 05:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
does draw a distinction between
 
05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion and probable cause
 
05:57:33.270 --> 05:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
and that's been standard both when you
 
05:57:34.628 --> 05:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
look at this from a federal
 
05:57:36.548 --> 05:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights that we all have
 
05:57:37.910 --> 05:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
or the rights that we have under the new
 
05:57:40.708 --> 05:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution um there so the
 
05:57:42.628 --> 05:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
court does draw some distinction but
 
05:57:44.868 --> 05:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
what's uh great about many judicial
 
05:57:46.150 --> 05:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
decisions is of course it doesn't say
 
05:57:48.230 --> 05:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what that distinction is so
 
05:57:49.990 --> 05:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
you're still looking at it being whether
 
05:57:51.910 --> 05:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
it is more reasonable or not or the
 
05:57:53.750 --> 05:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
court will say is it more probable none
 
05:57:56.150 --> 05:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
and each time the court will always say
 
05:57:57.830 --> 05:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
we will use a totality of the
 
05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances test we will look at all
 
05:58:01.750 --> 05:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
of the circumstances when we know and
 
05:58:03.590 --> 05:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
find whether it's again either more
 
05:58:05.510 --> 05:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable or more probable
 
05:58:08.230 --> 05:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
but better that i can't really define
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
what that standard is better than that
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
because the court won't define what that
 
05:58:16.788 --> 05:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:20.390 --> 05:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:22.230 --> 05:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question as a
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
practical matter when it comes to these
 
05:58:23.760 --> 05:58:26.548 align:start position:0%
practical matter when it comes to these
investigations

05:58:26.548 --> 05:58:26.558 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
to what extent would it be an additional
 
05:58:31.190 --> 05:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
burden on the attorney general's office
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
to have to go through
 
05:58:35.670 --> 05:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
a a process of securing a warrant for
 
05:58:35.680 --> 05:58:36.868 align:start position:0%
a a process of securing a warrant for
this

05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:58:39.510 --> 05:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
for this type of information is this
 
05:58:41.430 --> 05:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
not a big deal are there time issues
 
05:58:41.440 --> 05:58:43.110 align:start position:0%
not a big deal are there time issues
involved

05:58:43.110 --> 05:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
is there a problem
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
i would answer that by saying that there
 
05:58:48.548 --> 05:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
are certainly some time issues that are
 
05:58:50.070 --> 05:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
naturally going to be involved in that
 
05:58:52.948 --> 05:58:52.958 align:start position:0%
process um so to give everybody kind of
 
05:58:54.390 --> 05:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
an understanding of what time issues
 
05:58:55.670 --> 05:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
look like now
 
05:58:57.510 --> 05:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
when one of those cyber tips comes in
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
and it gets to the right investigator
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
who then says this could have grounds
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
for a 76b let's find out who this ip
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
address is
 
05:59:08.070 --> 05:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
that phone call can be made and we can
 
05:59:09.990 --> 05:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
probably after we review it because
 
05:59:11.910 --> 05:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
again there does have to be that
 
05:59:13.750 --> 05:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable suspicion that it's there and
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
we have to check that before we even
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
think about writing one of these up
 
05:59:18.868 --> 05:59:18.878 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a process that may
 
05:59:21.590 --> 05:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
take an hour or two a search warrant
 
05:59:22.948 --> 05:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
process is naturally going to be a
 
05:59:25.110 --> 05:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
little bit longer you have to be able to
 
05:59:26.470 --> 05:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
submit the search warrant you're also
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to it also depends on the
 
05:59:29.430 --> 05:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
time of day
 
05:59:31.270 --> 05:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
an assistant attorney general is usually
 
05:59:33.830 --> 05:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
available 24 7 for law enforcement all
 
05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
they have to do is usually call one of
 
05:59:37.510 --> 05:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
our cell phones in order to do a search
 
05:59:38.868 --> 05:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
warrant instead
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
if it's daytime in superior court where
 
05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
most of these offenses
 
05:59:44.390 --> 05:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
crimes against children child
 
05:59:46.470 --> 05:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
pornography drug offenses most of those
 
05:59:47.750 --> 05:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
are felonies so they have to be in
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
superior court that's pulling a judge
 
05:59:51.670 --> 05:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
off the bench to be able to make that
 
05:59:53.830 --> 05:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
decision or trying to get the nighttime
 
05:59:53.840 --> 05:59:54.948 align:start position:0%
decision or trying to get the nighttime
judge

05:59:54.948 --> 05:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
judge
 
05:59:56.788 --> 05:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
you have less control over what the
 
05:59:58.548 --> 05:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
timeline of that would be
 
06:00:00.628 --> 06:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
and with most of the icac references
 
06:00:02.230 --> 06:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
that we get there's a question of
 
06:00:03.910 --> 06:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a child that is
 
06:00:05.750 --> 06:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
currently or in the immediate past in
 
06:00:07.350 --> 06:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
danger and that's one of the other
 
06:00:09.750 --> 06:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why when you ask about delay
 
06:00:11.190 --> 06:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
there would be some delay that would
 
06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
come with regards to doing a search
 
06:00:12.958 --> 06:00:15.030 align:start position:0%
come with regards to doing a search
warrant

06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
06:00:17.350 --> 06:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
but again it would not have content so
 
06:00:18.868 --> 06:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
you can't get any content with these
 
06:00:20.230 --> 06:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative muse recognized for
 
06:00:20.240 --> 06:00:21.670 align:start position:0%
representative muse recognized for
follow-up

06:00:21.670 --> 06:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:00:24.390 --> 06:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up um
 
06:00:26.310 --> 06:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
in cases like this
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
how important is it to act
 
06:00:29.040 --> 06:00:30.310 align:start position:0%
how important is it to act
uh

06:00:30.310 --> 06:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:00:30.320 --> 06:00:31.270 align:start position:0%
uh
quickly

06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
06:00:31.280 --> 06:00:32.948 align:start position:0%
quickly
versus

06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
versus
 
06:00:32.958 --> 06:00:34.070 align:start position:0%
versus
acting

06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
acting
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
with confidence that you're
 
06:00:38.230 --> 06:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
basically dotting all the i's and
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
i would say the second one is more
 
06:00:46.070 --> 06:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
important it's crossing the t's and are
 
06:00:47.430 --> 06:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
dying in the eyes and crossing the t's
 
06:00:49.750 --> 06:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's more important there has to be
 
06:00:51.910 --> 06:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
for example one one of these comes in
 
06:00:54.230 --> 06:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
each one of us in our office
 
06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
writes up a memo that's that's kept
 
06:00:55.920 --> 06:00:57.110 align:start position:0%
writes up a memo that's that's kept
in-house

06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
in-house
 
06:00:59.830 --> 06:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
that understands what the facts were for
 
06:01:01.590 --> 06:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
us to have a basis to be able to issue
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
this letter um
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think one thing that many people don't
 
06:01:06.788 --> 06:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
understand about prosecutors whether
 
06:01:09.190 --> 06:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
it's in our office or county-wide is to
 
06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
say we actually say no a lot more than
 
06:01:12.470 --> 06:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
we say yes
 
06:01:15.270 --> 06:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
and here um
 
06:01:16.628 --> 06:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's more important to make sure that
 
06:01:19.350 --> 06:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
you have it right just as much as
 
06:01:20.868 --> 06:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
finding the guilty protecting the
 
06:01:22.548 --> 06:01:22.558 align:start position:0%
innocent um
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
having it right is more important than
 
06:01:24.000 --> 06:01:25.350 align:start position:0%
having it right is more important than
expediency

06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
expediency
 
06:01:27.510 --> 06:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
one final follow-up
 
06:01:29.430 --> 06:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
and would you say that having a warrant
 
06:01:31.270 --> 06:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
in this situation would help you do that
 
06:01:33.190 --> 06:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
more effectively
 
06:01:34.948 --> 06:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
i think having a warrant in this
 
06:01:36.788 --> 06:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
situation it depends on the material
 
06:01:39.430 --> 06:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
that we have um i think here you have a
 
06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
standard that yes you're looking at here
 
06:01:42.868 --> 06:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
for reasonable suspicion that the the
 
06:01:44.948 --> 06:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
communications common carrier has been
 
06:01:48.390 --> 06:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
used in the commission of a crime um
 
06:01:50.708 --> 06:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
it's often
 
06:01:52.948 --> 06:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
most of these will lead to a warrant
 
06:01:54.628 --> 06:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
once you're seeking an individual's
 
06:01:54.638 --> 06:01:56.070 align:start position:0%
once you're seeking an individual's
content

06:01:56.070 --> 06:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
content
 
06:01:57.910 --> 06:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
it has to be that way it's the right
 
06:01:59.510 --> 06:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
thing to do in that case
 
06:02:02.390 --> 06:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
but in that balance of time and crossing
 
06:02:05.110 --> 06:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
the t's and dotting the eyes
 
06:02:07.430 --> 06:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
having the appropriate medium between
 
06:02:10.150 --> 06:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
meeting both of those needs 76bs
 
06:02:10.160 --> 06:02:11.750 align:start position:0%
meeting both of those needs 76bs
currently

06:02:11.750 --> 06:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
currently
 
06:02:13.270 --> 06:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
tends to do that but certainly when it
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
comes to the icat cases
 
06:02:20.788 --> 06:02:20.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:25.110 --> 06:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:27.350 --> 06:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you may have mentioned this in
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony i haven't picked it up
 
06:02:31.670 --> 06:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
or understood it completely
 
06:02:34.310 --> 06:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
um this the way this law is written it
 
06:02:37.030 --> 06:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
repeals a section and then uh and then
 
06:02:39.190 --> 06:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
reenacts it as written and it makes it
 
06:02:41.110 --> 06:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult to understand the
 
06:02:42.868 --> 06:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
06:02:45.270 --> 06:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
the reinstruct the uh
 
06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
the reenacted language and the language
 
06:02:50.390 --> 06:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
that was appealed could you just briefly
 
06:02:54.150 --> 06:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
comment on on what effect this has
 
06:02:57.910 --> 06:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:59.190 --> 06:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
certainly i'm
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
sorry let me just make him try by the
 
06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:03.760 --> 06:03:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
essentially

06:03:05.190 --> 06:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
06:03:07.910 --> 06:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at the two side by side
 
06:03:10.470 --> 06:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
you can read through subsections
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
i believe it's we're looking at roman
 
06:03:14.548 --> 06:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
one sections a through f are are
 
06:03:14.558 --> 06:03:15.830 align:start position:0%
one sections a through f are are
identical

06:03:15.830 --> 06:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
identical
 
06:03:18.390 --> 06:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
between the two statutes so essentially
 
06:03:21.430 --> 06:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
it it takes the current law of what's in
 
06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
place that would allow this written
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
administrative subpoena process
 
06:03:27.350 --> 06:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
and it
 
06:03:29.590 --> 06:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
stops that it ceases it and so for those
 
06:03:31.830 --> 06:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
same sets of information that currently
 
06:03:33.510 --> 06:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
an administrative subpoena would be
 
06:03:35.830 --> 06:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
available for now it must be done via
 
06:03:42.548 --> 06:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:49.750 --> 06:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
not knowing the difference between a
 
06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
search warrant and an administrative
 
06:03:53.670 --> 06:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
warrant is one simpler one easier one
 
06:03:55.990 --> 06:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
more effective one less effective or how
 
06:03:57.350 --> 06:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
what what
 
06:03:59.270 --> 06:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments about that
 
06:04:01.510 --> 06:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
um sure an administrative warrant when
 
06:04:03.910 --> 06:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's issued from our office is uh very
 
06:04:05.830 --> 06:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
very simple it's a it's a document that
 
06:04:07.350 --> 06:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
would come out let's say on letterhead
 
06:04:09.270 --> 06:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
it would be signed by an authorized and
 
06:04:11.350 --> 06:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
trained assistant attorney general there
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
is a training process that they have to
 
06:04:13.910 --> 06:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
go through
 
06:04:15.590 --> 06:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
not just every attorney in my office has
 
06:04:17.750 --> 06:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to issue these they have to
 
06:04:19.510 --> 06:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
know again what they're looking for be
 
06:04:21.270 --> 06:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
able to appropriately write
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
the in-house memo and say that they can
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
find that reasonable suspicion is there
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
the process of issuing that it looks
 
06:04:28.948 --> 06:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
almost like a letter
 
06:04:31.510 --> 06:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's puts the statute in it and so that
 
06:04:34.230 --> 06:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
the receiving company understands what
 
06:04:35.190 --> 06:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
a search warrant on the other hand
 
06:04:39.350 --> 06:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to require a submission of
 
06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
an affidavit that has to get written by
 
06:04:43.430 --> 06:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
the investigator not by an attorney
 
06:04:45.510 --> 06:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
that then needs to be submitted to the
 
06:04:48.230 --> 06:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
court there is a whole process to do
 
06:04:49.910 --> 06:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
that both in the district and superior
 
06:04:51.750 --> 06:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
court usually with an application that
 
06:04:53.270 --> 06:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
comes in potentially also with the
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
motion to seal with regards to the
 
06:04:57.030 --> 06:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
nature of the investigation
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
and then that has to get approved by the
 
06:05:00.310 --> 06:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
court they will issue
 
06:05:02.070 --> 06:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
the warrant it's a one-page document
 
06:05:04.150 --> 06:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
that comes out signed and certified and
 
06:05:06.230 --> 06:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
then eventually a return has to be filed
 
06:05:08.070 --> 06:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
with the court so administrative
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
subpoena is essentially a two-page
 
06:05:11.830 --> 06:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
document that would come out of our
 
06:05:14.390 --> 06:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
office looks a lot like a letter
 
06:05:16.948 --> 06:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
a warrant itself would involve a
 
06:05:19.030 --> 06:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
submission of a multiple page affidavit
 
06:05:21.270 --> 06:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
to the court a warrant application a
 
06:05:22.868 --> 06:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
warrant that issues and then a return
 
06:05:24.150 --> 06:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
that has to get filed back with the
 
06:05:25.910 --> 06:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
court once the company provides the
 
06:05:27.670 --> 06:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
information i hope that answers the
 
06:05:27.680 --> 06:05:30.708 align:start position:0%
information i hope that answers the
question

06:05:30.708 --> 06:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:32.070 --> 06:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative newman recognized for a
 
06:05:32.080 --> 06:05:33.350 align:start position:0%
representative newman recognized for a
follow-up

06:05:33.350 --> 06:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
06:05:34.948 --> 06:05:34.958 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:05:39.110 --> 06:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
those two things they both have the same
 
06:05:40.948 --> 06:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
do they do they both have the same
 
06:05:42.868 --> 06:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
effect that you can start your
 
06:05:44.628 --> 06:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
investigation and get the same type of
 
06:05:47.030 --> 06:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
information as a result of either one of
 
06:05:48.390 --> 06:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
those right now
 
06:05:50.310 --> 06:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
they will not not right now because this
 
06:05:52.788 --> 06:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
isn't enacted yet
 
06:05:54.310 --> 06:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
so if i just want to make sure if i can
 
06:05:55.590 --> 06:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
clarify that i'm understanding the
 
06:05:58.150 --> 06:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
question correctly so that
 
06:05:58.160 --> 06:05:59.110 align:start position:0%
question correctly so that
can

06:05:59.110 --> 06:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:06:01.270 --> 06:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
can the same information be obtained
 
06:06:03.430 --> 06:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
under the current standard versus the
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:09.430 --> 06:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:06:09.440 --> 06:06:10.788 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

06:06:10.788 --> 06:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:12.548 --> 06:06:12.558 align:start position:0%
yeah you gave a description about what
 
06:06:14.708 --> 06:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
you get from from using this with the
 
06:06:16.310 --> 06:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
search warrant and you could start an
 
06:06:18.070 --> 06:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
investigation and you explained a lot of
 
06:06:19.750 --> 06:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
things to it
 
06:06:20.830 --> 06:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
with an
 
06:06:23.430 --> 06:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
administrative warrant could you also
 
06:06:26.470 --> 06:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
get that same information or is it
 
06:06:28.230 --> 06:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
lesser less information do you get a
 
06:06:29.590 --> 06:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
more information is there what's the
 
06:06:31.110 --> 06:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
difference between the two i understand
 
06:06:33.590 --> 06:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
i understand um there's a there's a very
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
large difference between what's
 
06:06:37.590 --> 06:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
available now under the statute versus
 
06:06:39.030 --> 06:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
if you were to choose to do a search
 
06:06:40.788 --> 06:06:40.798 align:start position:0%
warrant right now
 
06:06:42.788 --> 06:06:42.798 align:start position:0%
if you were to choose to do a search
 
06:06:42.798 --> 06:06:44.070 align:start position:0%
if you were to choose to do a search
warrant

06:06:44.070 --> 06:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
06:06:45.270 --> 06:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
for example
 
06:06:47.590 --> 06:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
and i did bring an example with me a
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
matter that was submitted to our office
 
06:06:51.750 --> 06:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
just last in in september
 
06:06:51.760 --> 06:06:52.628 align:start position:0%
just last in in september
where

06:06:52.628 --> 06:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:06:54.470 --> 06:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
facebook alerted us that there were two
 
06:06:56.070 --> 06:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
images of underage children that they
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
believed violated child pornography laws
 
06:07:00.548 --> 06:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
06:07:01.910 --> 06:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
for us
 
06:07:04.470 --> 06:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
once that cyber tip comes in
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
we could now under the statute as it is
 
06:07:07.680 --> 06:07:08.788 align:start position:0%
we could now under the statute as it is
written

06:07:08.788 --> 06:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:07:10.708 --> 06:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
do an administrative subpoena to find
 
06:07:10.718 --> 06:07:11.590 align:start position:0%
do an administrative subpoena to find
out

06:07:11.590 --> 06:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
the registered name or the email address
 
06:07:16.868 --> 06:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
that goes along with that facebook page
 
06:07:18.470 --> 06:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then the investigation could start
 
06:07:20.470 --> 06:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
from there we would be very limited in
 
06:07:23.030 --> 06:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
what we were able to find out we would
 
06:07:25.190 --> 06:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
be able to find out
 
06:07:25.200 --> 06:07:27.910 align:start position:0%
be able to find out
specifically

06:07:27.910 --> 06:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
06:07:29.910 --> 06:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
the email address that they've used to
 
06:07:32.070 --> 06:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
create that account a phone number that
 
06:07:34.390 --> 06:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
they use to create that account
 
06:07:36.310 --> 06:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
and that is essentially it if it was a
 
06:07:38.628 --> 06:07:38.638 align:start position:0%
phone number reporting we could find out
 
06:07:41.030 --> 06:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
um the name of the person that owns the
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
phone number or the ip address that's
 
06:07:45.670 --> 06:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
all that's really available under the
 
06:07:47.670 --> 06:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
current 76b
 
06:07:49.510 --> 06:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
if we were to do a search warrant right
 
06:07:51.750 --> 06:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
now for that let's say we that would
 
06:07:53.830 --> 06:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
allow us to now
 
06:07:53.840 --> 06:07:54.948 align:start position:0%
allow us to now
obtain

06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
06:07:56.310 --> 06:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
copies of everything that's in that
 
06:07:58.230 --> 06:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
person's facebook account look at the
 
06:07:59.830 --> 06:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
photos look at their text messages look
 
06:08:02.230 --> 06:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
at their posts potentially as long as
 
06:08:05.110 --> 06:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
reasonably tied to what we believe is
 
06:08:07.190 --> 06:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
the infraction that's occurred the crime
 
06:08:08.708 --> 06:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
that's occurred
 
06:08:10.628 --> 06:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
if you were to seek to get into the
 
06:08:12.470 --> 06:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
facebook and we believe these two photos
 
06:08:14.230 --> 06:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
are there a search warrant would allow
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
us to go in look at the facebook see if
 
06:08:19.030 --> 06:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
those two photos are there and find out
 
06:08:21.030 --> 06:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
discussions back and forth about those
 
06:08:23.190 --> 06:08:23.200 align:start position:0%
photos we couldn't willy nilly grab
 
06:08:24.708 --> 06:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
everything that's there that wouldn't be
 
06:08:26.230 --> 06:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
proper because we don't have probable
 
06:08:27.510 --> 06:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
cause to believe that the other things
 
06:08:29.590 --> 06:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
on that page are evidence of a crime we
 
06:08:30.868 --> 06:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
can only go in and get what's evidence
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
of a crime but we could not get any sort
 
06:08:35.990 --> 06:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
of content we can't right now under the
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
76b law as it's written only to find out
 
06:08:41.030 --> 06:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
who the individual is
 
06:08:42.708 --> 06:08:42.718 align:start position:0%
and then that would have to lead to more
 
06:08:45.110 --> 06:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
investigation to possibly get a search
 
06:08:46.230 --> 06:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
warrant which
 
06:08:49.110 --> 06:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:53.830 --> 06:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative true you recognized
 
06:08:58.868 --> 06:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chan
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for my uh for taking my
 
06:09:00.638 --> 06:09:05.830 align:start position:0%
thank you for my uh for taking my
question

06:09:08.230 --> 06:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
with the bill becoming law let's
 
06:09:10.948 --> 06:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
assume that the communications carry is
 
06:09:13.350 --> 06:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
not liable for giving you
 
06:09:16.390 --> 06:09:16.400 align:start position:0%

what if
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
a local
 
06:09:25.270 --> 06:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement agency
 
06:09:28.230 --> 06:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
said uh called up say hey zucky it's

06:09:35.670 --> 06:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh my name
 
06:09:37.750 --> 06:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
no not me him
 
06:09:39.510 --> 06:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
my name my address they give all this
 
06:09:42.230 --> 06:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:44.868 --> 06:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
because they you know he's calling in a
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
favor or whatever
 
06:09:49.350 --> 06:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
what's the penalty
 
06:09:51.190 --> 06:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
for them doing that
 
06:09:54.230 --> 06:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
so in in an action like that and and i
 
06:09:56.070 --> 06:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
can only speak to it from my own
 
06:09:57.990 --> 06:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint of being a prosecutor so if
 
06:10:00.310 --> 06:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
that case were to come to me and i find
 
06:10:03.030 --> 06:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
out that the local law enforcement
 
06:10:05.510 --> 06:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
officer did not properly get if assuming
 
06:10:06.868 --> 06:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
that this change were to go through if
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
you choose to do that
 
06:10:10.150 --> 06:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
and they did not get a search warrant
 
06:10:11.990 --> 06:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
for it most likely what that means is
 
06:10:13.830 --> 06:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
that any evidence that was gathered as a
 
06:10:15.430 --> 06:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
result of that the information that he
 
06:10:15.440 --> 06:10:16.310 align:start position:0%
result of that the information that he
learned

06:10:16.310 --> 06:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
learned
 
06:10:17.910 --> 06:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the fruit of the poisonous tree
 
06:10:19.510 --> 06:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
doctrine which would be any information
 
06:10:21.750 --> 06:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
he learns from that information
 
06:10:22.708 --> 06:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
would be
 
06:10:24.470 --> 06:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
suppressed we would not be able to use
 
06:10:28.230 --> 06:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:29.510 --> 06:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized
 
06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up thank you mr chair thank
 
06:10:32.628 --> 06:10:32.638 align:start position:0%
you again
 
06:10:32.638 --> 06:10:33.430 align:start position:0%
you again
um

06:10:33.430 --> 06:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:33.440 --> 06:10:34.548 align:start position:0%
um
yes

06:10:34.548 --> 06:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:10:34.558 --> 06:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
yes
so

06:10:35.750 --> 06:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:10:35.760 --> 06:10:37.510 align:start position:0%
so
but

06:10:37.510 --> 06:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:10:39.590 --> 06:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
i can't say my good name is first
 
06:10:40.868 --> 06:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
because i've been charged with a
 
06:10:43.190 --> 06:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
horrible climb but that information is
 
06:10:44.868 --> 06:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
now out
 
06:10:47.910 --> 06:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
in my town that's the guy
 
06:10:49.750 --> 06:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't do anything to him
 
06:10:53.350 --> 06:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
but everyone knows i'm the guy
 
06:10:53.360 --> 06:10:54.708 align:start position:0%
but everyone knows i'm the guy
would

06:10:54.708 --> 06:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:10:57.430 --> 06:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
would you bring a communications
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
company to court would you
 
06:11:00.830 --> 06:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
would i have to
 
06:11:04.948 --> 06:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
sue oh i see you mean for the for
 
06:11:06.628 --> 06:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't a protection that was
 
06:11:08.470 --> 06:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
written into the statue
 
06:11:08.480 --> 06:11:09.830 align:start position:0%
written into the statue
um

06:11:09.830 --> 06:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:11.830 --> 06:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh that is something that
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
the ag's office would pursue
 
06:11:14.868 --> 06:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's going to be
 
06:11:16.788 --> 06:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
something outside of my bail wick that's
 
06:11:18.230 --> 06:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
going to be upstairs in the civil bureau
 
06:11:19.350 --> 06:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to be much better to be
 
06:11:21.990 --> 06:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
able to answer that um
 
06:11:23.750 --> 06:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
as i as i frequently say to a lot of
 
06:11:25.110 --> 06:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
victims families that i might work with
 
06:11:26.230 --> 06:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
there's always a difference between i
 
06:11:27.510 --> 06:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't know and i can't tell you and this
 
06:11:29.190 --> 06:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
is an answer well i don't know that
 
06:11:30.470 --> 06:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
would have to be a decision probably
 
06:11:36.150 --> 06:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:37.670 --> 06:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question again so
 
06:11:43.830 --> 06:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
to to to basically try to sum up part of
 
06:11:45.350 --> 06:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
this conversation and i want to make
 
06:11:47.670 --> 06:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
sure i'm summing it up accurately
 
06:11:47.680 --> 06:11:48.470 align:start position:0%
sure i'm summing it up accurately
but

06:11:48.470 --> 06:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:11:50.548 --> 06:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
the current process is for you to obtain
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
an administrative warrant
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
which is fairly easy for your office to
 
06:11:57.910 --> 06:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
do fairly easy for your office to get
 
06:11:59.830 --> 06:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
a search warrant though would have a a
 
06:12:01.830 --> 06:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
much wider scope
 
06:12:03.830 --> 06:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
so particu so one of the things that
 
06:12:06.070 --> 06:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
occurs to me and and
 
06:12:08.230 --> 06:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
i'd appreciate you just letting me know
 
06:12:09.990 --> 06:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
if this is true or nada
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
because a search warrant has a much
 
06:12:14.150 --> 06:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
wider scope
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's potential for a lot more
 
06:12:18.310 --> 06:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
personal information to be found and
 
06:12:21.350 --> 06:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
disclosed through that process correct
 
06:12:24.310 --> 06:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct the 76b as it's written
 
06:12:24.320 --> 06:12:25.030 align:start position:0%
that's correct the 76b as it's written
and

06:12:25.030 --> 06:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:26.868 --> 06:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
and when i say as it's written or if you
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
choose to adopt this when we're looking
 
06:12:31.270 --> 06:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
at that that subsections a through f
 
06:12:34.310 --> 06:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
that those pieces of information are
 
06:12:35.590 --> 06:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
very what we would consider very very
 
06:12:37.990 --> 06:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
simple business records um that a person
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
has chosen to sign up with facebook or
 
06:12:42.070 --> 06:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
chosen to sign up
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
with verizon and have service
 
06:12:46.230 --> 06:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
that is
 
06:12:47.910 --> 06:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
again very basic business record
 
06:12:47.920 --> 06:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
again very basic business record
information

06:12:49.350 --> 06:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:12:49.360 --> 06:12:50.470 align:start position:0%
information
no

06:12:50.470 --> 06:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:12:53.350 --> 06:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
real private information and no content
 
06:12:55.110 --> 06:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
is available through
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
the seven six seven six b process as
 
06:13:00.070 --> 06:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's written now um and it would change
 
06:13:01.670 --> 06:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
to get that stuff now you have to go
 
06:13:04.470 --> 06:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
through a search warrant and if this
 
06:13:06.548 --> 06:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
change were enacted that would still be
 
06:13:08.470 --> 06:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
true you would still have to go and get
 
06:13:10.310 --> 06:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
through a search warrant so for example
 
06:13:12.628 --> 06:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
you and i think this might best answer
 
06:13:13.670 --> 06:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
06:13:16.230 --> 06:13:16.240 align:start position:0%
things that are not available under a
 
06:13:18.708 --> 06:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
76b right now
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
you would not be able to find out when a
 
06:13:23.590 --> 06:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
person logged onto or off of the service
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
you would not be able to find out the
 
06:13:27.590 --> 06:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
websites that they visited using that
 
06:13:29.750 --> 06:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
service you couldn't find out who they
 
06:13:31.590 --> 06:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
emailed you could not find out who
 
06:13:34.310 --> 06:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
emailed them
 
06:13:36.230 --> 06:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
you couldn't find any sort of content of
 
06:13:38.310 --> 06:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
their communications
 
06:13:40.070 --> 06:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
none of that is available through the
 
06:13:42.948 --> 06:13:42.958 align:start position:0%
76b process right now the only way to
 
06:13:45.030 --> 06:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
get that is through a subpoena if you
 
06:13:47.670 --> 06:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
make this particular change uh
 
06:13:49.270 --> 06:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
that still will be true you will still
 
06:13:51.190 --> 06:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
have to get i'm sorry search warrant you
 
06:13:52.470 --> 06:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
will still have to get a search warrant
 
06:13:54.628 --> 06:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
to get that content
 
06:14:01.510 --> 06:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:03.430 --> 06:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
06:14:05.270 --> 06:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
and just one final question about
 
06:14:07.270 --> 06:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
administrative versus search warrants
 
06:14:08.788 --> 06:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
06:14:11.430 --> 06:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes as written
 
06:14:13.670 --> 06:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
will you still have the capability that
 
06:14:15.750 --> 06:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
you have in the
 
06:14:17.510 --> 06:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
current law that says upon written
 
06:14:19.030 --> 06:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
demand of the attorney et cetera et
 
06:14:20.708 --> 06:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
cetera et cetera
 
06:14:22.548 --> 06:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
both of those things be
 
06:14:24.548 --> 06:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
available to you or would this require
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
that they all be done by search warrants
 
06:14:30.868 --> 06:14:30.878 align:start position:0%
um as i am reading through this proposal
 
06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
effectively what it would mean is that
 
06:14:35.670 --> 06:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
this same information that is currently
 
06:14:37.990 --> 06:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
again 16 to 18 times a year that are
 
06:14:40.470 --> 06:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
used through an administrative subpoena
 
06:14:42.708 --> 06:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
would now be required to have a search
 
06:14:44.548 --> 06:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
warrant done instead and so law
 
06:14:45.990 --> 06:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement would have to seek a search
 
06:14:48.070 --> 06:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
warrant for that same information
 
06:14:52.230 --> 06:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:54.390 --> 06:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative splain
 
06:14:55.750 --> 06:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:14:55.760 --> 06:14:56.548 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

06:14:56.548 --> 06:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:14:58.230 --> 06:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
06:15:00.868 --> 06:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
if i'm understanding this appropriately
 
06:15:02.548 --> 06:15:02.558 align:start position:0%
the extent of information you can get
 
06:15:04.628 --> 06:15:04.638 align:start position:0%
off an administrative request right now
 
06:15:06.470 --> 06:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
is extremely limited
 
06:15:08.868 --> 06:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
you can essentially tell that somebody
 
06:15:10.310 --> 06:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
used a service
 
06:15:12.788 --> 06:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
and what ip they used it from
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct you can't tell any of the
 
06:15:17.350 --> 06:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
other information that they've done over
 
06:15:18.948 --> 06:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
that service when they've logged in or
 
06:15:18.958 --> 06:15:19.670 align:start position:0%
that service when they've logged in or
out

06:15:19.670 --> 06:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
any of the other information
 
06:15:23.670 --> 06:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
if you've determined
 
06:15:26.708 --> 06:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
that they've used the service
 
06:15:28.788 --> 06:15:28.798 align:start position:0%
you would need to now get a search
 
06:15:30.470 --> 06:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
warrant to find the specific information
 
06:15:31.750 --> 06:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
that you think was
 
06:15:34.708 --> 06:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
negligent or criminal in their use of
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
the service is that correct that's
 
06:15:38.470 --> 06:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
06:15:42.868 --> 06:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
so in essence oh follow-up
 
06:15:44.070 --> 06:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:15:47.670 --> 06:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for slacking on that again um
 
06:15:50.628 --> 06:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
all this bill would be doing is taking
 
06:15:54.628 --> 06:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
out the preliminary step where you you
 
06:15:56.470 --> 06:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
verify that the person used the service
 
06:15:58.150 --> 06:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
and had an ip address that came from
 
06:16:00.230 --> 06:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
their computer
 
06:16:01.510 --> 06:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes because you would have to go
 
06:16:04.230 --> 06:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
directly to the warrant process
 
06:16:05.510 --> 06:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
you would have to go directly to the
 
06:16:07.910 --> 06:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
warrant process what it would do it was
 
06:16:09.990 --> 06:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
it would change the method in which that
 
06:16:12.708 --> 06:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
information was gathered instead of
 
06:16:14.548 --> 06:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
the phone call and establishment and the
 
06:16:16.548 --> 06:16:16.558 align:start position:0%
issuance of an administrative 76b
 
06:16:18.470 --> 06:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
subpoena you would go through a warrant
 
06:16:20.310 --> 06:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
process instead
 
06:16:22.230 --> 06:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
and you would have to do that in order
 
06:16:23.990 --> 06:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
to obtain that same information that's
 
06:16:27.510 --> 06:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:29.190 --> 06:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:16:33.910 --> 06:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:38.470 --> 06:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on hb 1282 is now
 
06:16:38.480 --> 06:16:39.510 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on hb 1282 is now
closed

06:16:39.510 --> 06:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
closed
 
06:16:41.110 --> 06:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
06:16:43.270 --> 06:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
be exacting some bills
 
06:16:43.280 --> 06:16:43.570 align:start position:0%
be exacting some bills
so

06:16:43.570 --> 06:16:43.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:43.580 --> 06:16:44.868 align:start position:0%
so

fish a gay committee i agree it's a bad
bill

06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:10.788 --> 06:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative martin you wish to add
 
06:27:14.230 --> 06:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:14.240 --> 06:27:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:27:15.670 --> 06:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:27:17.590 --> 06:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
i have a question if i may
 
06:27:17.600 --> 06:27:18.628 align:start position:0%
i have a question if i may
you

06:27:18.628 --> 06:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:27:20.628 --> 06:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
may you may speak
 
06:27:23.990 --> 06:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
we you heard all the testimony and i
 
06:27:27.110 --> 06:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
was unfortunate not to be here can i get
 
06:27:29.190 --> 06:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
i had originally thought this bill
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
should be enough to pass
 
06:27:34.310 --> 06:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
in my note-taking at home i'm just
 
06:27:36.230 --> 06:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
wondering why are you people thinking
 
06:27:38.150 --> 06:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is a bad bill
 
06:27:40.150 --> 06:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
i mean it gives revenue to the fish and
 
06:27:43.830 --> 06:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
game and it also increases the fines for
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
people littering and to me
 
06:27:47.910 --> 06:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of makes some sense so where
 
06:27:50.310 --> 06:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
is the problem in this bill for me to
 
06:27:51.910 --> 06:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
vote with you i'll start with answering
 
06:27:53.670 --> 06:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
that by i was also not here for the
 
06:27:56.788 --> 06:27:56.798 align:start position:0%
hearing so i didn't hear
 
06:27:58.230 --> 06:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear the testimony that was
 
06:27:59.990 --> 06:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee but from what
 
06:28:01.750 --> 06:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
i understand that this would this would
 
06:28:05.030 --> 06:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a set a cost of 75 000
 
06:28:07.030 --> 06:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that the
 
06:28:08.548 --> 06:28:08.558 align:start position:0%
fines would actually
 
06:28:10.868 --> 06:28:10.878 align:start position:0%
uh account for that revenue but it also
 
06:28:11.990 --> 06:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
has been brought to my attention that
 
06:28:13.510 --> 06:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
there is another
 
06:28:15.030 --> 06:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill that's in the transportation
 
06:28:17.510 --> 06:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
committee that addresses littering
 
06:28:19.670 --> 06:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
that may find its way to this committee
 
06:28:20.948 --> 06:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
is it's a little
 
06:28:23.030 --> 06:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
less of a fiscal impact as this version
 
06:28:24.948 --> 06:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
so that's just my own
 
06:28:24.958 --> 06:28:26.310 align:start position:0%
so that's just my own
opinion

06:28:26.310 --> 06:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
06:28:27.670 --> 06:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
but i wasn't here for the hearing so i
 
06:28:29.670 --> 06:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
can't thank you for that explanation may
 
06:28:32.628 --> 06:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
i ask may i do a follow-up to the
 
06:28:35.030 --> 06:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
gentleman from fish and game
 
06:28:38.150 --> 06:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
an explanation as to why it's a bad bill
 
06:28:40.070 --> 06:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely so again while fish and
 
06:28:41.030 --> 06:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
game is
 
06:28:43.350 --> 06:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
a self-funding agency
 
06:28:45.750 --> 06:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
this starts drawing from other areas of
 
06:28:50.150 --> 06:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
our of our um citizens that hasn't been
 
06:28:51.430 --> 06:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
vetted yet so for lack of a better
 
06:28:53.750 --> 06:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
phrase was we're starting to add
 
06:28:55.990 --> 06:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
we'll use the example of a 500 fine
 
06:28:58.548 --> 06:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
which has a 20 20 penalty assessment
 
06:28:59.910 --> 06:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
which which makes it the six hundred
 
06:29:01.430 --> 06:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
dollar fine which then another twenty
 
06:29:02.948 --> 06:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
percent penalty assessment proficient
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
game which now makes it a six hundred
 
06:29:05.120 --> 06:29:06.070 align:start position:0%
game which now makes it a six hundred
and

06:29:06.070 --> 06:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:29:07.750 --> 06:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
seven hundred and twenty dollar fine so
 
06:29:09.590 --> 06:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's poorly thought out the
 
06:29:11.510 --> 06:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
whole idea of twenty percent is a number
 
06:29:14.468 --> 06:29:14.478 align:start position:0%
that no one's quite sure what it means
 
06:29:15.670 --> 06:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you tim
 
06:29:15.680 --> 06:29:16.948 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman also attorney head
 
06:29:22.548 --> 06:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
from the department of justice said this
 
06:29:25.670 --> 06:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
is going to net about 5 000 a year in
 
06:29:26.948 --> 06:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
new revenue
 
06:29:29.590 --> 06:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
and with a 75 000 implementation cost
 
06:29:32.070 --> 06:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's a net negative of 69 000 bucks
 
06:29:35.670 --> 06:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:37.910 --> 06:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
in 15 years it would take to

i do um i think earlier representative
 
06:32:08.468 --> 06:32:08.478 align:start position:0%
rhodes said it
 
06:32:10.310 --> 06:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
better than i think
 
06:32:12.868 --> 06:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
any of us could um she addressed the
 
06:32:14.310 --> 06:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
seriousness of
 
06:32:17.110 --> 06:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
being able to videotape inside a public
 
06:32:17.120 --> 06:32:18.150 align:start position:0%
being able to videotape inside a public
school

06:32:18.150 --> 06:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:32:19.910 --> 06:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
where parents at this time do have a
 
06:32:21.670 --> 06:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
choice of whether to opt out their
 
06:32:24.230 --> 06:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
children from photographs or videos
 
06:32:25.670 --> 06:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
and this just
 
06:32:28.230 --> 06:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
will put those children and many other
 
06:32:33.590 --> 06:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:35.830 --> 06:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
06:32:38.150 --> 06:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:32:39.910 --> 06:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill is written has
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
several gross unintended consequences
 
06:32:42.320 --> 06:32:43.750 align:start position:0%
several gross unintended consequences
and

06:32:43.750 --> 06:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
while i do recognize
 
06:32:48.390 --> 06:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
that people have the right
 
06:32:50.708 --> 06:32:50.718 align:start position:0%
to record public employees i also
 
06:32:52.390 --> 06:32:52.400 align:start position:0%
recognize the right that public
 
06:32:54.788 --> 06:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
employees have a right to privacy
 
06:32:57.430 --> 06:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
so there was testimony given today that
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
if you are in a room that is labeled
 
06:33:00.638 --> 06:33:02.468 align:start position:0%
if you are in a room that is labeled
private

06:33:02.468 --> 06:33:02.478 align:start position:0%
private
 
06:33:04.948 --> 06:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
but yet you are let's say a boss of an
 
06:33:07.750 --> 06:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
organization that's a public entity
 
06:33:09.910 --> 06:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
if if another employee is in that room
 
06:33:11.830 --> 06:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
having a conversation what if this
 
06:33:11.840 --> 06:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
having a conversation what if this
conversation

06:33:13.750 --> 06:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
06:33:15.430 --> 06:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
involves the employees health what if
 
06:33:18.390 --> 06:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
they need to take a a family time leave
 
06:33:20.708 --> 06:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
for a private matter
 
06:33:22.708 --> 06:33:22.718 align:start position:0%
that is an unintended consequence of
 
06:33:23.990 --> 06:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:33:24.000 --> 06:33:25.350 align:start position:0%
this bill
furthermore

06:33:25.350 --> 06:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
06:33:27.990 --> 06:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
we had discussion about recording in
 
06:33:30.390 --> 06:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
schools so what i fear is going to
 
06:33:31.990 --> 06:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
happen next is we're going to have to
 
06:33:33.350 --> 06:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
have a law
 
06:33:36.390 --> 06:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
that says well now they lawfully need
 
06:33:37.830 --> 06:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
access to
 
06:33:39.670 --> 06:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
the school because they're allowed to
 
06:33:42.070 --> 06:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
record these teachers and that is where
 
06:33:44.070 --> 06:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
we're getting into issue with kids
 
06:33:45.910 --> 06:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
i'm able to protect myself i will
 
06:33:47.750 --> 06:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
protect myself but when you start
 
06:33:50.150 --> 06:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
talking about my child or somebody's
 
06:33:54.230 --> 06:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
else's child that is off limits
 
06:33:56.468 --> 06:33:56.478 align:start position:0%

they're part of government
 
06:35:02.548 --> 06:35:02.558 align:start position:0%
uh recording public officials
 
06:35:06.868 --> 06:35:06.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:06.878 --> 06:35:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
there's

06:35:07.910 --> 06:35:07.920 align:start position:0%

the constitution says government must be
 
06:35:14.320 --> 06:35:15.270 align:start position:0%
the constitution says government must be
open

06:35:15.270 --> 06:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
open
 
06:35:17.270 --> 06:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
and accountable to the people
 
06:35:19.830 --> 06:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i can't support the itl
 
06:35:22.788 --> 06:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:25.030 --> 06:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:35:31.110 --> 06:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
i too was not here for the hearing and
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
i originally was saying maybe ought to
 
06:35:35.190 --> 06:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
pass in my notes
 
06:35:37.990 --> 06:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm somewhat with chris true
 
06:35:39.590 --> 06:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
06:35:41.830 --> 06:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
in that we need to know and there
 
06:35:43.590 --> 06:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be any reason why somebody
 
06:35:45.830 --> 06:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be recorded in their official
 
06:35:49.590 --> 06:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
capacity i understand that politicians
 
06:35:51.910 --> 06:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
have a right to privacy but not a right
 
06:35:53.510 --> 06:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
to privacy when they're doing their
 
06:35:55.350 --> 06:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
official business
 
06:35:57.910 --> 06:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't know but do we now have a
 
06:36:00.628 --> 06:36:00.638 align:start position:0%
situation where you can record officials
 
06:36:02.868 --> 06:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
like policemen and stuff
 
06:36:02.878 --> 06:36:03.590 align:start position:0%
like policemen and stuff
so

06:36:03.590 --> 06:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:06.310 --> 06:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
the courts have
 
06:36:09.110 --> 06:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
ruled on this rather consistently that
 
06:36:10.948 --> 06:36:10.958 align:start position:0%
any public official
 
06:36:13.030 --> 06:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
is your for the most part
 
06:36:14.628 --> 06:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
i mean there's time place and manner
 
06:36:17.030 --> 06:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions but you can you can record
 
06:36:19.270 --> 06:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
a police officer who's acting within
 
06:36:21.270 --> 06:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
their official capacity you as long as
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
you don't obstruct what they're doing
 
06:36:24.948 --> 06:36:24.958 align:start position:0%
you're free to you that's the first
 
06:36:26.948 --> 06:36:26.958 align:start position:0%
amendment and even in some circumstances
 
06:36:28.390 --> 06:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
a fourth amendment
 
06:36:31.190 --> 06:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh issue so you're you're allowed to do
 
06:36:33.030 --> 06:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
that already this was trying to make an
 
06:36:35.350 --> 06:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
attempt to codify
 
06:36:37.750 --> 06:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
basically you know different supreme
 
06:36:39.430 --> 06:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
court cases from all different states
 
06:36:41.430 --> 06:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court united states i
 
06:36:44.310 --> 06:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
think the concern that was brought up
 
06:36:45.910 --> 06:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
and someone who was here please correct
 
06:36:47.190 --> 06:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong
 
06:36:49.270 --> 06:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
is that an individual with perhaps a
 
06:36:49.280 --> 06:36:50.310 align:start position:0%
is that an individual with perhaps a
known

06:36:50.310 --> 06:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
known
 
06:36:51.750 --> 06:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
criminal background
 
06:36:54.070 --> 06:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
can go on school property and because a
 
06:36:55.750 --> 06:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
teacher could be considered a public
 
06:36:57.750 --> 06:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
official because their
 
06:36:59.990 --> 06:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
employee of government
 
06:37:02.548 --> 06:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
could be recorded by this individual
 
06:37:04.150 --> 06:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
with the criminal record and that crime
 
06:37:05.430 --> 06:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
can even involve
 
06:37:07.110 --> 06:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
crimes against children
 
06:37:08.708 --> 06:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless
 
06:37:10.628 --> 06:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
they can do under this if they they're
 
06:37:11.590 --> 06:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
going to say well i have a first
 
06:37:13.510 --> 06:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
amendment right to do this i want to
 
06:37:15.190 --> 06:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
record the teacher oh it just happens to
 
06:37:17.270 --> 06:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
be an elementary school classroom i'm
 
06:37:19.110 --> 06:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
just explaining in that scenario that's
 
06:37:20.628 --> 06:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
the concern of some of the unintended
 
06:37:23.350 --> 06:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
consequences if you're in a public space
 
06:37:24.788 --> 06:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
if someone's in here a member of the
 
06:37:28.230 --> 06:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:30.548 --> 06:37:30.558 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to even and i hope this
 
06:37:31.830 --> 06:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't start happening but if i'm at a
 
06:37:33.030 --> 06:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant even
 
06:37:35.190 --> 06:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
what am i going to do my protection is
 
06:37:36.548 --> 06:37:36.558 align:start position:0%
not the first amendment it's the
 
06:37:39.110 --> 06:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
restaurant to help me out and say hey
 
06:37:40.868 --> 06:37:40.878 align:start position:0%
can you have them stop but as a public
 
06:37:43.510 --> 06:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
figure with some we sign off we sign off
 
06:37:44.868 --> 06:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
on that but a teacher
 
06:37:47.030 --> 06:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
teaching a classroom who's trying to
 
06:37:49.190 --> 06:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
educate children having a
 
06:37:50.830 --> 06:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
that scenario
 
06:37:54.150 --> 06:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
arise it's a concern and i think
 
06:37:55.510 --> 06:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think the bill is well intended i
 
06:37:56.708 --> 06:37:56.718 align:start position:0%
don't think i certainly don't think that
 
06:37:59.030 --> 06:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
was the intended of the sponsors who put
 
06:38:01.110 --> 06:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
the bill forward but
 
06:38:03.750 --> 06:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences it may have
 
06:38:05.270 --> 06:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
06:38:08.390 --> 06:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman
 
06:38:11.590 --> 06:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
the example as i understand it is a
 
06:38:16.310 --> 06:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:19.670 --> 06:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
most schools are secure you have to be
 
06:38:21.670 --> 06:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
buzzed in you have to have a reason for
 
06:38:24.310 --> 06:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
being there you have you got to cease
 
06:38:27.350 --> 06:38:27.360 align:start position:0%
you get stopped you just don't walk in
 
06:38:30.628 --> 06:38:30.638 align:start position:0%
like you did 20 30 years ago so and
 
06:38:33.190 --> 06:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
again a criminal gonna do this i don't
 
06:38:34.948 --> 06:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
think they got the brains to figure out
 
06:38:38.310 --> 06:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
to do that but again i'm along with
 
06:38:40.788 --> 06:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
chris true representative true and i
 
06:38:43.110 --> 06:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
think this bill should ought to pass and
 
06:38:49.110 --> 06:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:51.190 --> 06:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative burke
 
06:38:53.990 --> 06:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i too will be
 
06:38:56.310 --> 06:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill uh i have supported
 
06:38:58.948 --> 06:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
this for many years i've talked to the
 
06:39:01.670 --> 06:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
aclu about putting in a bill
 
06:39:05.430 --> 06:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
to do away even with one consent party
 
06:39:08.310 --> 06:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
because the states that don't have it
 
06:39:09.990 --> 06:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
which are the majority of the states
 
06:39:11.590 --> 06:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's only a few states that are like
 
06:39:15.030 --> 06:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
us where you have to have to consent
 
06:39:17.990 --> 06:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it's easier to
 
06:39:18.000 --> 06:39:20.868 align:start position:0%
and it's easier to
catch

06:39:20.868 --> 06:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:23.110 --> 06:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know the uh
 
06:39:25.350 --> 06:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
town worker the state worker that's
 
06:39:25.360 --> 06:39:26.788 align:start position:0%
town worker the state worker that's
misbehaving

06:39:26.788 --> 06:39:26.798 align:start position:0%
misbehaving
 
06:39:29.510 --> 06:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
or an elected official
 
06:39:32.708 --> 06:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know with the video and audio
 
06:39:34.150 --> 06:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
of a recording
 
06:39:37.270 --> 06:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
of their misdoings
 
06:39:39.990 --> 06:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:41.510 --> 06:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know i just look at you know the
 
06:39:46.548 --> 06:39:46.558 align:start position:0%
government must be recorded at all times
 
06:39:48.310 --> 06:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know if i had my way about it every
 
06:39:50.390 --> 06:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
one of them would wear a body cam and
 
06:39:53.430 --> 06:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
then we'd have access to that body cam
 
06:39:56.070 --> 06:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
now when they're off duty
 
06:39:58.948 --> 06:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely they have a right to privacy
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
but if they're at a grocery store
 
06:40:03.110 --> 06:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know that's a public place anybody
 
06:40:04.468 --> 06:40:04.478 align:start position:0%
can come up and film me people have
 
06:40:06.628 --> 06:40:06.638 align:start position:0%
taken pictures of me at stores
 
06:40:06.638 --> 06:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
taken pictures of me at stores
um

06:40:07.990 --> 06:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:10.548 --> 06:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
you know not often but a few
 
06:40:12.788 --> 06:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
and you know i just was hoping it was
 
06:40:14.948 --> 06:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
because of my looks but you know bottom
 
06:40:14.958 --> 06:40:16.310 align:start position:0%
because of my looks but you know bottom
line

06:40:16.310 --> 06:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
line
 
06:40:18.628 --> 06:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
you know people can do
 
06:40:19.910 --> 06:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
in public
 
06:40:22.070 --> 06:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
they still can do this
 
06:40:24.868 --> 06:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to schools i mean i i
 
06:40:26.628 --> 06:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
think you you know that you know people
 
06:40:28.788 --> 06:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
are just looking way too much into that
 
06:40:31.190 --> 06:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
um i don't see how that can happen out
 
06:40:33.510 --> 06:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
06:40:36.310 --> 06:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh because bottom line a classroom is a
 
06:40:37.910 --> 06:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
private classroom
 
06:40:40.390 --> 06:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
with those students in the teacher and i
 
06:40:42.948 --> 06:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
don't see how this bill would allow
 
06:40:45.030 --> 06:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
somebody to say i have a right to go in
 
06:40:45.040 --> 06:40:46.788 align:start position:0%
somebody to say i have a right to go in
there

06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:40:48.948 --> 06:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
now if it's a parent talking to the
 
06:40:51.830 --> 06:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
teacher you know after school absolutely
 
06:40:53.990 --> 06:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
that parent has the right to videotape
 
06:40:54.000 --> 06:40:55.110 align:start position:0%
that parent has the right to videotape
that

06:40:55.110 --> 06:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:40:56.468 --> 06:40:56.478 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:40:58.390 --> 06:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's just
 
06:41:00.230 --> 06:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know we you know eventually we'll
 
06:41:02.230 --> 06:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
get there but we have to pass something
 
06:41:04.070 --> 06:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
and sadly it doesn't look like this is
 
06:41:05.670 --> 06:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
going to be the bill so hopefully at
 
06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
some point you know they'll redefine
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know what is
 
06:41:09.840 --> 06:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
you know what is
allowed

06:41:11.030 --> 06:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
06:41:12.390 --> 06:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
but you know right now you know
 
06:41:14.548 --> 06:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
throughout the courts you know we can
 
06:41:16.948 --> 06:41:16.958 align:start position:0%
finally videotape police and i know on
 
06:41:19.430 --> 06:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
where they arrested six people for
 
06:41:21.590 --> 06:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
videotaping their own traffic stop with
 
06:41:24.070 --> 06:41:24.080 align:start position:0%
the police and luckily ended up down
 
06:41:26.390 --> 06:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
into a federal court and
 
06:41:28.390 --> 06:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and you know because all
 
06:41:30.310 --> 06:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
of our courts kept saying yeah you can
 
06:41:32.708 --> 06:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
charge them for wiretapping and finally
 
06:41:34.708 --> 06:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
the court down there said you can't so
 
06:41:36.788 --> 06:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill was going to do was
 
06:41:39.670 --> 06:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
to codify what the federal court already
 
06:41:41.670 --> 06:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
says we have a right to do
 
06:41:43.670 --> 06:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully we'll keep pushing
 
06:41:45.670 --> 06:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
toward it thank you
 
06:41:48.548 --> 06:41:48.558 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
06:41:51.270 --> 06:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
06:41:54.070 --> 06:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
i am not i'm going to support the itl
 
06:41:56.390 --> 06:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the primary reason is is just the
 
06:41:57.510 --> 06:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
way the
 
06:41:59.270 --> 06:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
the law
 
06:42:02.230 --> 06:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
is or the proposed law is written
 
06:42:05.030 --> 06:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
and especially because of the
 
06:42:07.830 --> 06:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
the confusion over definitions of things
 
06:42:10.628 --> 06:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
like in a pub in in public what exactly
 
06:42:12.468 --> 06:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
06:42:14.708 --> 06:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:42:14.718 --> 06:42:15.830 align:start position:0%
and um
so

06:42:15.830 --> 06:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:42:18.390 --> 06:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
06:42:20.310 --> 06:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
with the public
 
06:42:22.948 --> 06:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
you can have a public building
 
06:42:25.510 --> 06:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
but there are private spaces in that
 
06:42:28.310 --> 06:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
public building i i after the
 
06:42:30.548 --> 06:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
hearing i talked to one of the people
 
06:42:33.030 --> 06:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
who testified and
 
06:42:35.110 --> 06:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
what i heard and i agreed with was that
 
06:42:37.510 --> 06:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
a public space is probably where the
 
06:42:39.030 --> 06:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
people can come in and out of here and
 
06:42:41.830 --> 06:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
go as they please in a school they can't
 
06:42:45.030 --> 06:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
go in and out of there as they please
 
06:42:47.110 --> 06:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
but that's not defined this way so that
 
06:42:48.948 --> 06:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
people can easily understand what this
 
06:42:50.628 --> 06:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
will be
 
06:42:52.468 --> 06:42:52.478 align:start position:0%
so i think an amendment might be able to
 
06:42:54.468 --> 06:42:54.478 align:start position:0%
improve this bill i don't know
 
06:42:55.990 --> 06:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
but for right now the way it's written
 
06:42:59.430 --> 06:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
now i'll support an idea
 
06:43:03.190 --> 06:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:06.390 --> 06:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill is too far region
 
06:43:09.350 --> 06:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
and we have boards that are water boards
 
06:43:09.360 --> 06:43:10.150 align:start position:0%
and we have boards that are water boards
or

06:43:10.150 --> 06:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:43:10.160 --> 06:43:10.948 align:start position:0%
or
uh

06:43:10.948 --> 06:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:43:13.990 --> 06:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
recreational boards that are considered
 
06:43:16.868 --> 06:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
as officials in that area
 
06:43:18.708 --> 06:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
and that they would be
 
06:43:20.548 --> 06:43:20.558 align:start position:0%
able to be
 
06:43:22.868 --> 06:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
recorded when they might not even know
 
06:43:25.270 --> 06:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
that this law exists
 
06:43:27.510 --> 06:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i just don't think that this
 
06:43:30.230 --> 06:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
world has gone so far that every time
 
06:43:33.030 --> 06:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
somebody speaks they have to be recorded
 
06:43:36.150 --> 06:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:36.160 --> 06:43:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:43:38.070 --> 06:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:43:40.310 --> 06:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
i i do want to say that i'm i'm
 
06:43:42.070 --> 06:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm very sympathetic with the people who
 
06:43:43.910 --> 06:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
put the full the bill forward because i
 
06:43:45.430 --> 06:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
do think that as public officials we
 
06:43:48.230 --> 06:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
have an obligation uh to be transparent
 
06:43:49.830 --> 06:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
and to be cooperative
 
06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
when constituents or anybody else asks
 
06:43:54.708 --> 06:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
us questions about what we're doing
 
06:43:56.390 --> 06:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:43:59.030 --> 06:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
the issues i the issue i have is how we
 
06:44:01.510 --> 06:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
define public officials
 
06:44:03.830 --> 06:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
so are we defining public officials or
 
06:44:05.670 --> 06:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
as people who are
 
06:44:08.628 --> 06:44:08.638 align:start position:0%
elected to office or appointed to office
 
06:44:10.868 --> 06:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
do they include every classified
 
06:44:10.878 --> 06:44:12.230 align:start position:0%
do they include every classified
employee

06:44:12.230 --> 06:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
employee
 
06:44:14.548 --> 06:44:14.558 align:start position:0%
who works for any government agent you
 
06:44:16.310 --> 06:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
know it works for government really at
 
06:44:18.070 --> 06:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
any level at all
 
06:44:18.080 --> 06:44:18.868 align:start position:0%
any level at all
and

06:44:18.868 --> 06:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:44:20.390 --> 06:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
and separating
 
06:44:22.230 --> 06:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:44:24.070 --> 06:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
in an age when a lot of people are
 
06:44:26.230 --> 06:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
working virtually and a lot of people
 
06:44:28.468 --> 06:44:28.478 align:start position:0%
are working at home and not everybody
 
06:44:31.190 --> 06:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
goes to an office um it becomes very
 
06:44:33.590 --> 06:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
very difficult to sort of separate
 
06:44:33.600 --> 06:44:34.548 align:start position:0%
very difficult to sort of separate
um

06:44:34.548 --> 06:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:35.750 --> 06:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:44:37.350 --> 06:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
what your work life is from your
 
06:44:40.390 --> 06:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
personal life and and i think that
 
06:44:44.070 --> 06:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
if we pass if we pass this as written
 
06:44:46.390 --> 06:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we're doing is
 
06:44:50.548 --> 06:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
in an effort to create more transparency
 
06:44:52.948 --> 06:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
we're really opening the doors to some
 
06:44:55.750 --> 06:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
really really critical violations of of
 
06:44:55.760 --> 06:44:57.030 align:start position:0%
really really critical violations of of
privacy

06:44:57.030 --> 06:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
06:45:00.310 --> 06:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
um and also just people's well-being um
 
06:45:02.070 --> 06:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
who needs to be followed around with a
 
06:45:03.750 --> 06:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
camera who needs to worry about having
 
06:45:06.150 --> 06:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
to shut the blinds of their house i mean
 
06:45:08.548 --> 06:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
that one guy was test testified the the
 
06:45:10.310 --> 06:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
only time we shouldn't be available to
 
06:45:12.628 --> 06:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
people is like when we're in our homes
 
06:45:14.788 --> 06:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
uh and when we have the blinds closed i
 
06:45:14.798 --> 06:45:15.590 align:start position:0%
uh and when we have the blinds closed i
mean

06:45:15.590 --> 06:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
mean
 
06:45:16.948 --> 06:45:16.958 align:start position:0%
you know so i mean that gives you an
 
06:45:18.708 --> 06:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
idea how some people might interpret
 
06:45:20.390 --> 06:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
something like this and i think that's
 
06:45:25.750 --> 06:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:27.270 --> 06:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
06:45:28.310 --> 06:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:45:30.150 --> 06:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier i i was one of the
 
06:45:32.628 --> 06:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
sponsors and i believe that there there
 
06:45:36.868 --> 06:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
is absolutely um room where where some
 
06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
recording of public officials can happen
 
06:45:41.270 --> 06:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
and should happen and people should be
 
06:45:43.350 --> 06:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
able to do but i also want us to look at
 
06:45:44.948 --> 06:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
the humanity of it
 
06:45:44.958 --> 06:45:45.830 align:start position:0%
the humanity of it
um

06:45:45.830 --> 06:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:47.830 --> 06:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
right now i go to the landfill every
 
06:45:47.840 --> 06:45:49.030 align:start position:0%
right now i go to the landfill every
saturday

06:45:49.030 --> 06:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
saturday
 
06:45:51.190 --> 06:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh one of the guys at the landfill i i
 
06:45:51.200 --> 06:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
uh one of the guys at the landfill i i
love

06:45:51.910 --> 06:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
love
 
06:45:53.350 --> 06:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
chatting with him i almost said shooting
 
06:45:55.910 --> 06:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
something um chatting with him and he'll
 
06:45:57.910 --> 06:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
give me some of the local gossip and
 
06:45:59.270 --> 06:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's just one of the places you go and
 
06:46:01.190 --> 06:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
you hang out and you talk and he's good
 
06:46:02.788 --> 06:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
well i don't want people like that to
 
06:46:04.150 --> 06:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
worry that every time they talk to
 
06:46:04.160 --> 06:46:05.190 align:start position:0%
worry that every time they talk to
someone

06:46:05.190 --> 06:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
someone
 
06:46:06.628 --> 06:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
they have to we're all going to turn
 
06:46:08.310 --> 06:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
into robots we're going to give the
 
06:46:09.590 --> 06:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
minimal answers we're not going to
 
06:46:11.030 --> 06:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
engage on a personal level like
 
06:46:12.230 --> 06:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
constituents because you never know
 
06:46:13.670 --> 06:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
who's recording you who's trying to
 
06:46:15.670 --> 06:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
who's trying to trap you i mean it's
 
06:46:17.110 --> 06:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
just it's going to turn us all into a
 
06:46:18.548 --> 06:46:18.558 align:start position:0%
bunch of robots
 
06:46:20.468 --> 06:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
now there's some like i said there's
 
06:46:22.390 --> 06:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
some situations such as with law
 
06:46:24.868 --> 06:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement or if you walk into an
 
06:46:27.430 --> 06:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
official's office and it's already an
 
06:46:30.310 --> 06:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
official interaction but when you can be
 
06:46:30.320 --> 06:46:31.430 align:start position:0%
official interaction but when you can be
recorded

06:46:31.430 --> 06:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
06:46:33.350 --> 06:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
at any time or place and it turns into a
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
game of gotcha and you just can't be
 
06:46:36.788 --> 06:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
friends with your constituents anymore
 
06:46:38.788 --> 06:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
or friendly with people you don't know
 
06:46:40.230 --> 06:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
it's just not a world i want to live in
 
06:46:45.990 --> 06:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:47.910 --> 06:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative bourdain
 
06:46:49.430 --> 06:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:46:52.150 --> 06:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to support the ito abortion
 
06:46:52.160 --> 06:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
i'm going to support the ito abortion
um

06:46:53.510 --> 06:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:56.230 --> 06:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
on first reading of the bill it seems to
 
06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
be a good bill something that we could
 
06:47:01.430 --> 06:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
all support we all believe in
 
06:47:03.910 --> 06:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
the public needs to have access to
 
06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
public meetings
 
06:47:05.600 --> 06:47:06.548 align:start position:0%
public meetings
um

06:47:06.548 --> 06:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:08.788 --> 06:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately the way this
 
06:47:10.548 --> 06:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
bill is written
 
06:47:12.468 --> 06:47:12.478 align:start position:0%
and could be interpreted
 
06:47:15.270 --> 06:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
there are ramifications that
 
06:47:15.280 --> 06:47:16.390 align:start position:0%
there are ramifications that
are

06:47:16.390 --> 06:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:47:18.868 --> 06:47:18.878 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly what it is
 
06:47:21.670 --> 06:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
and so is a little broader than we need
 
06:47:21.680 --> 06:47:22.390 align:start position:0%
and so is a little broader than we need
what

06:47:22.390 --> 06:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:47:25.590 --> 06:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
i would suggest is the sponsors of this
 
06:47:25.600 --> 06:47:26.548 align:start position:0%
i would suggest is the sponsors of this
bill

06:47:26.548 --> 06:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:47:27.910 --> 06:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
take a
 
06:47:32.548 --> 06:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:32.558 --> 06:47:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
what

06:47:33.350 --> 06:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:47:35.030 --> 06:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
what should be recorded
 
06:47:37.990 --> 06:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i think public meetings uh are
 
06:47:40.628 --> 06:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
probably the place to start right now i
 
06:47:43.910 --> 06:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:46.948 --> 06:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
legislation that that allows all public
 
06:47:49.350 --> 06:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
meetings to be recorded though in this
 
06:47:51.430 --> 06:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
day and age it seems like all our public
 
06:47:55.830 --> 06:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
meetings are being broadcast
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
and we also maybe want to look at
 
06:48:01.110 --> 06:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
making certain that
 
06:48:03.030 --> 06:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
our citizens and our law enforcement
 
06:48:03.040 --> 06:48:03.910 align:start position:0%
our citizens and our law enforcement
people

06:48:03.910 --> 06:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:48:08.070 --> 06:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
understand that any interactions of
 
06:48:10.788 --> 06:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
them with the public as far as traffic
 
06:48:10.798 --> 06:48:12.468 align:start position:0%
them with the public as far as traffic
stops

06:48:12.468 --> 06:48:12.478 align:start position:0%
stops
 
06:48:12.478 --> 06:48:13.750 align:start position:0%
stops
are

06:48:13.750 --> 06:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:48:13.760 --> 06:48:15.430 align:start position:0%
are
recordable

06:48:15.430 --> 06:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
recordable
 
06:48:15.440 --> 06:48:17.110 align:start position:0%
recordable
and

06:48:17.110 --> 06:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:48:18.390 --> 06:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
i would be
 
06:48:19.990 --> 06:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
more than willing to support such
 
06:48:21.750 --> 06:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislation in the future
 
06:48:23.990 --> 06:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
but i am really opposed to this
 
06:48:29.910 --> 06:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:32.070 --> 06:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
representative eric arthroid
 
06:48:34.390 --> 06:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
while we were in that meeting um
 
06:48:36.390 --> 06:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
yeah while we're in the meeting
 
06:48:39.190 --> 06:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
um bradley did um research because we
 
06:48:40.868 --> 06:48:40.878 align:start position:0%
were concerned about what was public
 
06:48:40.878 --> 06:48:41.670 align:start position:0%
were concerned about what was public
place

06:48:41.670 --> 06:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:48:43.830 --> 06:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
and in in the statute says any place to
 
06:48:45.670 --> 06:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
which the public or substantial group
 
06:48:48.390 --> 06:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
has access the term includes but is not
 
06:48:51.430 --> 06:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
limited to public ways sidewalks schools
 
06:48:53.750 --> 06:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals government offices or
 
06:48:56.948 --> 06:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
facilities and the lobbies or hallways
 
06:48:58.788 --> 06:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
of apartment buildings dormitories
 
06:49:00.948 --> 06:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
hotels or motels
 
06:49:02.390 --> 06:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
he also said please note that this
 
06:49:06.070 --> 06:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
definition was found in rsa 644 colon 2
 
06:49:08.788 --> 06:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
which addresses disorderly conduct
 
06:49:10.628 --> 06:49:10.638 align:start position:0%
i think i was appalled when i think it
 
06:49:12.708 --> 06:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
was one of
 
06:49:15.030 --> 06:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know what town he's from but
 
06:49:17.430 --> 06:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
one of the representatives said that
 
06:49:18.390 --> 06:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
if i was
 
06:49:21.430 --> 06:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
in a restaurant with my son or my child
 
06:49:23.430 --> 06:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
and i was talking politics to them and
 
06:49:25.750 --> 06:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
someone is recording me i don't think i
 
06:49:27.670 --> 06:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
would have felt comfortable about that
 
06:49:29.510 --> 06:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it really did hit home because quite
 
06:49:31.110 --> 06:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
often i'm with my grandchildren and
 
06:49:33.510 --> 06:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
they're for always asking questions and
 
06:49:35.750 --> 06:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm always talking about what happens
 
06:49:37.350 --> 06:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
06:49:40.310 --> 06:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
for me i think that's an overreach
 
06:49:43.270 --> 06:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
into my private life especially
 
06:49:45.350 --> 06:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
and if it didn't matter whether i was
 
06:49:47.110 --> 06:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
off duty at that point because i'm not
 
06:49:47.120 --> 06:49:48.310 align:start position:0%
off duty at that point because i'm not
doing

06:49:48.310 --> 06:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
doing
 
06:49:49.750 --> 06:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
state business
 
06:49:51.670 --> 06:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
right at that point i'm on my own time
 
06:49:54.708 --> 06:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
with my my grandchild or my children
 
06:49:57.430 --> 06:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
so with all that said
 
06:50:00.150 --> 06:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
i tell
 
06:50:01.990 --> 06:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative splain
 
06:50:03.910 --> 06:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
06:50:06.468 --> 06:50:06.478 align:start position:0%
i liked the concept of this bill
 
06:50:09.110 --> 06:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
i liked the ability for
 
06:50:11.350 --> 06:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
a family specifically
 
06:50:12.708 --> 06:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
because of the research i've done into
 
06:50:15.830 --> 06:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
the dcyf situation a family that that
 
06:50:17.910 --> 06:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
had a dcyf person coming in for an
 
06:50:19.350 --> 06:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
interview to be able to record that
 
06:50:21.030 --> 06:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
person in the
 
06:50:23.430 --> 06:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
process of their job inside their own
 
06:50:23.440 --> 06:50:24.310 align:start position:0%
process of their job inside their own
home

06:50:24.310 --> 06:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
home
 
06:50:25.670 --> 06:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
but i had a problem with the fact that
 
06:50:27.110 --> 06:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
it said in public
 
06:50:29.110 --> 06:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
because their home is not public there's
 
06:50:31.830 --> 06:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
a problem with the bill in that aspect
 
06:50:33.510 --> 06:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
i think that yes we should be able to
 
06:50:35.670 --> 06:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
record police officers in the course of
 
06:50:38.150 --> 06:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
their duty when they're in public
 
06:50:39.830 --> 06:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
arresting people or even if they're in
 
06:50:41.750 --> 06:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
private in your private home you have a
 
06:50:44.070 --> 06:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
right to record them in the process of
 
06:50:46.150 --> 06:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
the duties but like others i feel that
 
06:50:47.030 --> 06:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's an
 
06:50:48.788 --> 06:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
uh a great
 
06:50:52.390 --> 06:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
expansion here of what is intended
 
06:50:53.670 --> 06:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
and i would have rather seen this bill
 
06:50:56.628 --> 06:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
go to interim study to fix it
 
06:50:58.310 --> 06:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
but i'll support the itl if that's the
 
06:51:00.310 --> 06:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
way the committee is going because i
 
06:51:02.150 --> 06:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
think that there's a future for this and
 
06:51:04.468 --> 06:51:04.478 align:start position:0%
there's a need for this especially with
 
06:51:06.548 --> 06:51:06.558 align:start position:0%
the situations we've seen
 
06:51:08.948 --> 06:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
with the need to record police and dcyf
 
06:51:11.350 --> 06:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
and other things
 
06:51:14.548 --> 06:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
but at this point this bill is not ready
 
06:51:16.788 --> 06:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
06:51:19.350 --> 06:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair either this probably
 
06:51:21.510 --> 06:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
just a question of the chair or just a
 
06:51:21.520 --> 06:51:23.190 align:start position:0%
just a question of the chair or just a
clarification

06:51:23.190 --> 06:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
06:51:26.230 --> 06:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
of what i believe i heard you say
 
06:51:29.110 --> 06:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
in your given your opinion earlier
 
06:51:29.120 --> 06:51:30.788 align:start position:0%
in your given your opinion earlier
that

06:51:30.788 --> 06:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:51:34.390 --> 06:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has already stated
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
public officials
 
06:51:39.350 --> 06:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
during the performance of their duties
 
06:51:41.590 --> 06:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
may be recorded
 
06:51:42.788 --> 06:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
and that
 
06:51:44.708 --> 06:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
the supreme court did not have any
 
06:51:47.110 --> 06:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty understanding what public
 
06:51:48.548 --> 06:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
officials meant
 
06:51:50.230 --> 06:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
nor do they have any difficulty in
 
06:51:52.708 --> 06:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
deciding what performance of their
 
06:51:55.110 --> 06:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
duties meant
 
06:51:56.708 --> 06:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
06:51:58.548 --> 06:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
all this bill does
 
06:52:00.948 --> 06:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
is put into new hampshire law
 
06:52:03.590 --> 06:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
what the supreme court has ruled in
 
06:52:03.600 --> 06:52:07.190 align:start position:0%
what the supreme court has ruled in
cases

06:52:07.190 --> 06:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:08.868 --> 06:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
i think that's an oversimplification of
 
06:52:11.030 --> 06:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
what i was trying to say but they you
 
06:52:14.070 --> 06:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
are no one right now under current law
 
06:52:16.468 --> 06:52:16.478 align:start position:0%
you know the representatives um
 
06:52:17.990 --> 06:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
using the example if you're in the
 
06:52:20.070 --> 06:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
privacy of your own home can you record
 
06:52:21.510 --> 06:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
someone if you have a home security
 
06:52:23.430 --> 06:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
system as long as you post a notice
 
06:52:25.590 --> 06:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's how you get consent it's a with
 
06:52:27.830 --> 06:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
this if you look at it um
 
06:52:31.270 --> 06:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
rsa 570 a colon 2 that a lot of that has
 
06:52:33.590 --> 06:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
to do with the two-party consent
 
06:52:35.110 --> 06:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
and whether the other party is okay with
 
06:52:36.868 --> 06:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
being recorded and then there's
 
06:52:38.468 --> 06:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
exceptions to when you don't need that
 
06:52:39.990 --> 06:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
person's consent
 
06:52:42.548 --> 06:52:42.558 align:start position:0%
being a public official in a public
 
06:52:44.548 --> 06:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
place there are you do have a right to
 
06:52:46.390 --> 06:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
record the person but
 
06:52:47.990 --> 06:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's it when you have a first amendment
 
06:52:49.350 --> 06:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
right you can't just
 
06:52:50.948 --> 06:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
say whatever you want there's certain
 
06:52:52.948 --> 06:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
things are definition of speech
 
06:52:54.788 --> 06:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
from what i understand that this is
 
06:52:57.030 --> 06:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
being interpreted too broadly where
 
06:52:58.948 --> 06:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
there is no exception you would be
 
06:53:01.030 --> 06:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to record a public official
 
06:53:03.430 --> 06:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
provide their own public any any type of
 
06:53:05.270 --> 06:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
public place without any exception
 
06:53:07.350 --> 06:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
whatsoever so this is taking what i
 
06:53:09.030 --> 06:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
would say the supreme court ruled and
 
06:53:10.868 --> 06:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
even expanding that
 
06:53:12.948 --> 06:53:12.958 align:start position:0%
and and i think what it's expanding it
 
06:53:12.958 --> 06:53:13.830 align:start position:0%
and and i think what it's expanding it
to

06:53:13.830 --> 06:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:53:15.190 --> 06:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
is what are the some of the unintended
 
06:53:16.788 --> 06:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
consequences that a lot of members had
 
06:53:19.190 --> 06:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
concerns with i don't if someone is here
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
filming us
 
06:53:22.948 --> 06:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
it's their right and under the first
 
06:53:24.788 --> 06:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
amendment they're allowed to do it and
 
06:53:27.190 --> 06:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
no one no one would argue otherwise but
 
06:53:29.110 --> 06:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
by codifying this and keep in mind the
 
06:53:30.788 --> 06:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
supreme court united states makes it
 
06:53:32.150 --> 06:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
makes a decision
 
06:53:33.350 --> 06:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
but we
 
06:53:35.030 --> 06:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
and representative harrick gathered read
 
06:53:35.040 --> 06:53:36.230 align:start position:0%
and representative harrick gathered read
this

06:53:36.230 --> 06:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:53:39.030 --> 06:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
as at the state level have a definition
 
06:53:41.830 --> 06:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
of public officials in public property
 
06:53:43.670 --> 06:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
so that's where it can be the language
 
06:53:44.788 --> 06:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
we can mix and match your words and
 
06:53:46.788 --> 06:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
create confusion that's why the
 
06:53:48.708 --> 06:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences is what a lot of
 
06:53:50.150 --> 06:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
the concern people have with the bill is
 
06:53:52.230 --> 06:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
this my concern is
 
06:53:54.070 --> 06:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
we may respond to whatever
 
06:53:56.070 --> 06:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
06:53:58.708 --> 06:53:58.718 align:start position:0%
pre-med not pre-law but
 
06:54:01.510 --> 06:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
could you give us the supreme court case
 
06:54:04.070 --> 06:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
where they stated that public officials
 
06:54:05.110 --> 06:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
may be
 
06:54:05.120 --> 06:54:06.310 align:start position:0%
may be
recorded

06:54:06.310 --> 06:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
06:54:08.548 --> 06:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
during the performance of their duties
 
06:54:10.548 --> 06:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
so that we could have a chance to read
 
06:54:12.708 --> 06:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
that supreme court ruling
 
06:54:14.310 --> 06:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head i can't but it
 
06:54:16.150 --> 06:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
involved the
 
06:54:18.628 --> 06:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
similar law in massachusetts whereas a
 
06:54:20.310 --> 06:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
student was filming
 
06:54:22.230 --> 06:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
police officers arrest her her friend
 
06:54:24.390 --> 06:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
and she was also then
 
06:54:25.910 --> 06:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
got in trouble apparently for recording
 
06:54:27.830 --> 06:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
the police officers and the argument was
 
06:54:27.840 --> 06:54:28.548 align:start position:0%
the police officers and the argument was
well

06:54:28.548 --> 06:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:54:30.230 --> 06:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
she didn't have our consent to record us
 
06:54:32.150 --> 06:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court said
 
06:54:33.830 --> 06:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
no you were in public you're a police
 
06:54:35.190 --> 06:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
officer you were performing an arrest
 
06:54:38.548 --> 06:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
she had a first amendment right to
 
06:54:40.548 --> 06:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
record that because what she believed
 
06:54:42.230 --> 06:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
was sincerely a fourth amendment
 
06:54:44.548 --> 06:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
violation an unlawful arrest regardless
 
06:54:45.910 --> 06:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
of what the arrest of was lawful the
 
06:54:47.750 --> 06:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
court said in that scenario they said as
 
06:54:49.750 --> 06:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
applied in that circumstance
 
06:54:51.670 --> 06:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
that was unconstitutional because she
 
06:54:53.270 --> 06:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
had a right to record that's not a new
 
06:54:55.590 --> 06:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire law i thank you for that
 
06:54:57.910 --> 06:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
maybe a rough idea with a year so i'd
 
06:54:59.670 --> 06:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
have a chance of finding it i think it's
 
06:55:04.070 --> 06:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:05.830 --> 06:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm pretty sure it's someone you know
 
06:55:08.230 --> 06:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
chris it's carla geralic's case when she
 
06:55:10.230 --> 06:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
was recording the where police officers
 
06:55:12.948 --> 06:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
i believe it was um so it's someone you
 
06:55:14.310 --> 06:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
even know you can go have a conversation
 
06:55:15.430 --> 06:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
with her she took it all the way to the
 
06:55:17.030 --> 06:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
supreme court because she was charged
 
06:55:20.150 --> 06:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
with wiretapping and then she ended up
 
06:55:21.590 --> 06:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
taking all the way to the supreme court
 
06:55:22.868 --> 06:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court ruled that you
 
06:55:24.150 --> 06:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
have the right to
 
06:55:25.510 --> 06:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
to film a police officer in a
 
06:55:26.868 --> 06:55:26.878 align:start position:0%
performance of his duties and you don't
 
06:55:28.070 --> 06:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
need their consent because they're in
 
06:55:30.708 --> 06:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
the actions of doing their public job
 
06:55:33.270 --> 06:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
if i could just say one more thing
 
06:55:34.948 --> 06:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
thank you so the second thing i'd say
 
06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
chris is what are you off duty
 
06:55:38.628 --> 06:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
when you're off duty as a state
 
06:55:38.638 --> 06:55:41.350 align:start position:0%
when you're off duty as a state
representative

06:55:41.350 --> 06:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:43.830 --> 06:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
when is a police officer off duty
 
06:55:43.840 --> 06:55:45.910 align:start position:0%
when is a police officer off duty
right

06:55:45.910 --> 06:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:55:48.230 --> 06:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'd say a police officer is off duty
 
06:55:50.468 --> 06:55:50.478 align:start position:0%
when he's off shift
 
06:55:53.110 --> 06:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh the police officer goes back on duty
 
06:55:55.030 --> 06:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
if he's going to click claim the right
 
06:55:57.430 --> 06:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
as a police officer to
 
06:55:59.110 --> 06:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
stop a crime
 
06:56:01.350 --> 06:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
now now he's acting as in his official
 
06:56:01.360 --> 06:56:02.548 align:start position:0%
now now he's acting as in his official
capacity

06:56:02.548 --> 06:56:02.558 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
06:56:04.708 --> 06:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
he's not on the clock there but he just
 
06:56:07.830 --> 06:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
went became an official
 
06:56:10.310 --> 06:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative of the police uh so the
 
06:56:11.590 --> 06:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunate thing as a police officer
 
06:56:13.510 --> 06:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
you're on duty 24 hours a day
 
06:56:15.510 --> 06:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
you have the you have the authority and
 
06:56:18.310 --> 06:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to act and so you
 
06:56:18.320 --> 06:56:19.350 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to act and so you
have

06:56:19.350 --> 06:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:56:21.110 --> 06:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
almost in any circumstance of this law
 
06:56:22.868 --> 06:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
to go in effect you have no privacy
 
06:56:24.868 --> 06:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
anywhere you go because a police officer
 
06:56:26.628 --> 06:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
has that authority and they they have an
 
06:56:28.390 --> 06:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
obligation to act
 
06:56:28.400 --> 06:56:29.510 align:start position:0%
obligation to act
um

06:56:29.510 --> 06:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:56:32.468 --> 06:56:32.478 align:start position:0%
so again i i think this this law is a
 
06:56:34.788 --> 06:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
little bit too broad a little bit too
 
06:56:37.190 --> 06:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
vague um you know
 
06:56:38.868 --> 06:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
again i go back to the conversation when
 
06:56:40.548 --> 06:56:40.558 align:start position:0%
are you off duty how many conversations
 
06:56:42.150 --> 06:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
you have about politics when you're at
 
06:56:44.390 --> 06:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
home you're in a restaurant you're in a
 
06:56:46.230 --> 06:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
grocery store someone comes up and says
 
06:56:48.070 --> 06:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
hey what happened to this bill
 
06:56:49.670 --> 06:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
and the question is do you want us a
 
06:56:50.868 --> 06:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
camera in your face every time you're
 
06:56:52.150 --> 06:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
just having a private conversation with
 
06:56:54.628 --> 06:56:54.638 align:start position:0%
a citizen citizen about updating them on
 
06:56:56.390 --> 06:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
whatever the information was
 
06:56:58.548 --> 06:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
do you want a camera in your face i i
 
06:57:01.350 --> 06:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
think that that's you know it's it
 
06:57:03.910 --> 06:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
it causes problems and to not over
 
06:57:05.910 --> 06:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
confuse the issue when we say public
 
06:57:08.070 --> 06:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
officials if you're a public figure a
 
06:57:11.030 --> 06:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
celebrity an actress or a famous author
 
06:57:13.110 --> 06:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
they go out in public and they're
 
06:57:15.270 --> 06:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
constantly confronted by other members
 
06:57:16.548 --> 06:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
of the public want to take a picture
 
06:57:18.390 --> 06:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
with them or the paparazzi follows them
 
06:57:20.150 --> 06:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
around and even that's protected by the
 
06:57:21.910 --> 06:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
first amendment when they're sitting in
 
06:57:24.230 --> 06:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
a restaurant just having a cup of coffee
 
06:57:25.670 --> 06:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden people just start
 
06:57:27.190 --> 06:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
taking their pictures
 
06:57:29.510 --> 06:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
so celebrities go through the same thing
 
06:57:31.430 --> 06:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
as well but we're talking about kids in
 
06:57:33.510 --> 06:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
a classroom here and a teacher teaching
 
06:57:36.310 --> 06:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
a class and all the concern is is that
 
06:57:38.948 --> 06:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
the bill as drafted
 
06:57:41.510 --> 06:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
would go too far no one's no one's
 
06:57:42.948 --> 06:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
trying to trample the first amendment
 
06:57:42.958 --> 06:57:45.270 align:start position:0%
trying to trample the first amendment
here

06:57:45.270 --> 06:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:46.708 --> 06:57:46.718 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that's a fair
 
06:57:49.030 --> 06:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
interpretation because as has been
 
06:57:51.350 --> 06:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned before you can say i want to
 
06:57:53.910 --> 06:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
protect my children but the school
 
06:57:55.670 --> 06:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
protects your children by not allowing
 
06:57:57.510 --> 06:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
you to walk into the school you can't
 
06:58:00.230 --> 06:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
say well those kids were being filmed by
 
06:58:00.240 --> 06:58:01.510 align:start position:0%
say well those kids were being filmed by
this

06:58:01.510 --> 06:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:58:04.070 --> 06:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
whoever he was this mr unknown
 
06:58:05.910 --> 06:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
what the principal just buzzed through
 
06:58:08.310 --> 06:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
go walk around all you want that doesn't
 
06:58:10.270 --> 06:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
happen so it's an unfair
 
06:58:12.548 --> 06:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
characterization that it's about the
 
06:58:12.558 --> 06:58:13.830 align:start position:0%
characterization that it's about the
students

06:58:13.830 --> 06:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:58:18.548 --> 06:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:20.548 --> 06:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
representative marston
 
06:58:22.788 --> 06:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just want to
 
06:58:24.990 --> 06:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
point out to the committee it
 
06:58:27.030 --> 06:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
specifically says
 
06:58:28.708 --> 06:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
when you are in the process of
 
06:58:31.270 --> 06:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
performing his or her duties
 
06:58:33.350 --> 06:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
when you're in a restaurant you're not
 
06:58:35.270 --> 06:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
performing your duties you're feeding
 
06:58:38.548 --> 06:58:38.558 align:start position:0%
your belly and you are not to be then
 
06:58:38.558 --> 06:58:40.070 align:start position:0%
your belly and you are not to be then
recorded

06:58:40.070 --> 06:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
06:58:42.230 --> 06:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
but i i don't understand why you have
 
06:58:43.510 --> 06:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
such a problem
 
06:58:45.830 --> 06:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
there's a time and a place to record
 
06:58:48.468 --> 06:58:48.478 align:start position:0%
officials doing their official duties
 
06:58:50.468 --> 06:58:50.478 align:start position:0%
such as the police arresting somebody
 
06:58:52.788 --> 06:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth there are times
 
06:58:56.548 --> 06:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
and places when we do not should not be
 
06:58:59.990 --> 06:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
allowing somebody to photograph or take
 
06:59:01.910 --> 06:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
videos of you when you're in a
 
06:59:03.990 --> 06:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant or when you read your family
 
06:59:06.390 --> 06:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
out shopping that's that's ludicrous
 
06:59:09.110 --> 06:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
who's doing that i just want to point
 
06:59:09.120 --> 06:59:13.990 align:start position:0%
who's doing that i just want to point
out

06:59:13.990 --> 06:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:15.670 --> 06:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to remind the community i
 
06:59:18.788 --> 06:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for the public hearing so
 
06:59:22.150 --> 06:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
so if if someone wants to summarize what
 
06:59:26.230 --> 06:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
what was perhaps said in a short
 
06:59:26.240 --> 06:59:30.150 align:start position:0%
what was perhaps said in a short
concise

06:59:30.150 --> 06:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:31.430 --> 06:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative right you were you at the
 
06:59:32.868 --> 06:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
time acting as chair of the committee
 
06:59:34.390 --> 06:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps you would like to
 
06:59:36.628 --> 06:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
summarize the concerning
 
06:59:38.708 --> 06:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
the the the sponsor of the bill was was
 
06:59:41.190 --> 06:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
entirely reasonable um the the other the
 
06:59:43.990 --> 06:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
supporter of the bill was not quite so
 
06:59:44.000 --> 06:59:44.788 align:start position:0%
supporter of the bill was not quite so
much

06:59:44.788 --> 06:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
much
 
06:59:44.798 --> 06:59:45.750 align:start position:0%
much
um

06:59:45.750 --> 06:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:48.468 --> 06:59:48.478 align:start position:0%
and he was here recording us as he did
 
06:59:49.990 --> 06:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
it which is right
 
06:59:50.000 --> 06:59:51.190 align:start position:0%
it which is right
um

06:59:51.190 --> 06:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
but when explaining what he would do
 
06:59:54.948 --> 06:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
with the bill
 
06:59:54.958 --> 06:59:56.468 align:start position:0%
with the bill
um

06:59:56.468 --> 06:59:56.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:00.708 --> 07:00:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:00.718 --> 07:00:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:00:09.270 --> 07:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:11.670 --> 07:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
sorry he said that he would remove the
 
07:00:13.830 --> 07:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
section where it says
 
07:00:15.670 --> 07:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
in the process of performing his or her
 
07:00:18.230 --> 07:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
duties it should be done at any time and
 
07:00:18.240 --> 07:00:19.350 align:start position:0%
duties it should be done at any time and
anywhere

07:00:19.350 --> 07:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
07:00:19.360 --> 07:00:21.110 align:start position:0%
anywhere
yeah

07:00:21.110 --> 07:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
07:00:22.868 --> 07:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
i'm telling you what he was recommending
 
07:00:25.590 --> 07:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
an amendment for yeah
 
07:00:27.830 --> 07:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't uh to clarify the school
 
07:00:29.990 --> 07:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
issue there was never any talk about
 
07:00:32.390 --> 07:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
adults being able to walk into schools
 
07:00:35.030 --> 07:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
what the discussion was was a student in
 
07:00:37.670 --> 07:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
the school wanting to videotape their
 
07:00:37.680 --> 07:00:38.868 align:start position:0%
the school wanting to videotape their
teacher

07:00:38.868 --> 07:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
07:00:41.190 --> 07:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
and well in the process of doing that if
 
07:00:42.868 --> 07:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
the kid is five rows back he's gonna
 
07:00:44.628 --> 07:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
catch the first five rules of other
 
07:00:46.628 --> 07:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
students in that recording whose parents
 
07:00:48.548 --> 07:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
have not given permission and his
 
07:00:50.150 --> 07:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
response to that was well if you don't
 
07:00:51.670 --> 07:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
like that take your kid to a private
 
07:00:51.680 --> 07:00:52.548 align:start position:0%
like that take your kid to a private
school

07:00:52.548 --> 07:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
school
 
07:00:52.558 --> 07:00:53.430 align:start position:0%
school
um

07:00:53.430 --> 07:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:55.190 --> 07:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that's just entirely inappropriate
 
07:00:56.788 --> 07:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
what good does it have a policy in a
 
07:00:58.868 --> 07:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
school where you cannot
 
07:01:00.390 --> 07:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
take images of students without the
 
07:01:02.948 --> 07:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
parent's permission to just let
 
07:01:05.110 --> 07:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
anyone take videos and put it out on the
 
07:01:07.350 --> 07:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
internet for anyone to see and someone
 
07:01:09.110 --> 07:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
advocating for that frankly with a with
 
07:01:10.788 --> 07:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
a criminal record of inappropriate
 
07:01:12.628 --> 07:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
conduct with children is just beyond the
 
07:01:12.638 --> 07:01:14.548 align:start position:0%
conduct with children is just beyond the
pale

07:01:14.548 --> 07:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
pale
 
07:01:16.868 --> 07:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
having said that i still think there is
 
07:01:18.708 --> 07:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
reasonable ground to be had in it but
 
07:01:21.750 --> 07:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
this is not the vehicle to do it
 
07:01:24.390 --> 07:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
so just to summarize that testimony that
 
07:01:26.948 --> 07:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
i was not here for
 
07:01:28.948 --> 07:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that
 
07:01:31.270 --> 07:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
if a teacher was with their classroom on
 
07:01:32.868 --> 07:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
a field trip on
 
07:01:34.708 --> 07:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
some nature trail somewhere in a public
 
07:01:34.718 --> 07:01:35.750 align:start position:0%
some nature trail somewhere in a public
place

07:01:35.750 --> 07:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
place
 
07:01:38.070 --> 07:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
that individual although
 
07:01:39.750 --> 07:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
recording the teacher may
 
07:01:41.910 --> 07:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
inadvertently record the students as
 
07:01:43.830 --> 07:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
well would be within their grounds to do
 
07:01:43.840 --> 07:01:47.670 align:start position:0%
well would be within their grounds to do
so

07:01:47.670 --> 07:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:49.910 --> 07:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
yes if the if the teacher has taken the
 
07:01:51.750 --> 07:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
kids to a public park
 
07:01:53.910 --> 07:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
people in that public park can record
 
07:01:56.150 --> 07:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
anyone they want there's no expectation
 
07:02:00.948 --> 07:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:04.070 --> 07:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:05.590 --> 07:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for
 
07:02:08.310 --> 07:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
summarizing the testimony
 
07:02:10.310 --> 07:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative splain
 
07:02:11.910 --> 07:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair one of the other
 
07:02:13.350 --> 07:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
areas that they talked about that sort
 
07:02:15.190 --> 07:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
of had blurred lines was the expectation
 
07:02:17.990 --> 07:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
of privacy and uh
 
07:02:19.990 --> 07:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
it it pained me to hear the testimony of
 
07:02:22.150 --> 07:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
the young child who got
 
07:02:24.788 --> 07:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
some of his school years taken away by
 
07:02:26.390 --> 07:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
recording something at school or
 
07:02:27.750 --> 07:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
recording the police interaction and
 
07:02:29.990 --> 07:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
then getting penalized at school and
 
07:02:31.830 --> 07:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
having his homework locked down and
 
07:02:33.350 --> 07:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
everything because
 
07:02:34.948 --> 07:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
there was a reason there was no
 
07:02:36.628 --> 07:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of privacy for
 
07:02:39.110 --> 07:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
police arresting someone on the street
 
07:02:39.120 --> 07:02:39.990 align:start position:0%
police arresting someone on the street
but

07:02:39.990 --> 07:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:02:41.910 --> 07:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
again i think that we've gone beyond the
 
07:02:44.788 --> 07:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
police situation and i would point out
 
07:02:47.430 --> 07:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh as well that it was the supreme court
 
07:02:50.230 --> 07:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
case in 2014 of frasier versus evans
 
07:02:52.150 --> 07:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
that codified the recording of the
 
07:02:52.160 --> 07:02:53.990 align:start position:0%
that codified the recording of the
police

07:02:53.990 --> 07:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
police
 
07:02:59.910 --> 07:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:05.110 --> 07:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:06.788 --> 07:03:06.798 align:start position:0%

07:06:41.270 --> 07:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
all she did was miss the world before
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
she missed but knowing my friend from
 
07:06:44.948 --> 07:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
nashua would never
 
07:06:46.628 --> 07:06:46.638 align:start position:0%
never disrupt anything like that on
 
07:06:46.638 --> 07:06:48.868 align:start position:0%
never disrupt anything like that on
purpose

07:06:48.868 --> 07:06:48.878 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
07:06:51.430 --> 07:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
but before we get to that uh
 
07:06:53.510 --> 07:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
there was a bill we had last year
 
07:06:56.468 --> 07:06:56.478 align:start position:0%
i believe it was hb 569.
 
07:06:59.350 --> 07:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
i i supported the bill in this room
 
07:07:00.310 --> 07:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
i went
 
07:07:03.270 --> 07:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
to the i spoke on well not
 
07:07:04.628 --> 07:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
we're in the sports arena i spoke at the
 
07:07:06.390 --> 07:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
sports arena in support of the motion of
 
07:07:07.910 --> 07:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
07:07:09.830 --> 07:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
it passed in the house
 
07:07:11.350 --> 07:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
went to the
 
07:07:14.150 --> 07:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
other body that we shall not mention
 
07:07:17.910 --> 07:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
where it was itled or whatever version
 
07:07:19.670 --> 07:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
they have of that
 
07:07:22.150 --> 07:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
it's our understanding and
 
07:07:23.910 --> 07:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
07:07:25.910 --> 07:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
inquired with the clerk
 
07:07:27.510 --> 07:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
not not the cl not the clerk for the
 
07:07:29.350 --> 07:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
house the clerk in the body that we
 
07:07:32.070 --> 07:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
shall not mention
 
07:07:33.670 --> 07:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
that are they allowed to hear this in
 
07:07:35.590 --> 07:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
the first place actually take this issue
 
07:07:35.600 --> 07:07:37.030 align:start position:0%
the first place actually take this issue
up

07:07:37.030 --> 07:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:07:37.040 --> 07:07:38.310 align:start position:0%
up
and

07:07:38.310 --> 07:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:07:39.670 --> 07:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding of that conversation
 
07:07:41.110 --> 07:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
the answer is no
 
07:07:42.708 --> 07:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
similar to where if we
 
07:07:44.628 --> 07:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
in the house were to
 
07:07:46.628 --> 07:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
find something in expedia to legislate
 
07:07:48.948 --> 07:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
if the same bill or a similar one like
 
07:07:51.350 --> 07:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
that were to come back
 
07:07:53.190 --> 07:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
even if we even if we change our mind
 
07:07:54.468 --> 07:07:54.478 align:start position:0%
and like it i'm not sure we're allowed
 
07:07:54.478 --> 07:07:55.270 align:start position:0%
and like it i'm not sure we're allowed
to

07:07:55.270 --> 07:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:07:58.310 --> 07:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
act on it so
 
07:08:00.310 --> 07:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
with that being said
 
07:08:02.708 --> 07:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
as much as i may want to
 
07:08:04.708 --> 07:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
show some support for the bill that was
 
07:08:04.718 --> 07:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
show some support for the bill that was
filed

07:08:06.230 --> 07:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
filed
 
07:08:06.240 --> 07:08:07.830 align:start position:0%
filed
1282

07:08:07.830 --> 07:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
1282
 
07:08:10.230 --> 07:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
if i might ask the chair a question
 
07:08:12.788 --> 07:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
you're so recognized has the senate
 
07:08:12.798 --> 07:08:13.830 align:start position:0%
you're so recognized has the senate
clerk

07:08:13.830 --> 07:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
07:08:15.670 --> 07:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
read the bill to determine if it's
 
07:08:18.070 --> 07:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
substantially different or not
 
07:08:20.150 --> 07:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
since it has not been yet introduced
 
07:08:22.548 --> 07:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
into the senate
 
07:08:24.708 --> 07:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative roy you may be the better
 
07:08:26.948 --> 07:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
person to answer that
 
07:08:29.350 --> 07:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
i gave the uh
 
07:08:29.360 --> 07:08:30.230 align:start position:0%
i gave the uh
the

07:08:30.230 --> 07:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:08:33.270 --> 07:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:35.190 --> 07:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
the uh bill numbers but i did not
 
07:08:36.788 --> 07:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
actually give him the like give her the
 
07:08:38.310 --> 07:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
language but
 
07:08:40.390 --> 07:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
she gave me a copy
 
07:08:41.750 --> 07:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the rule
 
07:08:44.230 --> 07:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
and it clearly said that it's similar to
 
07:08:46.628 --> 07:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
ours if it's it held its itl they can't
 
07:08:50.070 --> 07:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:52.468 --> 07:08:52.478 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair well um
 
07:08:54.070 --> 07:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
i had this conversation with the prime
 
07:08:56.468 --> 07:08:56.478 align:start position:0%
sponsor the representative from fremont
 
07:08:58.788 --> 07:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
and his words to me was that the bill
 
07:09:00.390 --> 07:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
had been substantially changed and
 
07:09:02.708 --> 07:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
addressed some of the confusion that it
 
07:09:04.948 --> 07:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
created in this in the other body
 
07:09:06.708 --> 07:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
and to that end
 
07:09:08.070 --> 07:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to give this bill a
 
07:09:08.080 --> 07:09:09.030 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to give this bill a
chance

07:09:09.030 --> 07:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
chance
 
07:09:11.110 --> 07:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
and ols
 
07:09:12.390 --> 07:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
should have caught that and shouldn't
 
07:09:13.910 --> 07:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
have allowed it to proceed if that was
 
07:09:15.670 --> 07:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
the case that it was
 
07:09:19.270 --> 07:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
that much if it was that similar so
 
07:09:21.590 --> 07:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm of the opinion to
 
07:09:23.590 --> 07:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
pass this out a committee send it over
 
07:09:25.350 --> 07:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
to the other body
 
07:09:26.948 --> 07:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
and let the decision be made at that
 
07:09:26.958 --> 07:09:27.910 align:start position:0%
and let the decision be made at that
point

07:09:27.910 --> 07:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
07:09:30.070 --> 07:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
and let me just clarify
 
07:09:33.030 --> 07:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
to the determination of whether a bill
 
07:09:34.468 --> 07:09:34.478 align:start position:0%
is substantially similar or not is not
 
07:09:35.830 --> 07:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
something as the chair i'm allowed to
 
07:09:37.990 --> 07:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
make that determination
 
07:09:39.670 --> 07:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
so i don't make that determination it's
 
07:09:41.830 --> 07:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
just something to keep in mind
 
07:09:43.830 --> 07:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
but if the clerk
 
07:09:45.910 --> 07:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
made that
 
07:09:48.468 --> 07:09:48.478 align:start position:0%
suggestion and
 
07:09:49.910 --> 07:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
it just it may be an idea where it's
 
07:09:52.070 --> 07:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
going it doesn't again that's nothing to
 
07:09:54.070 --> 07:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
do with the policy of the bill it's just
 
07:09:56.788 --> 07:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
something to keep in mind
 
07:09:59.110 --> 07:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
if i may and it's my understanding that
 
07:10:01.110 --> 07:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
in our body the speaker of the house
 
07:10:02.868 --> 07:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
determines whether or not something is
 
07:10:04.708 --> 07:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
germane or not not the clerk of the
 
07:10:06.708 --> 07:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
court that being said
 
07:10:08.708 --> 07:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the other body doesn't have
 
07:10:09.990 --> 07:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
that role that would be the senate
 
07:10:12.230 --> 07:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
president would it not
 
07:10:14.310 --> 07:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
without being an expert on the rules but
 
07:10:17.270 --> 07:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
if if it's parallel to that of the house
 
07:10:20.230 --> 07:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
correct thank you but may i read the
 
07:10:20.240 --> 07:10:21.830 align:start position:0%
correct thank you but may i read the
rule

07:10:21.830 --> 07:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
rule
 
07:10:24.948 --> 07:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:28.070 --> 07:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
general rules on bills 3-2-1
 
07:10:30.468 --> 07:10:30.478 align:start position:0%
prohibition in second year session no
 
07:10:32.708 --> 07:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
bill or resolution the subject matter of
 
07:10:35.110 --> 07:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
which has been indefinitely postponed or
 
07:10:37.270 --> 07:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
made inexpedient to legislate
 
07:10:40.390 --> 07:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
in the other place in the
 
07:10:42.788 --> 07:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
in the first year session shall be
 
07:10:44.868 --> 07:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
admitted into the second year session
 
07:10:47.030 --> 07:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
whether as a bill an amendment a
 
07:10:49.110 --> 07:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee of conference report or in any
 
07:10:55.590 --> 07:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:59.030 --> 07:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:00.230 --> 07:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative marston you've been
 
07:11:00.240 --> 07:11:02.230 align:start position:0%
representative marston you've been
recognized

07:11:02.230 --> 07:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
07:11:04.468 --> 07:11:04.478 align:start position:0%
the question that i have is
 
07:11:06.150 --> 07:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
that i'm confused about what you're
 
07:11:08.708 --> 07:11:08.718 align:start position:0%
saying this bill
 
07:11:11.030 --> 07:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
was previously
 
07:11:13.190 --> 07:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
passed in our house and went to the
 
07:11:15.990 --> 07:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:18.070 --> 07:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
well which is it yes and no is what i'm
 
07:11:18.080 --> 07:11:19.830 align:start position:0%
well which is it yes and no is what i'm
hearing

07:11:19.830 --> 07:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
07:11:24.948 --> 07:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:24.958 --> 07:11:26.628 align:start position:0%
 
hb5

07:11:26.628 --> 07:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
hb5
 
07:11:30.150 --> 07:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:33.030 --> 07:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
539 so hb 539
 
07:11:35.910 --> 07:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
was the bill we had last year
 
07:11:38.230 --> 07:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
the language is not word for word the
 
07:11:39.990 --> 07:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
same exact
 
07:11:40.000 --> 07:11:41.670 align:start position:0%
same exact
draft

07:11:41.670 --> 07:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
draft
 
07:11:41.680 --> 07:11:42.788 align:start position:0%
draft
so

07:11:42.788 --> 07:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:11:45.510 --> 07:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
can i finish answering the question
 
07:11:47.430 --> 07:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
that i'm in the middle of before i
 
07:11:50.230 --> 07:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
inquire take another one
 
07:11:52.628 --> 07:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
so it's not the same word for word
 
07:11:54.708 --> 07:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't what
 
07:11:56.230 --> 07:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
i think a
 
07:11:58.548 --> 07:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
plain reading of the rule is that if
 
07:12:01.670 --> 07:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's on the same topic subject matter
 
07:12:03.190 --> 07:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
which this
 
07:12:05.910 --> 07:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
involves how the st the
 
07:12:05.920 --> 07:12:06.788 align:start position:0%
involves how the st the
state

07:12:06.788 --> 07:12:06.798 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:12:09.030 --> 07:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
government gets records
 
07:12:11.590 --> 07:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
from common carriers by getting a
 
07:12:11.600 --> 07:12:12.788 align:start position:0%
from common carriers by getting a
warrant

07:12:12.788 --> 07:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
07:12:16.868 --> 07:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
the last fight hp 539 was that same
 
07:12:16.878 --> 07:12:17.910 align:start position:0%
the last fight hp 539 was that same
issue

07:12:17.910 --> 07:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
issue
 
07:12:19.590 --> 07:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
how does the
 
07:12:22.310 --> 07:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
attorney general of the state get
 
07:12:24.708 --> 07:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
records from uh communication common
 
07:12:24.718 --> 07:12:25.830 align:start position:0%
records from uh communication common
carriers

07:12:25.830 --> 07:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
carriers
 
07:12:25.840 --> 07:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
carriers
and

07:12:27.350 --> 07:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:12:29.430 --> 07:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
what that would have done 539 would have
 
07:12:31.270 --> 07:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
increased it to a probable cause
 
07:12:33.110 --> 07:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
standard as opposed to reasonable
 
07:12:33.120 --> 07:12:34.230 align:start position:0%
standard as opposed to reasonable
suspicion

07:12:34.230 --> 07:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
suspicion
 
07:12:36.070 --> 07:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
and my support for that was well what if
 
07:12:38.070 --> 07:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
the communication common carrier didn't
 
07:12:40.070 --> 07:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to provide the information
 
07:12:41.510 --> 07:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
some of some of these companies pride
 
07:12:43.510 --> 07:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
themselves on protecting our information
 
07:12:45.910 --> 07:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
not just freely handing it over to the
 
07:12:51.430 --> 07:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:51.440 --> 07:12:52.628 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:12:52.628 --> 07:12:52.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:12:54.150 --> 07:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
i thought that
 
07:12:55.350 --> 07:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
i thought there was nothing wrong with a
 
07:12:57.590 --> 07:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
probable cause standard
 
07:12:57.600 --> 07:12:58.548 align:start position:0%
probable cause standard
but

07:12:58.548 --> 07:12:58.558 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:13:00.230 --> 07:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
this what this is doing it doesn't say
 
07:13:01.830 --> 07:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
probable cause but it's it's the same
 
07:13:03.910 --> 07:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
thing it's making it
 
07:13:07.030 --> 07:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
you get a valid search warrant
 
07:13:08.548 --> 07:13:08.558 align:start position:0%
before before the records could be
 
07:13:10.548 --> 07:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
turned over which is a probable cause
 
07:13:12.230 --> 07:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
standard to get a search warrant so this
 
07:13:13.670 --> 07:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
is i'm just saying that to me it's the
 
07:13:16.070 --> 07:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
same subject matter now again we don't
 
07:13:17.590 --> 07:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
make that
 
07:13:19.510 --> 07:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative wallace is correct that's
 
07:13:20.868 --> 07:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
for this
 
07:13:23.510 --> 07:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
president of the body we shall not
 
07:13:25.510 --> 07:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
speak of to make
 
07:13:26.868 --> 07:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
i really don't like that rule that we
 
07:13:28.150 --> 07:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
can't just
 
07:13:29.670 --> 07:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
say we can't say we can't just say
 
07:13:31.110 --> 07:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the title but
 
07:13:31.120 --> 07:13:32.868 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the title but
anyway

07:13:32.868 --> 07:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
07:13:34.230 --> 07:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's the same exact thing it
 
07:13:35.910 --> 07:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
covers the same subject matter it even
 
07:13:37.510 --> 07:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
has the same
 
07:13:40.150 --> 07:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's the same purpose it's just written
 
07:13:41.590 --> 07:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
in the dif it's written differently but
 
07:13:44.548 --> 07:13:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:46.948 --> 07:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
07:13:48.868 --> 07:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh i heard that there was a it was
 
07:13:50.788 --> 07:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
question of the chair
 
07:13:54.310 --> 07:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
i heard a motion to uh on this bill but
 
07:13:58.070 --> 07:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:01.110 --> 07:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
no one was recognized for a motion uh
 
07:14:04.468 --> 07:14:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:06.628 --> 07:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
if there is no emotion on the floor then
 
07:14:08.788 --> 07:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
what are we discussing i'm just i was
 
07:14:10.310 --> 07:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
just discussing that
 
07:14:13.110 --> 07:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
issue before i recognized someone for i
 
07:14:15.110 --> 07:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know
 
07:14:16.788 --> 07:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
thank you and then it turned into a very
 
07:14:29.750 --> 07:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:32.788 --> 07:14:32.798 align:start position:0%
representative catherine
 
07:14:39.270 --> 07:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:41.510 --> 07:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make a motion to itl this
 
07:14:43.430 --> 07:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
 
07:14:43.440 --> 07:14:46.708 align:start position:0%
bill thank you
second

07:14:46.708 --> 07:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:49.190 --> 07:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
that has been seconded by representative
 
07:14:49.200 --> 07:15:11.510 align:start position:0%
that has been seconded by representative
pantologist

07:15:11.510 --> 07:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:12.788 --> 07:15:12.798 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized for
 
07:15:14.310 --> 07:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
your point of order i believe it is
 
07:15:17.110 --> 07:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
customary and uh uh
 
07:15:19.990 --> 07:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
customary in this to announce the bill
 
07:15:21.990 --> 07:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we're getting ready to vote on and
 
07:15:24.788 --> 07:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
i have not heard any announcement of
 
07:15:26.868 --> 07:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
whatever bill i'm supposed to be talking
 
07:15:26.878 --> 07:15:29.190 align:start position:0%
whatever bill i'm supposed to be talking
about

07:15:29.190 --> 07:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
07:15:29.200 --> 07:15:30.150 align:start position:0%
about
you

07:15:30.150 --> 07:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:15:31.270 --> 07:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your point of order i
 
07:15:33.990 --> 07:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
heard a motion to this bill
 
07:15:34.000 --> 07:15:35.030 align:start position:0%
heard a motion to this bill
well

07:15:35.030 --> 07:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:15:37.030 --> 07:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
i are you saying that the way the
 
07:15:37.040 --> 07:15:38.310 align:start position:0%
i are you saying that the way the
representative

07:15:38.310 --> 07:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
07:15:39.510 --> 07:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
did because they didn't say the bill
 
07:15:39.520 --> 07:15:41.670 align:start position:0%
did because they didn't say the bill
number

07:15:41.670 --> 07:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
number
 
07:15:43.510 --> 07:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
i guess what i guess what i'm saying is
 
07:15:46.948 --> 07:15:46.958 align:start position:0%
if the motion is to itl this bill that
 
07:15:48.788 --> 07:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
is an improper motion
 
07:15:52.788 --> 07:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
can't itl make a move to itl
 
07:15:55.590 --> 07:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
this bill what bill well we are in the
 
07:15:57.270 --> 07:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
middle of an executive session for house
 
07:15:59.030 --> 07:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill 1282.
 
07:16:01.110 --> 07:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
so i although i don't i i'm not sure
 
07:16:02.708 --> 07:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
what the representative said if if the
 
07:16:04.868 --> 07:16:04.878 align:start position:0%
representative did say this bill during
 
07:16:06.548 --> 07:16:06.558 align:start position:0%
an executive session
 
07:16:08.948 --> 07:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
on hb 1282 i would assume they were
 
07:16:11.270 --> 07:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
referring to hp 1282. i didn't even hear
 
07:16:13.510 --> 07:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we called an executive session on
 
07:16:13.520 --> 07:16:15.430 align:start position:0%
that we called an executive session on
1282.

07:16:15.430 --> 07:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
1282.
 
07:16:16.788 --> 07:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
we are
 
07:16:18.788 --> 07:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
i did not hear that called
 
07:16:30.548 --> 07:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:32.948 --> 07:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
07:16:35.350 --> 07:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative roy did you
 
07:16:35.360 --> 07:16:36.548 align:start position:0%
representative roy did you
understand

07:16:36.548 --> 07:16:36.558 align:start position:0%
understand
 
07:16:38.788 --> 07:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
the senate rule to say that they would
 
07:16:42.150 --> 07:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:44.788 --> 07:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
the senate did not tell me they would
 
07:16:47.110 --> 07:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
not accept it they sent me a copy of the
 
07:16:50.230 --> 07:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
rule after i sent them the bill numbers
 
07:16:53.030 --> 07:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
and i understand the bill number to be
 
07:16:54.948 --> 07:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
that this is the same
 
07:16:57.510 --> 07:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
um exact wording of the of the rules
 
07:16:59.110 --> 07:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
subject matter
 
07:17:00.868 --> 07:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of how we tweaked it it's the
 
07:17:02.708 --> 07:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
same subject matter they wouldn't be
 
07:17:04.468 --> 07:17:04.478 align:start position:0%
able to take it up but
 
07:17:06.150 --> 07:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
having said that this body is free to
 
07:17:08.708 --> 07:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
make whatever recommendation it wishes
 
07:17:10.628 --> 07:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you that that doesn't necessarily
 
07:17:11.910 --> 07:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and just because they won't accept
 
07:17:13.750 --> 07:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean it should necessarily
 
07:17:14.948 --> 07:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
affect what you're going to do just
 
07:17:18.948 --> 07:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:21.270 --> 07:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative burt
 
07:17:24.070 --> 07:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
07:17:26.310 --> 07:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the 12 years i've been here we have
 
07:17:26.320 --> 07:17:27.350 align:start position:0%
in the 12 years i've been here we have
never

07:17:27.350 --> 07:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
never
 
07:17:29.510 --> 07:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
itl the bill
 
07:17:31.430 --> 07:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
because the other body
 
07:17:33.270 --> 07:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
may not bring it up
 
07:17:35.350 --> 07:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
because the only person that i know of
 
07:17:38.468 --> 07:17:38.478 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out that can say yes this
 
07:17:40.708 --> 07:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
language is the same is the speaker of
 
07:17:46.310 --> 07:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:46.320 --> 07:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
huh

07:17:47.750 --> 07:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
huh
 
07:17:50.150 --> 07:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
or the senate president
 
07:17:52.788 --> 07:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
so it just disturbs me that we are
 
07:17:55.670 --> 07:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
acting on a rule
 
07:17:58.868 --> 07:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
from the senate
 
07:18:01.030 --> 07:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
so with that said i you know i like the
 
07:18:03.750 --> 07:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill i'm going to support it uh because
 
07:18:07.030 --> 07:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
as they said you know between 2018 um
 
07:18:09.110 --> 07:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
the ag dude guy
 
07:18:12.830 --> 07:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
2018 to 2021 41 to 43
 
07:18:12.840 --> 07:18:14.548 align:start position:0%
2018 to 2021 41 to 43
requests

07:18:14.548 --> 07:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
requests
 
07:18:16.230 --> 07:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
were used
 
07:18:18.310 --> 07:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
under this program
 
07:18:21.750 --> 07:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
to get information even minimal
 
07:18:21.760 --> 07:18:25.270 align:start position:0%
to get information even minimal
information

07:18:25.270 --> 07:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:27.110 --> 07:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
without a warrant
 
07:18:27.120 --> 07:18:28.388 align:start position:0%
without a warrant
and

07:18:28.388 --> 07:18:28.398 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:18:29.990 --> 07:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know he wouldn't he wouldn't answer
 
07:18:31.910 --> 07:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
the question which i think was asked a
 
07:18:33.590 --> 07:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
couple times
 
07:18:35.590 --> 07:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
how long does it take
 
07:18:37.590 --> 07:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
well he would tell you how long it takes
 
07:18:39.750 --> 07:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
to get this under this program you know
 
07:18:42.310 --> 07:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
the 41 to 43 times if that's an accurate
 
07:18:42.320 --> 07:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
the 41 to 43 times if that's an accurate
number

07:18:43.510 --> 07:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
number
 
07:18:43.520 --> 07:18:44.310 align:start position:0%
number
of

07:18:44.310 --> 07:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:18:48.070 --> 07:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:50.468 --> 07:18:50.478 align:start position:0%
but he never answered how quick he he
 
07:18:52.388 --> 07:18:52.398 align:start position:0%
could do a um
 
07:18:54.708 --> 07:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
a warrant and i wanted to know that
 
07:18:54.718 --> 07:18:56.468 align:start position:0%
a warrant and i wanted to know that
because

07:18:56.468 --> 07:18:56.478 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:18:59.190 --> 07:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
that is the way it should be we must
 
07:19:01.910 --> 07:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
have warrants you know and you know 60
 
07:19:03.990 --> 07:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
percent of it he says is for
 
07:19:05.990 --> 07:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
07:19:07.910 --> 07:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know children again you know crimes
 
07:19:09.510 --> 07:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
against children so
 
07:19:11.110 --> 07:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know yes we need to hurry up and
 
07:19:13.350 --> 07:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
find out that information
 
07:19:15.190 --> 07:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
if that's the case
 
07:19:17.910 --> 07:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
but there's still laws that we should
 
07:19:20.388 --> 07:19:20.398 align:start position:0%
follow and if this is a loophole or
 
07:19:22.708 --> 07:19:22.718 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they use or maybe
 
07:19:24.388 --> 07:19:24.398 align:start position:0%
it's a law that they use
 
07:19:26.150 --> 07:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
um this program that they talked that
 
07:19:26.160 --> 07:19:27.030 align:start position:0%
um this program that they talked that
number

07:19:27.030 --> 07:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
07:19:29.830 --> 07:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
um you know we got to have
 
07:19:32.468 --> 07:19:32.478 align:start position:0%
warrants for all of this
 
07:19:32.478 --> 07:19:33.270 align:start position:0%
warrants for all of this
and

07:19:33.270 --> 07:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:19:35.430 --> 07:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
again you know it just disturbs me that
 
07:19:38.310 --> 07:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
we are acting on what the other body is
 
07:19:40.388 --> 07:19:40.398 align:start position:0%
going to do or their rules
 
07:19:41.990 --> 07:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
um when the speaker should be
 
07:19:45.030 --> 07:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
determining if this is different because
 
07:19:47.430 --> 07:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
bottom line it's not different i looked
 
07:19:47.440 --> 07:19:48.788 align:start position:0%
bottom line it's not different i looked
up

07:19:48.788 --> 07:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:19:50.230 --> 07:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
a minute yup
 
07:19:51.430 --> 07:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
you were recognized for your point of
 
07:19:53.350 --> 07:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
order please take your point of order
 
07:19:56.388 --> 07:19:56.398 align:start position:0%
uh usually when before we start
 
07:19:59.350 --> 07:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
debate with other members we offer
 
07:19:59.360 --> 07:20:00.310 align:start position:0%
debate with other members we offer
the

07:20:00.310 --> 07:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:20:03.190 --> 07:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
person who offered the motion the
 
07:20:05.670 --> 07:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak and i have not
 
07:20:08.150 --> 07:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
heard that person speak yet
 
07:20:13.830 --> 07:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:18.948 --> 07:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:20.708 --> 07:20:20.718 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i'm not clear the rules
 
07:20:23.270 --> 07:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
actually say but i i apologize i think
 
07:20:24.548 --> 07:20:24.558 align:start position:0%
when she when the representative made
 
07:20:26.948 --> 07:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
the motion there was a point of order
 
07:20:28.868 --> 07:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
and i may not have gone back to the
 
07:20:30.628 --> 07:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative and i apologize to that
 
07:20:32.788 --> 07:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
but if it's all possible i suppose that
 
07:20:35.910 --> 07:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
is a rule that i did not follow
 
07:20:37.350 --> 07:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
would the representative from goffstown
 
07:20:39.110 --> 07:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
be permitted at least finish his
 
07:20:40.548 --> 07:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
dialogue before
 
07:20:40.558 --> 07:20:41.750 align:start position:0%
dialogue before
representing

07:20:41.750 --> 07:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
representing
 
07:20:46.670 --> 07:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:46.680 --> 07:20:50.628 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

07:20:50.628 --> 07:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:52.948 --> 07:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
but but you you may be actually correct
 
07:20:54.788 --> 07:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
i'm just i didn't mean any disrespect
 
07:20:57.110 --> 07:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
but i just would prefer him to
 
07:21:02.070 --> 07:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:04.628 --> 07:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
do you would drive the point of order
 
07:21:09.830 --> 07:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:11.590 --> 07:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
all right and
 
07:21:13.350 --> 07:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
the reality of it is i don't even have
 
07:21:15.190 --> 07:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
to say anything but i'm going to say
 
07:21:16.788 --> 07:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
something since you brought that to the
 
07:21:18.388 --> 07:21:18.398 align:start position:0%
attention of everyone
 
07:21:18.398 --> 07:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
attention of everyone
um

07:21:21.110 --> 07:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:24.948 --> 07:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
i thought he was finished i'm sorry no
 
07:21:27.830 --> 07:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:30.788 --> 07:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
so i think my last thoughts were
 
07:21:32.628 --> 07:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
you know the speaker needs to make the
 
07:21:34.548 --> 07:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
determination because when i look back
 
07:21:38.708 --> 07:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
at house bill 539 yes the
 
07:21:41.510 --> 07:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
intent is the same but the words are
 
07:21:41.520 --> 07:21:42.468 align:start position:0%
intent is the same but the words are
different

07:21:42.468 --> 07:21:42.478 align:start position:0%
different
 
07:21:45.590 --> 07:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
because what i look at is we v we
 
07:21:49.670 --> 07:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
itl a lot of marijuana bills
 
07:21:51.990 --> 07:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
then we pass some marijuana bills the
 
07:21:54.468 --> 07:21:54.478 align:start position:0%
intent is the same it's to legalize
 
07:21:54.478 --> 07:21:56.388 align:start position:0%
intent is the same it's to legalize
marijuana

07:21:56.388 --> 07:21:56.398 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
07:21:59.590 --> 07:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
but the language is a little different
 
07:22:02.150 --> 07:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
so that's why i am looking at this going
 
07:22:02.160 --> 07:22:02.948 align:start position:0%
so that's why i am looking at this going
no

07:22:02.948 --> 07:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:22:06.070 --> 07:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
no i'm going to uh go against the itl
 
07:22:08.388 --> 07:22:08.398 align:start position:0%
and support a another motion if that's
 
07:22:09.990 --> 07:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
gets to that point
 
07:22:11.910 --> 07:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
and you know because we do this all the
 
07:22:14.548 --> 07:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
time we vote bills down
 
07:22:17.190 --> 07:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
of the same topic and support other
 
07:22:19.510 --> 07:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
bills of the same topic
 
07:22:22.070 --> 07:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's why i want the speaker to see
 
07:22:24.868 --> 07:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
this bill to determine if it's germaine
 
07:22:27.590 --> 07:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
or not thank you
 
07:22:29.750 --> 07:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify the
 
07:22:31.190 --> 07:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
whether this is
 
07:22:32.868 --> 07:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
a similar subject matter would be for
 
07:22:34.868 --> 07:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
the not even for the house to decide it
 
07:22:36.070 --> 07:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
07:22:38.708 --> 07:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:40.708 --> 07:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
representative herrick that's right
 
07:22:42.150 --> 07:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'll say it again
 
07:22:44.150 --> 07:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
um i'm making a motion
 
07:22:45.750 --> 07:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
to itl
 
07:22:49.190 --> 07:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
hb 1282.
 
07:22:49.200 --> 07:22:50.070 align:start position:0%
hb 1282.
um

07:22:50.070 --> 07:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:51.750 --> 07:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
i listen to this
 
07:22:51.760 --> 07:22:53.830 align:start position:0%
i listen to this
testimony

07:22:53.830 --> 07:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
07:22:55.910 --> 07:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
benjamin giddy i think his name was from
 
07:22:57.830 --> 07:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
the department of justice and when he
 
07:22:59.350 --> 07:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
talked about most of these crimes were
 
07:23:01.670 --> 07:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
60 to 70 percent of intimate internet
 
07:23:03.510 --> 07:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
crimes against children
 
07:23:07.190 --> 07:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
which is a big puppy of mine um
 
07:23:09.830 --> 07:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
and certain things have to happen almost
 
07:23:09.840 --> 07:23:11.030 align:start position:0%
and certain things have to happen almost
immediately

07:23:11.030 --> 07:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
07:23:14.548 --> 07:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
um i have to respect that because
 
07:23:16.708 --> 07:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
anything that you do against children in
 
07:23:19.270 --> 07:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
my in my opinion um
 
07:23:21.270 --> 07:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
we need to act on immediately but he
 
07:23:23.510 --> 07:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
also said that we also have these laws
 
07:23:26.230 --> 07:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
already it's in terms of warrants and he
 
07:23:27.430 --> 07:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
talked about two different type of
 
07:23:28.948 --> 07:23:28.958 align:start position:0%
warrants not quite that i really
 
07:23:30.310 --> 07:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
understood them but one was
 
07:23:31.990 --> 07:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
administrative and the other one was
 
07:23:35.190 --> 07:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
more on a search type basis but he said
 
07:23:37.030 --> 07:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
they had to get uh
 
07:23:38.948 --> 07:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
i think one was through superior court
 
07:23:40.868 --> 07:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
and the other warrant was through
 
07:23:42.948 --> 07:23:42.958 align:start position:0%
the attorney assistant attorney general
 
07:23:44.788 --> 07:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
so these things are really already in
 
07:23:44.798 --> 07:23:45.830 align:start position:0%
so these things are really already in
place

07:23:45.830 --> 07:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
place
 
07:23:48.070 --> 07:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
so with that said right now i don't
 
07:23:51.350 --> 07:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:54.070 --> 07:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time
 
07:23:56.150 --> 07:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i've also heard and know about the
 
07:23:57.270 --> 07:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
bill from
 
07:24:00.070 --> 07:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
last term 539
 
07:24:02.388 --> 07:24:02.398 align:start position:0%
so with that said again
 
07:24:07.030 --> 07:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
i wish to itl this bill
 
07:24:11.270 --> 07:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:12.628 --> 07:24:12.638 align:start position:0%
i just want to
 
07:24:14.468 --> 07:24:14.478 align:start position:0%
say that i agree with the explanation
 
07:24:16.548 --> 07:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
that was just given they have these
 
07:24:18.548 --> 07:24:18.558 align:start position:0%
administrative subpoenas i believe is
 
07:24:20.310 --> 07:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
what they call them and then they have
 
07:24:21.670 --> 07:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
the search warrant they have the option
 
07:24:23.270 --> 07:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
of either or
 
07:24:25.270 --> 07:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
and i believe the timeliness thing is a
 
07:24:25.280 --> 07:24:26.310 align:start position:0%
and i believe the timeliness thing is a
factor

07:24:26.310 --> 07:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
factor
 
07:24:27.670 --> 07:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
07:24:29.910 --> 07:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
i don't really care what body did
 
07:24:31.590 --> 07:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
something to what other body with this
 
07:24:33.350 --> 07:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
bill i'm just talking about what the
 
07:24:34.708 --> 07:24:34.718 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill is and i think
 
07:24:39.510 --> 07:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:42.628 --> 07:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:45.030 --> 07:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
i actually wrote the the minority report
 
07:24:46.548 --> 07:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
and voted against this bill the last
 
07:24:48.230 --> 07:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
time and one of the main reasons i did
 
07:24:49.830 --> 07:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
that was because the only person who
 
07:24:51.590 --> 07:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
came and testified in support of it was
 
07:24:53.030 --> 07:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
07:24:54.548 --> 07:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
and i really did want to hear from
 
07:24:56.150 --> 07:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
someone in the attorney general's office
 
07:24:57.350 --> 07:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
what the implications would be of
 
07:24:59.190 --> 07:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
passing this bill
 
07:25:01.350 --> 07:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
and you know the bottom line is it just
 
07:25:03.830 --> 07:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to do much um
 
07:25:06.388 --> 07:25:06.398 align:start position:0%
you know it would create uh
 
07:25:08.708 --> 07:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
it would essentially force the attorney
 
07:25:10.788 --> 07:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
general's office to go through some
 
07:25:12.948 --> 07:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
additional process work but one of the
 
07:25:14.948 --> 07:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
things that we're talking about here is
 
07:25:17.190 --> 07:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know with an administrative warrant
 
07:25:19.030 --> 07:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
what he's out what they're after
 
07:25:20.868 --> 07:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
initially isn't you know and he said
 
07:25:23.350 --> 07:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
this he says we're not after your after
 
07:25:25.110 --> 07:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
personal information we're not after
 
07:25:27.110 --> 07:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
your you know the internet sites you
 
07:25:28.788 --> 07:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
visited those are all things that we
 
07:25:30.948 --> 07:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
have to get a search warrant to find
 
07:25:32.548 --> 07:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
but basically what they are is they're
 
07:25:35.590 --> 07:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
trying to match an ip address that they
 
07:25:35.600 --> 07:25:36.468 align:start position:0%
trying to match an ip address that they
have

07:25:36.468 --> 07:25:36.478 align:start position:0%
have
 
07:25:38.788 --> 07:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
you know on internet child porn
 
07:25:42.310 --> 07:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
with ip addresses that the uh that the
 
07:25:43.990 --> 07:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
carrier would have
 
07:25:47.110 --> 07:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
and if once you get a match then
 
07:25:48.708 --> 07:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
what he was saying is we go for the
 
07:25:50.150 --> 07:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
search warrant
 
07:25:52.548 --> 07:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
so so to me it seems like the invest
 
07:25:54.388 --> 07:25:54.398 align:start position:0%
like the administrative procedure that
 
07:25:57.510 --> 07:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
they have right now is proper it allows
 
07:25:58.628 --> 07:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
them to
 
07:26:00.708 --> 07:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
to get the information they need pretty
 
07:26:02.788 --> 07:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
quickly uh and then if it's going to go
 
07:26:04.548 --> 07:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
any farther they need to get a warrant
 
07:26:07.190 --> 07:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
for it so i'm i'm a little stuck on why
 
07:26:10.150 --> 07:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
we would need the bill which is why i'm
 
07:26:16.468 --> 07:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:16.478 --> 07:26:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

07:26:19.190 --> 07:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:20.868 --> 07:26:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
07:26:23.190 --> 07:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
taking oh no um
 
07:26:23.200 --> 07:26:24.788 align:start position:0%
taking oh no um
so

07:26:24.788 --> 07:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:26:24.798 --> 07:26:26.230 align:start position:0%
so
uh

07:26:26.230 --> 07:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:26:29.670 --> 07:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
we passed a similar bill
 
07:26:29.680 --> 07:26:30.628 align:start position:0%
we passed a similar bill
um

07:26:30.628 --> 07:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:26:32.388 --> 07:26:32.398 align:start position:0%
last year
 
07:26:34.948 --> 07:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
now this committee is not bound by what
 
07:26:36.948 --> 07:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
this committee did last year i realized
 
07:26:39.830 --> 07:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
that however
 
07:26:41.750 --> 07:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
in reading the
 
07:26:43.990 --> 07:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
corrections from
 
07:26:45.830 --> 07:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
the changes from the bill that we
 
07:26:48.150 --> 07:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
thought was okay last year
 
07:26:50.150 --> 07:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
this bill now becomes an even better
 
07:26:55.190 --> 07:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:56.548 --> 07:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
07:26:59.190 --> 07:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
the way i read it is telling the
 
07:27:01.990 --> 07:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney general office
 
07:27:05.590 --> 07:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
that we have a constitutional right
 
07:27:07.990 --> 07:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
to our privacy
 
07:27:09.670 --> 07:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
and if they want to start poking their
 
07:27:12.788 --> 07:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
nose into our privacy they must have a
 
07:27:14.468 --> 07:27:14.478 align:start position:0%
search warrant
 
07:27:16.788 --> 07:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
not an administrative form
 
07:27:19.110 --> 07:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
they must have a search warrant and if
 
07:27:21.910 --> 07:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
they can get that search warrant
 
07:27:23.990 --> 07:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
then i my privacy
 
07:27:25.270 --> 07:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be looked into because they
 
07:27:28.070 --> 07:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
have probable cause they have the search
 
07:27:28.080 --> 07:27:29.430 align:start position:0%
have probable cause they have the search
warrant

07:27:29.430 --> 07:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
07:27:32.388 --> 07:27:32.398 align:start position:0%
this is just a better bill
 
07:27:34.388 --> 07:27:34.398 align:start position:0%
that was a good bill
 
07:27:36.468 --> 07:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
last year
 
07:27:41.110 --> 07:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:42.948 --> 07:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
all i know is
 
07:27:45.190 --> 07:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house
 
07:27:45.200 --> 07:27:46.868 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house
decides

07:27:46.868 --> 07:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
decides
 
07:27:48.708 --> 07:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
and has already decided because he sent
 
07:27:50.868 --> 07:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
this bill to our committee
 
07:27:53.430 --> 07:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
he's already decided that this is a good
 
07:27:56.548 --> 07:27:56.558 align:start position:0%
this is a a proper bill
 
07:27:56.558 --> 07:27:58.230 align:start position:0%
this is a a proper bill
um

07:27:58.230 --> 07:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:28:00.388 --> 07:28:00.398 align:start position:0%
and why wouldn't he because we passed it
 
07:28:02.868 --> 07:28:02.878 align:start position:0%
last year or a similar bill last year
 
07:28:04.708 --> 07:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
and therefore we can pass a similar bill
 
07:28:06.708 --> 07:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
this year
 
07:28:06.718 --> 07:28:09.910 align:start position:0%
this year
what

07:28:09.910 --> 07:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:13.030 --> 07:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
what the senate may or may not do
 
07:28:16.150 --> 07:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
has no bearing on how i will vote or a
 
07:28:18.788 --> 07:28:18.798 align:start position:0%
reason why i will vote for or against
 
07:28:20.150 --> 07:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
07:28:23.110 --> 07:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
did i say that word i meant they who
 
07:28:26.070 --> 07:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
shall not be mentioned
 
07:28:28.830 --> 07:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
because i don't care what they might do
 
07:28:31.590 --> 07:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow doesn't affect whether we've
 
07:28:33.590 --> 07:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
got a good bill today
 
07:28:35.910 --> 07:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
07:28:37.350 --> 07:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and i do agree with the
 
07:28:39.590 --> 07:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional side because if the
 
07:28:41.350 --> 07:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
communication common carry does not want
 
07:28:44.150 --> 07:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
to comply with these this administrative
 
07:28:45.830 --> 07:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
request the fourth amendment says
 
07:28:48.788 --> 07:28:48.798 align:start position:0%
probable cause i don't understand
 
07:28:50.868 --> 07:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
what the what's going on here i is i
 
07:28:52.788 --> 07:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
understand there's a public
 
07:28:54.468 --> 07:28:54.478 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
07:28:56.150 --> 07:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying the the
 
07:28:57.510 --> 07:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
witness from the attorney general's
 
07:28:58.788 --> 07:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
office didn't make good points on what
 
07:29:00.150 --> 07:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
they're trying to accomplish but the
 
07:29:02.468 --> 07:29:02.478 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment says probable cause so
 
07:29:04.388 --> 07:29:04.398 align:start position:0%
if the communication common carry does
 
07:29:06.230 --> 07:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
not want to participate
 
07:29:07.990 --> 07:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
or voluntarily
 
07:29:09.350 --> 07:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know cooperate with said
 
07:29:09.360 --> 07:29:10.868 align:start position:0%
you know cooperate with said
investigation

07:29:10.868 --> 07:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
07:29:12.388 --> 07:29:12.398 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why there's no probable
 
07:29:14.070 --> 07:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
cause standard there i i don't know that
 
07:29:15.830 --> 07:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
was my speech on the
 
07:29:17.110 --> 07:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
for the whole house
 
07:29:18.788 --> 07:29:18.798 align:start position:0%
but it didn't
 
07:29:20.070 --> 07:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
apparently didn't work very well in the
 
07:29:20.080 --> 07:29:20.868 align:start position:0%
apparently didn't work very well in the
other

07:29:20.868 --> 07:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:29:20.878 --> 07:29:22.708 align:start position:0%
other
body

07:29:22.708 --> 07:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
body
 
07:29:25.190 --> 07:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:27.670 --> 07:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
represents plain
 
07:29:29.830 --> 07:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
07:29:31.590 --> 07:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
i agree with
 
07:29:33.190 --> 07:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative muse on
 
07:29:35.190 --> 07:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of his
 
07:29:37.990 --> 07:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
discussion of where this goes
 
07:29:39.670 --> 07:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
the administrative warrant from my
 
07:29:41.350 --> 07:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
understanding and from what he said only
 
07:29:43.110 --> 07:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
allows them to get
 
07:29:45.110 --> 07:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
did they access this and what ip address
 
07:29:47.030 --> 07:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
was linked to it then they got to go get
 
07:29:48.708 --> 07:29:48.718 align:start position:0%
the regular warrant
 
07:29:50.708 --> 07:29:50.718 align:start position:0%
so i don't see where passing this bill
 
07:29:52.830 --> 07:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
causes a problem
 
07:29:52.840 --> 07:29:54.388 align:start position:0%
causes a problem
because

07:29:54.388 --> 07:29:54.398 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:29:55.670 --> 07:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
if they get the warrant in the first
 
07:29:58.548 --> 07:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
place they get all the information
 
07:29:59.750 --> 07:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they don't have to deal with the
 
07:30:03.190 --> 07:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
administrative warrant or administrative
 
07:30:05.590 --> 07:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh subpoena request
 
07:30:07.430 --> 07:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it protects the fourth amendment
 
07:30:07.440 --> 07:30:08.628 align:start position:0%
and it protects the fourth amendment
rights

07:30:08.628 --> 07:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
rights
 
07:30:11.030 --> 07:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
and and it protects our constitutional
 
07:30:19.190 --> 07:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:22.708 --> 07:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
so if unless someone has not had an
 
07:30:24.310 --> 07:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak this do they wish
 
07:30:25.830 --> 07:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
to speak otherwise i think at this point
 
07:30:31.670 --> 07:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:33.350 --> 07:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
about to move the question yeah i
 
07:30:35.670 --> 07:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
understand that so the question for us
 
07:30:38.070 --> 07:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
is an itl however if we don't itl and we
 
07:30:40.868 --> 07:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
choose to otp it it could go
 
07:30:43.830 --> 07:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
either the speaker could rule it as as
 
07:30:46.310 --> 07:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
void or it could go to the senate and
 
07:30:47.750 --> 07:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
the senate would really like one regret
 
07:30:49.510 --> 07:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
i have is bringing up any kind of
 
07:30:51.030 --> 07:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
complicated i'm trying to do this
 
07:30:52.468 --> 07:30:52.478 align:start position:0%
outside the community trying to
 
07:30:54.388 --> 07:30:54.398 align:start position:0%
understand what we're doing if what the
 
07:30:55.830 --> 07:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
implications are and
 
07:30:58.150 --> 07:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
the issue it wouldn't even be in in the
 
07:30:59.590 --> 07:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
house it would be what happened if it
 
07:31:01.430 --> 07:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
passes the house would they be be able
 
07:31:04.388 --> 07:31:04.398 align:start position:0%
to act on it i can representative true
 
07:31:06.628 --> 07:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
is correct that that has no bearing on
 
07:31:09.510 --> 07:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
this committee whatsoever the policy is
 
07:31:11.430 --> 07:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
really what we should be deciding
 
07:31:14.150 --> 07:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
um so although i believe
 
07:31:16.070 --> 07:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
that this anyone who reads this is going
 
07:31:17.910 --> 07:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
to find that the material substantially
 
07:31:20.070 --> 07:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
similar and therefore make that said
 
07:31:21.670 --> 07:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
ruling i am not the one that makes that
 
07:31:23.270 --> 07:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
ruling i have no influence over that
 
07:31:25.030 --> 07:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
person to make the ruling
 
07:31:26.788 --> 07:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
and with that being said i think the
 
07:31:27.990 --> 07:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
point was being made should that
 
07:31:29.750 --> 07:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
influence how
 
07:31:31.430 --> 07:31:31.440 align:start position:0%

07:31:32.708 --> 07:31:32.718 align:start position:0%

that as well so would you be preparing
 
07:36:02.310 --> 07:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
