representative turcott to lead us in the
 
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.149 align:start position:0%
representative turcott to lead us in the
pledge

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
of the United States of America and to
 
00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
the Republic for which it stands one
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
nation under God indivisible with
 
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
liberty and justice for all
 
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
um no housekeeping that I'm aware of to
 
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
start off
 
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I do see
 
00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
that we are going to be hearing three
 
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
bills this morning beginning at nine
 
00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 align:start position:0%
um actually we're starting with the cacr
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh then we go to two bills
 
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh there'll be a little break for us
 
00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 align:start position:0%
somewhere between the second and third
 
00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:33.890 align:start position:0%
somewhere between the second and third
one

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
um if everyone's good with that
 
00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.969 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
some note-taking gonna take place I
 
00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.290 align:start position:0%
some note-taking gonna take place I
guess

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
um good morning
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
um represent uh Senator Susie if you'd
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
like to join us at the witness table
 
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
welcome to the legislative
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
Administration certainly thank you Mr
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Donna soucy I
 
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
represent Senate District 18 comprised
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
of five Wards of the city of Manchester
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the town of
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
um cacr-10 is an attempt to resolve what
 
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
has been a question that for my many
 
00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 align:start position:0%
years of service I felt the need to
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
answer for members I want to make very
 
00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 align:start position:0%
clear from the outset this in no way
 
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
involves organization day so this does
 
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
not involve the legislative functions
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
that happen in December those remain in
 
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
the Constitution as they were drafted
 
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
the issue comes around the time of the
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
governor's inauguration
 
00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 align:start position:0%
right now the language of the
 
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
Constitution provides that the
 
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
legislature must meet
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
on the first Wednesday in January
 
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
and the governor's inauguration happens
 
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
on Thursday
 
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
for the house I understand there are
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
times where there is some business
 
00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 align:start position:0%
conducted and and that's fine in the
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
Senate we literally convene on the
 
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
Wednesday because the Constitution says
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
we have to convene we convene for no
 
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.070 align:start position:0%
we have to convene we convene for no
reason

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
it lasts about five minutes it requires
 
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
publicity publication of notice it
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
requires staff time requires payment of
 
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.249 align:start position:0%
requires staff time requires payment of
mileage

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 align:start position:0%
mileage
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
and the function that is anticipated is
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
something that goes back to the days of
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
horse and buggy and that was canvassing
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
the vote for the office of Governor
 
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
um I dare say that the resolution of the
 
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial election occurs long
 
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.969 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial election occurs long
before

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
we assemble in January and the function
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
is more celebratory in nature it's more
 
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
perfunctory so what the amendment would
 
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
do is have the
 
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.070 align:start position:0%
do is have the
um

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020 align:start position:0%
have the legislature meet on the
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
Thursday and I want to make very very
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
clear this does not preclude additional
 
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
meetings should the bodies choose to
 
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.370 align:start position:0%
meetings should the bodies choose to
meet

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Wednesday Monday or Friday of
 
00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 align:start position:0%
that week that's that's up to the bodies
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
to determine but what I'm trying to do
 
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
is eliminate the need to meet on both
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Thursday when there really
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
isn't an absolute function of the
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
legislature on Wednesday and I think
 
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of efficiency and a fair
 
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
question to put before the voters with
 
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:46.860 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative Constable did you not say
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
that you had 35 questions for uh each
 
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:05.460 align:start position:0%
I have uh I have one or two
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind
 
00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.629 align:start position:0%
um if you don't mind
um

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing by the the list of sponsors
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
and and with two exceptions
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
um it seems to be and and because this
 
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
has come out of the Senate I'm wondering
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
if if this is
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
um more for the
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
convenience of the Senate than it is the
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman it would apply it would
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
apply to either chamber but I it is my
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
understanding and I know the clerk is
 
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
here the house sometimes does conduct
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
other business on that day before I'm
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
not trying to preclude the house from
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
um the house could meet a little earlier
 
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
on Thursday and do the same business if
 
00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:58.620 align:start position:0%
it deems appropriate if not the house
 
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
could meet on Wednesday but what I'm
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
trying to do is eliminate the Wednesdays
 
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:04.980 align:start position:0%
being an absolute
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
okay so it may it may functionally
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impact the Senate
 
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
than it does the house but it in no way
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
dictates that the chamber couldn't meet
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
if the house should choose to I see
 
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:24.740 align:start position:0%
um I may have misspoken and said
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
convenience is it also a fiscal issue
 
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
and have you calculated there's
 
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
obviously no fiscal note with this but
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
is there is there was that part of the
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
consideration for the bill as well to
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
the extent that it requires two days in
 
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
a row of all members be ERS Byzantine
 
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.570 align:start position:0%
a row of all members be ERS Byzantine
Concord

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
hacked um if it were passed by the
 
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
voters it would cost the state of New
 
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:53.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a bit less because you
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be convening and therefore
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be paying mileage
 
00:09:57.839 --> 00:09:59.449 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be paying mileage
okay

00:09:59.449 --> 00:09:59.459 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
um you you wouldn't know uh offhand a
 
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
the amount that we're talking about I I
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't but I could attempt to uh get
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
the no just wondered whether that came
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
up in any of the conversations uh in the
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
Senate side
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
did you um
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to if there are questions
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
if anyone wants to just pop in that's
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
great with me
 
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.490 align:start position:0%
great with me
um

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
when this was heard in the Senate
 
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.769 align:start position:0%
when this was heard in the Senate
um

00:10:26.769 --> 00:10:26.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
what reaction did you receive from the
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
from the public on this was uh there
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't much public reaction I don't
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
think it's something that the public is
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
keenly aware of I think it's it's more
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
an internal function obviously the
 
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
question of whether to make this change
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
or not would be determined by the public
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
because it requires a vote
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
um but there was unanimous support in
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
um for the Constitutional Amendment
 
00:10:57.769 --> 00:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
because we see it as I said as an
 
00:10:59.690 --> 00:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
efficiency a convenience
 
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.590 align:start position:0%
efficiency a convenience
um

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:04.019 align:start position:0%
the language goes back a long long time
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
when our elections were conducted
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
differently and as I said you know
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
ballots were probably delivered by horse
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
and buggy at that time
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
um so this is just an update to what I
 
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
think is some very old language that
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect our current practices
 
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
um gubernatorial elections as we know we
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
have the results the night of the
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
election and if there is any dispute
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
very quickly following that those
 
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
disputes would be resolved through
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
recount or through the other legal
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
processes that we have so I once again I
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
would just ask that you look favorably
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
upon this I am not trying in any way to
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
preclude uh the work the house may
 
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
choose to do the day before the
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
governor's inauguration but I do want to
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
emphasize we will be organized as we
 
00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:56.459 align:start position:0%
typically are in December I'm in no way
 
00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
impacting any of that with the drafting
 
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
of this amendment great
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh further question yes representative
 
00:12:04.079 --> 00:12:06.050 align:start position:0%
uh further question yes representative
McCarter

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
McCarter
 
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:07.980 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you
 
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.690 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you
um

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
did you
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
I I apologize for being a little tardy
 
00:12:15.769 --> 00:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
so you may have already covered this
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
um was this something that
 
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:18.949 align:start position:0%
um was this something that
um

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
you were approached by outside of either
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
the senate or the legislature
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
to present as a bill or did you decide
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
to do this because you saw an issue that
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
needs to be rectified
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I saw an issue
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
that I thought needed to be addressed
 
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
and in speaking with Senate colleagues
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
at the time from from both parties uh
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
agreement as you can see from the
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
sponsors here there was significant
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
agreement that this is something that
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
made a lot of sense
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
brother follow-up no all set
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
um the only question I
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
I didn't pass a a group of protesters on
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
the way in here for uh for this
 
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
obviously and I and I'm I am
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
although I'm searching for it in vain
 
00:13:16.269 --> 00:13:16.279 align:start position:0%
the language that would be on the ballot
 
00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
when I first read it
 
00:13:22.329 --> 00:13:22.339 align:start position:0%
seemed a little awkward and I always
 
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
question whether
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
it would get full play
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
um you know anytime people see the first
 
00:13:32.449 --> 00:13:32.459 align:start position:0%
Thursday following the second Tuesday of
 
00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:33.350 align:start position:0%
Thursday following the second Tuesday of
the

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
um it that's about as far as most people
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
go on the question so
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that it would get
 
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
on the ballot here it is are you in
 
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
favor of amending articles 3 4 42 66 to
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
read as follows
 
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.389 align:start position:0%
read as follows
um

00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
when when the House and Senate shall
 
00:13:57.769 --> 00:13:57.779 align:start position:0%
assemble biannually on the first
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
Wednesday in December for organizational
 
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:01.329 align:start position:0%
Wednesday in December for organizational
days

00:14:01.329 --> 00:14:01.339 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
and shall assemble annually on the first
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
Thursday following the first Wednesday
 
00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:08.300 align:start position:0%
in January
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's where I think most
 
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
of our voters will stop
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering
 
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.009 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering
how

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
we should think
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
if we only have
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
30 people that finally that follow this
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
kind of process vote on it which may be
 
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
all of the Senators that vote on that
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
day and you know six members of the
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
public is that
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
a good reason for us to change how we
 
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.949 align:start position:0%
a good reason for us to change how we
operate

00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
with so few people paying attention on
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
I think it's always good to examine how
 
00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
we operate to find efficiencies in this
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
case if it were a statute Mr chairman it
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
would be easy and we would all you know
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
I think perhaps not our heads okay this
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
makes sense let's make this change
 
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.329 align:start position:0%
makes sense let's make this change
yeah

00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339 align:start position:0%
I mean the Constitution is a document
 
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we have had to amend for various
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
reasons this committee probably consider
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
or maybe Judiciary considered the issue
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
around probate
 
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
and registers of probate and there's
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
language about the sheriff and a lot of
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
the languages are cane it's just given
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
that we are one of the oldest States one
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
of the first states to form there is
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
language in our Constitution that dates
 
00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:38.779 align:start position:0%
back more than 200 years and
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
you're correct Mr chair I I agree with
 
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:44.180 align:start position:0%
your assessment that it may not be
 
00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
language that's easily digested by the
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
general public but I I don't see that as
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
an impediment to putting the question
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
forward and for folks like myself and
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
others to communicate about what this
 
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
would do just recently the Senate did
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
pass the Constitutional Amendment the
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn and I sponsored to
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
put the issue of updating the judicial
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
retirement age before the voters this
 
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
would be another question and I think
 
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
given that there could be the potential
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
for more than one question
 
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
um there could be more activity and more
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
discussion to inform voters about what
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
these important issues are so that they
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
can make those decisions come November
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
24th November of 2024 pardon me great
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much up we do have one
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
addition thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%
very much for coming in today I'm still
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
trying to to grasp what improvements
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
would we see from this in the function
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
of the house or even the governor's
 
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
office do we see something changing in a
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
positive way
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
what we would see is that instead of
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
that first week in January both bodies
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
convening on both Wednesday and Thursday
 
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
we would convene we would only be
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you because as I said
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
over many years I was frequently asked
 
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
the question what is it that we're doing
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
here why are we will the Constitution
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
requires us to be here and that's why on
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
Wednesday both bodies assemble as I said
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
if if one chamber or both choose to meet
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
on that Tuesday or Wednesday nothing
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
precludes them from meeting
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
this just eliminates a requirement to me
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
both days
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
but you would see
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
you believe that if if the requirement
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
was removed for speaking on or for
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
attending on both days you believe that
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
one or both houses would
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
someone would only meet on one day yes
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay I believe at least one all right if
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
not both all right
 
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't speak on behalf of
 
00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:03.860 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
any more than any of us speak for the
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
Senate right thank you very much
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:18.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
we have only one other pink card
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
um brought To Us by uh
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.010 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is my favorite committee uh Paul
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
Smith Clerk of the house uh testifying
 
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the speaker of the house
 
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
today uh who is opposed to the cacr I
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
want to make it clear the Constitution
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
does not require us to meet on two
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
separate days at this point it does not
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
require us to meet on two separate days
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
at this point that being said I want to
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
give you some some history I asked Myla
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
Patton in the research office the
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
question regarding convening day being
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
separated from the installation of the
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
governor she assembled information that
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
showed the convening of the legislature
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
occurred sometime before but in many
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
cases the day before or in the case of
 
00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
1784 the president's inauguration during
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
the following years and she used this on
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
a decade by decade basis 1784 18 19 1885
 
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
1897 1899 1903 1913 1923 1933 1943 1953
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
1963 1973 1983 so that's just a brief
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
snap snapshot of when it it is either a
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
day before or in the case of
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
1819 it was a week and a half before
 
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
so the practical
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
convening day is a work day for the
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear we go into joint
 
00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.049 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear we go into joint
convention

00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.059 align:start position:0%
convention
 
00:19:58.730 --> 00:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
because that is required by the
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
Constitution we go into joint convention
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
with the Senate uh hear the report from
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
and there's there's one important piece
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
here and yes it hasn't been used but
 
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
if a plurality for governor isn't
 
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.289 align:start position:0%
if a plurality for governor isn't
attained

00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
attained
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
it is up to the general court in joint
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
session convened to determine the winner
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that's an important part of that
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
joint convention
 
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
after we hear the Secretary of State's
 
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
report we adjourn and usually spend the
 
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
next several hours discussing amendments
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
to house rules that will impact us for
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
the biennium on the top of our
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
introduction of normal house bills
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
the next day the house convenes we come
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
in for joint convention and go into the
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
governor's inauguration immediately
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
adjourn why do we do this well beyond
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
the usual custom usage and precedent
 
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
that you hear from me it's the
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
governor's day and as she or he is
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
required to be sworn in in the presence
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
of both houses can consistent with part
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
two article 85 we have historically
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
opted to give the governor extensive use
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the chamber and galleries for guests
 
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
civil servants and family members while
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
accommodating the members of the house
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
and the Senate who wish to be there
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
it's important to note we do not take
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
votes on inauguration day those wishing
 
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
to not attend don't have absences
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
the Senate has in modern times opted not
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be in session beyond their
 
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
constitutionally mandated meeting with
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
us on convening day typically they
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
handle their deadlines on organization
 
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:39.260 align:start position:0%
day having worked that out among their
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
testimony smaller chamber and their
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
rules don't change as frequently as ours
 
00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:44.990 align:start position:0%
rules don't change as frequently as ours
do

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
so from their perspective this certainly
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
makes sense they don't have the work to
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
do so why not just come in for one day
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
the reality is with the house working a
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
full day we could accommodate the
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
centuries-old practice but
 
00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:00.659 align:start position:0%
it would mean essentially that we would
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
not provide any space for the new
 
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
governor for the purposes of the
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
inauguration and frankly by the letter
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution we are also not
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
required to accept an address from the
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
governor at that point though we have
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
also maintained that centuries-old
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
practice as well as entering them into
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
our Journal
 
00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
so let me be clear we could do this all
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
on one day bring the governor in have
 
00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
the Chief Justice swear them in the
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
presence of the house and the Senate and
 
00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:27.299 align:start position:0%
immediately invite the governor to leave
 
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:30.059 align:start position:0%
so that we can do our business
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
but again historically we have opted not
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
to do that because courtesy between
 
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.610 align:start position:0%
to do that because courtesy between
branches

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
branches
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that a quorum of the
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
Senate which is 13 is all that is
 
00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
necessary to show and arrive on those
 
00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:45.299 align:start position:0%
two January dates if they don't have any
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
other legislative business requiring
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
their attention
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
if this amendment goes to the voters
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
technically I'm not sure that most folks
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
understand the terminology in fact as
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
the chair brought up the
 
00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.370 align:start position:0%
the chair brought up the
uh

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
provision last year regarding the
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
registers of probate it was a confusing
 
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:09.260 align:start position:0%
language it failed
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
closely because of the confusing
 
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
language I received many calls in my
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
office from voters I spent 45 minutes on
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
the phone uh with the lady representing
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
the league of conference conservation
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
voters trying to explain the the Nuance
 
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:26.700 align:start position:0%
of the detail and that's not my job uh
 
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140 align:start position:0%
to be honest but I I do wonder about uh
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
how this is is worded
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
and I I think beyond the 24 who
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
obviously would benefit from this change
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think the 400 in this chamber
 
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.289 align:start position:0%
I don't think the 400 in this chamber
would

00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
so again on behalf of the speaker uh he
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
is opposed to the cacr
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
ify thank you Mr clerk um any you will
 
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.059 --> 00:24:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
yes sure
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
this is just for explanation for me I'm
 
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
also a selectman in Northumberland
 
00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:14.299 align:start position:0%
and page
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
two line three uh change at line five
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the Selectmen of all town cities
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
Wards and plate and places in the state
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
are directed to in certain their
 
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.409 align:start position:0%
are directed to in certain their
warrants

00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:27.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
I've never done a warrant for a general
 
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
election that I can recall
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
the ballots are sent to us
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh and it wouldn't be at our town
 
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
meeting because that's in March
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
what are we being told to do
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
I think the the correct person to ask
 
00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
that question of would be the sponsor
 
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.370 align:start position:0%
that question of would be the sponsor
okay

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
because it's not written in italics so
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
that um as I understand it that's
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
that's not being changed that's existing
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
language so that may be something that
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
we wanna
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
take up with
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state that that's the
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
question I basically got is
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
as far as I know we don't do that
 
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.190 align:start position:0%
as far as I know we don't do that
well

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
um again we'll um we'll
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
we'll inquire of the Secretary of State
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
and see if we can get us some
 
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
information for you on that
 
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.330 align:start position:0%
information for you on that
um

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
and that somewhat does go to to the
 
00:25:45.659 --> 00:25:46.730 align:start position:0%
and that somewhat does go to to the
point

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
that that a lot of this section
 
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.830 align:start position:0%
that that a lot of this section
um

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
is internal language for how we operate
 
00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:57.830 align:start position:0%
is internal language for how we operate
um

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
the one piece that you've pulled out
 
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.370 align:start position:0%
the one piece that you've pulled out
here

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
does affect the rest of the state but
 
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
generally what we're bringing up in this
 
00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
or what the sponsor is bringing up in
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
this amendment is dealing with our
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
internal organization so
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
um I think I think we'll get an answer
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
to that but we'll get it outside the
 
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
scope of this this amendment
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I have just a just a
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
follow up on some of the the points that
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
you've made yes sir um
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think I was aware that only that
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
we need a quorum of just 13 Senators to
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
participate so it would be possible
 
00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:45.620 align:start position:0%
if if they are concerned about having
 
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
two days
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
consecutively it is possible that they
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
could alternate and some group come one
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
year some come another year if they
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to right is that right so for for
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
the the purposes of a joint convention
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
we resolve ourselves both bodies into
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
meeting together in joint conventions so
 
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:07.740 align:start position:0%
the the house adopts a resolution the
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
Senate adopts a resolution as well uh in
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
order to adopt a simple resolution uh
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
for those purposes only requires a
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
quorum to do so uh so that that uh you
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
know how they chose to to do it is is
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
entirely up to them if if the 24 uh
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to be in for the purposes of the
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
initial I would I would just state that
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
convening day joint convention
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
is a very simple one it goes very
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
quickly it consists of the house
 
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
resolving into the joint convention the
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
Senate resolving into joint convention
 
00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:45.539 align:start position:0%
we exchanged messages we introduced the
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
Senate we hear the report from the
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State we form the committee
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
and we exit The Joint convention it's
 
00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:53.990 align:start position:0%
and we exit The Joint convention it's
usually

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
I think frankly it might take longer
 
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
introducing and getting the senator
 
00:28:00.769 --> 00:28:00.779 align:start position:0%
seated than the the actual uh report of
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
numbers by the Secretary of State then
 
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
the following day when we go into joint
 
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.510 align:start position:0%
the following day when we go into joint
convention

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
convention
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
um we come in to the Joint convention uh
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
we we review the report of the committee
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
and then we go into the actual uh
 
00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
inauguration but again similar to the
 
00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:19.850 align:start position:0%
inauguration but again similar to the
house

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
not all Senators attend on the
 
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:27.299 align:start position:0%
inauguration it uh this this year Alone
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
um you know many many many members of
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
the House did not attend uh the
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
inauguration this year um
 
00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:39.059 align:start position:0%
we we often as I mentioned do give up
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
extensive amounts of seating on the
 
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
floor to accommodate the the department
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
heads and and family and guests of the
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
governor-elect uh it is a courtesy
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
um and that is why we also opt not to
 
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
take other actions that day so that
 
00:28:57.289 --> 00:28:57.299 align:start position:0%
requiring members to be there is not
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
you know a true function in in that
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
sense we don't we don't hold votes to to
 
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
count against folks so
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
but we could
 
00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:09.409 align:start position:0%
but we could
um

00:29:09.409 --> 00:29:09.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
given that there's a need for some
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
Senators on on the first day and some
 
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
Senators on the second day
 
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:22.980 align:start position:0%
it is possible for them
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
on their own break into two different
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
groups and one attend one day and one to
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
ten this second day there's no there's
 
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
no requirement that the same Senator
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
that attends on the first day also
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
attend on the second day there's nothing
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
like that in here I I will I will I
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
would never I would never ever dare
 
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
question the the rules and and decision
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
making of the other body I understand
 
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying from a practical
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
purpose it is it is entirely within
 
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.130 align:start position:0%
purpose it is it is entirely within
their

00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
purview to be able to accommodate
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
the Senators who may not wish to drive
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
both days or come here both days it is
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
possible within this current situation
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
for them to just handle one day or the
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
other and as I said Mr chairman just to
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
be clear we could right now
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
we could right now
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
inaugurate the governor on convening day
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
there is no prohibition against that
 
00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:26.830 align:start position:0%
there is no prohibition against that
okay

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
for your explanations I'm still trying
 
00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:33.230 align:start position:0%
for your explanations I'm still trying
to

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
see the real problem here
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
um logistically this could be a
 
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
nightmare couldn't it because I'm I I
 
00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:42.539 align:start position:0%
was at the last inauguration has it been
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
at the others you're right a lot of
 
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
house members did not attend but usually
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of people come in for the
 
00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059 align:start position:0%
Governor's Inauguration so if we had
 
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
this all on the same day the way this
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
bill is suggesting the cacr rather
 
00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
um this could be logistically very
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
awkward for seating couldn't it well
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
again we so if this were to happen
 
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
during a regular session day uh we would
 
00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
not afford the governor uh the space on
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
certainly on the floor because we would
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
then go into a regular session
 
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
thereafter to do our work
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and and as I said uh over the the
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
last many years we have spent hours on
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
convening day arguing rules changes
 
00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we have a few is I don't
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
know half a dozen amendments to rules
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
but sometimes we have
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
20. so it it can take a while and I
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
obviously I note
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
um you know in the unfortunate
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh during covid on January
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
6 2021 uh when we were at the parking
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
lot session at UNH we also had to elect
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
a new speaker that day
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
um so I mean that it is a it is a day of
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman yeah um it may or
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
may not be relevant to this but um how
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
do other states do it does that matter
 
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
to any of this or what are the practices
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
I it doesn't matter I I well that's
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
that's it for you to determine uh if it
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
matters or not
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
um I can only speak to our perspective
 
00:32:26.409 --> 00:32:26.419 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um
 
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
so if we were to pass this
 
00:32:33.409 --> 00:32:33.419 align:start position:0%
what impact might this have on the work
 
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to do that day
 
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:37.700 align:start position:0%
would it
 
00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:40.700 align:start position:0%
complicate things would it make our work
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
longer I'm trying to again grasp the
 
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
problem sure well I I mean certainly as
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
as you folks are all expertly aware
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
um the the house will do the work that
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
it needs to do uh as long as it needs to
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
be done
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest uh that in in the
 
00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.090 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest uh that in in the
situation

00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
um there is no obligation to provide the
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
governor the opportunity to have an
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
inaugural address in the chamber it
 
00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:10.100 align:start position:0%
simply requires the governor to be sworn
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
in front of both houses and that's what
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
the uh the Constitution currently says
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
so that's why
 
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I I do think logistically
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
for for the house it would be a longer
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
more difficult day and
 
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know especially because as as you
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
are aware as well uh we usually convene
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's sort of an interesting time to
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
accommodate a certain time frame where
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
certain things are broadcast on certain
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
news networks
 
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
um and and that that usually plays into
 
00:33:50.889 --> 00:33:50.899 align:start position:0%
the timing of the inauguration as well
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
so you know in in reality what would
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
likely happen if we were sharing a day
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
we would come in do a little bit of work
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
then Sort of hope that work was done at
 
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:06.740 align:start position:0%
an exact time so that we can recess and
 
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
you know accommodate the the other
 
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.270 align:start position:0%
you know accommodate the the other
things

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
Senator McCarter
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.669 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.250 align:start position:0%
um
Clerk

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
Clerk
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
do you have any kind of a an attendance
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
record for
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
our convening day
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
as compared to inauguration day you may
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
not have it handy but is that something
 
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:34.740 align:start position:0%
easily accessible
 
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the the journals of
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
um on at the beginning of each Journal
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
because the journal is a reflection of
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
what happens on the floor so people call
 
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.649 align:start position:0%
what happens on the floor so people call
out

00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
for the day they are listed under the
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
excused absences part of the journal
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning and on convening
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
day you will see that because it is a an
 
00:34:58.630 --> 00:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
actual session day there are a lot less
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
historically than on inauguration day
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
and then again even on inauguration day
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
if people call
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
and tell me they're not coming they'll
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
be listed but that doesn't mean that
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
everybody calls so you know
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
so let's uh explore it this way let's
 
00:35:23.329 --> 00:35:23.339 align:start position:0%
say that we had all of this happen on
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
the same day and convening day
 
00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
obviously most people show up not all
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
but most
 
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
then the governor would be precluded
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
from having a lot of people there
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
supporting him or her or uh just I don't
 
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
know observing it would be it would
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
cause a logistical issue in your opinion
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
well for as I mentioned it is a courtesy
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
of the house that we afford seating on
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
the floor for the Governor's family
 
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
important dignitaries and department and
 
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
agency heads and then Gallery space as
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
well if this is going to happen during
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
an actual session day we would not
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
afford any floor space and frankly the
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
gallery would become kind of first come
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
first serve
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
it's a courtesy
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
um you know it
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
we we we do try to
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
um even though the legislation
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
legislative branch is the first Branch
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the Constitution and the
 
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.430 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the Constitution and the
best

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
um the governor is a is a co-equal
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
partner in government as is the court
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney I did want to
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
just address your question um I did
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
receive a text message from our our
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
legal counsel
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
um that uh
 
00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
regarding your question uh it is
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language that that specific
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
section because right now it does direct
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
the towns to put it on the ballot not
 
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
not a special meeting but it does the
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution does require the towns to
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
on the ballots announce uh what the
 
00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
elections are that's that's just a quick
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
text message that I received I don't
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
have any more details than that
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't think we had anything to
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
do with the ballot I mean they all come
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
from here to us we don't print them
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
ourselves so okay thank you of course
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you Mr
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
Claire for taking a question I just want
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
to put this to bed in my head so the the
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
language the the sponsor said was that
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
we can meet Wednesday
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't preclude us from meeting
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday but in my head what I I
 
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
don't show up for the uh the governor so
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
no I I've never done that I I give my
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
seat up I let someone else have my seat
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
I don't show up I show up on the day
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
that I need to and then the governor has
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
his day
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
but I sort of envisioned we would need
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
to show up both days to be able to give
 
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
the governor his time
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
and also to give us time to do our
 
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
business because I can't imagine that we
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
would just say to the governor like
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
go scratch you know what I mean so we
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
would we would give him time as a
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
courtesy but also we would need time to
 
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
do our business so I'm envisioning that
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
I would actually have to show up both
 
00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:16.970 align:start position:0%
I would actually have to show up both
days

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
and so in in on a Wednesday and a
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
Thursday and then in that point you know
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
for the convenience of the 24 Senators
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's like a severe inconvenience for the
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
400 legislators to show up
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
um whereas you know I'm only showing up
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
on one day currently
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I can't I I guess the question is can
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
you envision us having to both show up
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
on both days
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
um as the as a as a body to to
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
accommodate and then and therefore
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
instead of me giving up my seat I have
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
to be there both days
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
so I guess the answer to that question
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
um in my in my opinion
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard for me to Envision coming
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
early coming in earlier than convening
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
day because the whole notion of
 
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:05.900 align:start position:0%
convening means that we're starting
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
organization means we organize convening
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
means we're convening in beginning so to
 
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
to come in before that seems um
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
a I I'm fairly certain that that has
 
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140 align:start position:0%
never happened that we've come in that
 
00:39:24.609 --> 00:39:24.619 align:start position:0%
first Tuesday in January
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
because the Constitution since 1784 is
 
00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
the first Wednesday after the first
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
Tuesday in January so I don't think that
 
00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
we've ever come in well I shouldn't say
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
it it's been that way since 1784 because
 
00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:38.339 align:start position:0%
we used to meet in June so
 
00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
um but that being said it I
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
I would struggle to to think that we
 
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
would cut come in before actual
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
convening day
 
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.569 align:start position:0%
convening day
um

00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
just just for a reminder's sake um
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
what what day are we doing the Secretary
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
of State and treasurer that by the
 
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
Constitution is on organization
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
organization day so constitutionally on
 
00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
organization day the new house
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
assembles Alexis officers we go into
 
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
join convention to elect the Secretary
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
of State and State Treasurer and then we
 
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.870 align:start position:0%
of State and State Treasurer and then we
go

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
out of session we and we adjourn from
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
that session
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
you couldn't Envision or we've never had
 
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.230 align:start position:0%
you couldn't Envision or we've never had
three

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
convening days
 
00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:29.750 align:start position:0%
convening days
um

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
or three days during that time period
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
where we weren't able to handle the
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
amendments to our rules or anything like
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
that was it
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
this is again I I don't I don't want to
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
speak to Senate practice but as I
 
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:46.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned and they will acknowledge they
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
don't change their rules as regularly as
 
00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:51.619 align:start position:0%
we do we actually have a Rules meeting
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
later in December a full full-on Rules
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
meeting where any member brings their
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
amendments uh it's time for uh testimony
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
to come Etc so
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
on top of that is
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
the selections of of seating and parking
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
and committee assignments and and I just
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
to to have a session during that time
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
um is very unlikely uh especially as
 
00:41:20.569 --> 00:41:20.579 align:start position:0%
we're administratively trying to set up
 
00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%

00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
a positive vote on Senate bill 28. I'll
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you Senator did
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
I hear that you there already is this
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
portrait or this would be we're just
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
we're um they we can accept funds for
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
portrait to be done
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
I believe correct
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
well we'll find out
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the senator
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
I see one representative Tierney
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question senator
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
is this required for the historical
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
commission to accept anything do we have
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
to do this every single time something
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better if we just gave
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
them permission
 
00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:33.230 align:start position:0%
them permission
to

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
accept donations
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:41.339 align:start position:0%
versus having to come through with a
 
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
separate bill anytime somebody wishes to
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
make a donation
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
that would be another bill that we could
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
put in to allow allow the organization
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
to accept donations but for the time
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
being this is the
 
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
procedure we have okay thank you
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%

with you this morning
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
um just a few statements and then happy
 
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you might have
 
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
as you stated I am the executive
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire commission
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
for human rights I am also currently the
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
chair of the governor's advisory Council
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
just a few words about Rogers as Senator
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
Birdsall stated he was definitely a
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
friend to all people were not allowed to
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
be strangers around him and he made sure
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
to help anyone that would reach out to
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
him on any topic and if he didn't have
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
the answer he always knew who to point
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
you in the direction of so that you
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
could get said information but it was
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
rare that he didn't already have an
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
answer the
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
the part that's also important Rogers
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
was a commissioner for the Human Rights
 
00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
Commission he served as a commissioner
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
from 2003 to 2008 and from 2003 to 2005
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
he was the interim chair for the
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
commission and um and as Senator
 
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
Birdsall stated
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
Rogers was the first chair of the
 
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:56.060 align:start position:0%
diversity and inclusion Council in 2017
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
when it was created by executive order
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
by governor sununu and he remained the
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
chair until his passing in 2020.
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
um although I am excited to be the chair
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
of the council I am also sad that I'm
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
the chair of the council because that
 
00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
means he's not here to be the chair of
 
00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
the council and someone that I can reach
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
out to to ask whatever kind of question
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
about anything from how bills become a
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
law or I don't understand this
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
conference of committee committee of
 
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:29.900 align:start position:0%
conference can you explain that please
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
from those questions to anything
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
happening in the world today
 
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.650 align:start position:0%
happening in the world today
um

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
so it is a heavy heart a bit of cold
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
comfort to potentially have a portrait
 
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.099 align:start position:0%
of him here at the state house but also
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
a way to be able to pass by and and just
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
kind of wave and his wife was Poppy
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
Johnson she was uh very helpful in
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
kicking this off when the legislative
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
session started and I believe she's
 
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
watching via YouTube this morning so
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
good morning poppy
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh and their and their children
 
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
um Jay and Jeremy I know at least one of
 
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
them is possibly streaming with her at
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
home as well so
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
um she would have loved to have been
 
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
here but the travel and it it's it's
 
00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
hard right she's lost the love of her
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
life and although we've lost a friend
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
but the the family has lost
 
00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
significantly more I think the relevance
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
of having his portrait in the State
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
House speaks volumes it we already know
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
about based on what Senator broad so
 
00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:37.700 align:start position:0%
read the amount of of uh Public Service
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
Human Service that Rogers did over the
 
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
course of his life and that's I'm sure
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
just a mere scratching of the surface
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know every phone call every hello
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
every pet on the shoulder every kind
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
word those things are not listed in a
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
bio or an obituary but it's carried in
 
00:51:00.049 --> 00:51:00.059 align:start position:0%
the hearts of the people that he knew
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
and those people who knew others who
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
shared those stories so he is a a little
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
actually a big rock in our little Pond
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but he made a mighty
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
wave and spread across a wide girth of
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm excited to be here to share this
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
information with you and at this point
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
I'll close my statements and I'm happy
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%

00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%

um I may have it here I believe
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 2006 he was in the

house I do not remember the exact length
 
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:27.780 align:start position:0%

no it was in 2006 because he was asked
 
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.390 align:start position:0%
no it was in 2006 because he was asked

I was halfway there 2001 to 2006. before
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
about health matters yes so we we think
 
00:52:59.210 --> 00:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
HHS thank you
 
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
Community thought I appreciate that
 
00:53:04.809 --> 00:53:04.819 align:start position:0%

00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
um do we have
 
00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
further questions not seeing none thank
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
you very much I'm sorry just a moment if
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
I could there was a question that you
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
asked representative Tierney regarding
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
the accepting um of a donation and the
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
the legislation needed to be provided to
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
receive permission to hang the portrait
 
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
at the state house so we can't we could
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
go the com the diversity and inclusion
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
council could raise money and have a
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
beautiful portrait done but without
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
permission from the legislators to hang
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
the portrait and in the state house we
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
would not be able to do that so that's
 
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
part of what this process is
 
00:53:49.329 --> 00:53:49.339 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're welcome
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
is there a timeline that
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
that we know of the length of time
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
before this portrait would be available
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
um no not as of yet we are looking uh at
 
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
different artists to be able to to
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
create the portraiture uh but even prior
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
to that there needs to be a fundraising
 
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
campaign but the decision was made by
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
the group at the diversity and inclusion
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
Council not to begin raising funds until
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
we had permission to to chicken array
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
thing here so no cart before the horse I
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
like that better
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%

it is 10 15.
 
01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.550 align:start position:0%

um

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open up the hearing on
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 84.
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor of this bill
 
01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:10.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't look to be here but so I will
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay all right Senator gray uh welcome
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
my name is James Gray I represent Senate
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
District Six which starts up in Alton
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
and gilmington and goes down Route 11 to
 
01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739 align:start position:0%
um the reason that I'm here is I
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
hijacked this bill
 
01:19:39.719 --> 01:19:41.209 align:start position:0%
hijacked this bill
okay

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:41.219 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
up pure and simple
 
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
I had a a need that I needed to take
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
care of
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
um and that was how we were doing
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions that was
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
stuck into I believe it's house bill 2.
 
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
which started restricting the number of
 
01:20:00.189 --> 01:20:00.199 align:start position:0%
people that we could put on there
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
how many could be on a committee or
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
commission and as we started to write
 
01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:08.420 align:start position:0%
bills this year
 
01:20:10.850 --> 01:20:10.860 align:start position:0%
and set up those committees in
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
commission it was Bill after Bill after
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
Bill that people said I just can't live
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
so the original bill here
 
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:21.729 align:start position:0%
so the original bill here
um

01:20:21.729 --> 01:20:21.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
and had to do with uh
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
um assessing and
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
payments in lieu of taxes Etc and I
 
01:20:35.149 --> 01:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
spoke with the prime sponsor she was
 
01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
going to put a committee onto that bill
 
01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
and I said well I want to at least add
 
01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.070 align:start position:0%
and I said well I want to at least add
this

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
and it just ended up that it was easier
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
because we have already had that bill
 
01:20:50.689 --> 01:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
come before both the house decision was
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
made to go just with the bill
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
this goes back quite a bit on the to the
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
language that we had prior to the change
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
um diff the difference between a
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
committee and the commission you can see
 
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
in the bill that's probably not what
 
01:21:09.169 --> 01:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
your friends have told you all along
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
that you know if you want people outside
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
of the it has to be a commission and if
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
you don't have people outside it's going
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
to be a committee well that's
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
kind of right kind of wrong you can see
 
01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill again
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they tried to
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
accomplish in that is that there would
 
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
always be a majority of legislature this
 
01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.350 align:start position:0%
always be a majority of legislature this
legislative

01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
Representatives on these committees and
 
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.470 align:start position:0%
Representatives on these committees and
commissions

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
and if you're only limited to 15 people
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
that means that eight of them if you're
 
01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:50.699 align:start position:0%
going to have 15 have to be a
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
legislature from the legislature uh
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
Senate doesn't want to have that many
 
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
people on there uh so we were limiting
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
us to one which would mean that that
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
have to be six house members at least
 
01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:05.410 align:start position:0%
have to be six house members at least
okay

01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:05.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
a lot of the people I spoke to in the
 
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
house said hey I'm already stretching it
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
to get here two three days a week
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
um you know the more committees
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
commissions you put me on the harder it
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
is for me to serve
 
01:22:22.250 --> 01:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh so with all that said that's why you
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
have the bill as amended in front of you
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
we think it's a reasonable approach
 
01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.209 align:start position:0%
we think it's a reasonable approach
um

01:22:29.209 --> 01:22:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to answer any questions
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:39.860 align:start position:0%
somehow I got
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
dumped the clerk of the house is here
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I hope he speaks in favor of it but
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
he and I haven't spoken on this bill so
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.870 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%

committee for commissions and committees
 
01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
um there have been other committees for
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees over the
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
years and a lot of work has been done to
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
try to modify this can you please the
 
01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
practice that is of establishing these
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me in the Senate
 
01:23:23.159 --> 01:23:24.050 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me in the Senate
um

01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%

01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
Direction given to Senators say with an
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
orientation process or anything as to
 
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
the number of commissions and committees
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
um we don't do that kind of thing in the
 
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.689 align:start position:0%
um we don't do that kind of thing in the
Senate

01:23:43.689 --> 01:23:43.699 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:46.820 align:start position:0%
certainly it gets to be
 
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
self-restricting if you go on and look
 
01:23:54.729 --> 01:23:54.739 align:start position:0%
at statutory committees for the Senators
 
01:23:58.490 --> 01:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
those of us that are able to take on
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
that work have many many okay I'm on the
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
skyhaven airport Advisory Board I'm the
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
senate representative to the university
 
01:24:11.450 --> 01:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
system I'm on the uh Professional
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
Engineers whatever whatever I'm on
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government Finance
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
I'm on and the list goes on
 
01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
so that is is why when there is
 
01:24:28.970 --> 01:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
when your name goes on a bill and it has
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
a commission in it
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
um odds are the higher your name is on
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
that bill the more likely the Senate
 
01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
President is going to say oh Jim
 
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
volunteered for this and so you know we
 
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
do try to limit them but there's a lot
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
of things that we just can't do in one
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
year there's a lot of things that when
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
you put them on
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
a retained bill that they just don't get
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
the number of people that you need or
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
the type of people you need and you need
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
to have people from other things so you
 
01:25:04.689 --> 01:25:04.699 align:start position:0%
need to to have it to be a commission
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
again that's you know there is no no
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
restriction nothing in the training that
 
01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
I received all those many years ago I
 
01:25:15.890 --> 01:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
think it was four it must be seven years
 
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
since you and I served in the house
 
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair hello Senator gray
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh all right so is this bill
 
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
um we'll put it in layman's terms I'm a
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
freshman so I'm trying to read through
 
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
this and make sure I understand it
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
correctly the public is watching as well
 
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
on YouTube presumably are you suggesting
 
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
or or the the uh the sponsor of this
 
01:25:44.219 --> 01:25:45.410 align:start position:0%
or or the the uh the sponsor of this
bill

01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:47.930 --> 01:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
um what I'm gathering from this language
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
and maybe you can clarify this is
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
suggesting that people can be appointed
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
to these committees or commissions that
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
are not legislature sure
 
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
many subject matter experts uh lobbyists
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
any of those sorts of people that have
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
an interest in whatever the committee
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
serves yes yeah okay and the current
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislation would limit the whole thing
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
to 15 people
 
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
and it also says that it has to be a
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
majority of legislature legislators on
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
there okay which would limit the you
 
01:26:30.890 --> 01:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
know what you can have
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
um take the solid waste working group
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh how many legislators you know
 
01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
are really up on the you know citing
 
01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
requirements for landfills how many you
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
know know the the you know how easy it
 
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:49.800 align:start position:0%
is to make methane from food waste how
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
many know that there's uh
 
01:26:54.169 --> 01:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
um you know all of the clothing and
 
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
different textiles that are put into the
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
land waste and and how they have to be
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
done how many know you know what the
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
price for recyclables both glass and
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
plastic are I mean you need experts to
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
do that and you need in in solid waste
 
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
working group you need a lot of experts
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay because there's a lot of different
 
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
things out there and what we were doing
 
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
in the Senate as you were saying
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding and going into the thing
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
this revision this is what it's going to
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
be that was just a waste of my time
 
01:27:29.639 --> 01:27:31.270 align:start position:0%
be that was just a waste of my time
follow-up

01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
so how would you imagine that these uh
 
01:27:38.510 --> 01:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
appointees would be vetted
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
um to eliminate any sort of bias to kind
 
01:27:43.850 --> 01:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
of steer these committees towards a
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
certain outcome like how how would you
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
um how would you imagine that well
 
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
and the way you do it is that in the
 
01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
bill that sets up the commission or
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
committee you tell them who is going to
 
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
appoint them and certainly my opinion is
 
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
you want bias on both sides you want
 
01:28:07.129 --> 01:28:07.139 align:start position:0%
people who are for this and you want
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
people that are against it so you know
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
you may have the Realtors and you may
 
01:28:13.729 --> 01:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
have the contractors and you may have
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know people from the housing
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
authority and you may have you know
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
people from other walks of life so you
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
want them to be able to represent their
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
constituency okay and that's how when
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
you craft the bill that has a committee
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
in it you say
 
01:28:32.639 --> 01:28:33.410 align:start position:0%
in it you say
um

01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know the nursing association will
 
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
appoint okay the uh whatever you know
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
and you pick the group that needs to be
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
represented in there and
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
public members
 
01:28:48.649 --> 01:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and Council
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know is often a thing that's in
 
01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
those things uh there's a whole bunch of
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
things that you do and if you've got one
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
of those bills
 
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
if you don't get it right in the
 
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
drafting then all those lobbyists will
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
come tell you I need to be on that
 
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
committee commission I need my group
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
needs to be represented
 
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
Senator I have a question um when you
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
started your testimony
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
um you said that you hijacked the bill
 
01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:23.219 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering
 
01:29:23.219 --> 01:29:23.930 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering
um

01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
has the language in this bill that's
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:32.689 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
hasn't had a public hearing
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
I don't remember whether I held the
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing or not but since the bill
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
was going to have a committee or
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
Commission in it and it was in my
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee I ruled it Jermain because it
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
was dealing with how that committee or
 
01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:51.620 align:start position:0%
commission would be
 
01:29:56.209 --> 01:29:56.219 align:start position:0%
put forward but the nice thing is you're
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
having a hearing right now
 
01:29:58.199 --> 01:30:00.169 align:start position:0%
having a hearing right now
and

01:30:00.169 --> 01:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
not a whole lot of attendance because
 
01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:05.219 align:start position:0%
because these people from uh you know
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
are probably not going to testify and
 
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
I think the only other one you probably
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
got on your list is is sitting to my
 
01:30:13.850 --> 01:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
right absolutely
 
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.750 align:start position:0%
right absolutely
um

01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
I had another question
 
01:30:18.649 --> 01:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
um as representative wall mentioned
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
there is a special committee on
 
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
commissions that the speaker set up and
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
um on page one of this bill line 789 it
 
01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:30.260 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:34.520 align:start position:0%
study committees being repealed ending
 
01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
at the filing period or on November 1st
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
are any of these special committees
 
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
commissions that we're going to be
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
studying and looking at to repeal are
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
any of these that you're talking about
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
in your bill
 
01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
in here that we're going to be looking
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
at again this is most of that language
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
that you're reading there is returned to
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
what it used to be before uh two years
 
01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
ago okay okay uh so uh you know we don't
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
want these committees and commissions
 
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
you know lasting forever uh so we do
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
want them to expire or that the
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
legislature takes action to make sure
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they go beyond I think you look at
 
01:31:20.330 --> 01:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
their the Committees expire and the
 
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
commissions can you know go on beyond
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
that but again you would go back to the
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
legislation that created it to see
 
01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
what's uh what the situation
 
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:31:35.209 --> 01:31:35.219 align:start position:0%
and I have just one more question
 
01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
um the last page of the bill line nine
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
and ten
 
01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:41.689 align:start position:0%
and ten
um

01:31:41.689 --> 01:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
all commissions shall be
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate executive branch agency as
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
determined by the general court
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
um is there danger in giving these
 
01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
agencies more Authority than they need
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
that is actually in there the way I
 
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
understand it because that was stuck in
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
there from one of the AIDS over in the
 
01:32:08.050 --> 01:32:08.060 align:start position:0%
Senate is that the house no longer
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
hosts those committees and commissions
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
here in the state house because of room
 
01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:15.970 align:start position:0%
here in the state house because of room
availability

01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:15.980 align:start position:0%
availability
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
and other issues so that most of these
 
01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
are hosted at one of the department
 
01:32:27.050 --> 01:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
level you know organizations
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste working group is held over
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
on Hazen Drive the assessing Standards
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
Board which I also sit on is held over
 
01:32:38.350 --> 01:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
in the hug Allen Park
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:32:42.890 --> 01:32:42.900 align:start position:0%
you don't want to provide the
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
administrative services and so if you
 
01:32:47.450 --> 01:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
attach it to one of the Departments out
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
there and they support it then they'll
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
fight for it and they'll provide the you
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
know copying the emailing the all kinds
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
of things that you don't want to do
 
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other oh yes uh rep
 
01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:03.530 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other oh yes uh rep
constable

01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
constable
 
01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
01:33:07.250 --> 01:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Senator
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
um on the first page line 10 you have
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
the establishment of the study committee
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
and so you don't have the majority being
 
01:33:16.729 --> 01:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have anything about a
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
majority but it says shall not exceed 15
 
01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.330 align:start position:0%
majority but it says shall not exceed 15
members

01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
um it still says shall be limited to
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
members of the general court only
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
so are we saying there's no minimum to
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
the to kick is there one person going to
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
be appointed to the Committees there's
 
01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:34.139 align:start position:0%
no minimum yeah you're going to be one
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
of the ones who decides that when you
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
pass the Bill uh this I left in there on
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
a committee because you don't have the
 
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:46.139 align:start position:0%
people from other you know departments
 
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
Etc so I left that in there to to give
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
you something that was in the House Bill
 
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
2 kind of thing uh and I don't know if
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
you've you know when you have a a the
 
01:34:01.490 --> 01:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
whole committee here probably 20 members
 
01:34:04.729 --> 01:34:04.739 align:start position:0%
20 20 or 21.
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
um it makes it sometimes more difficult
 
01:34:07.850 --> 01:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
to get things done
 
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
and so I think that was probably why
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
that was put into that version of the
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
bill that we're living under now and so
 
01:34:20.450 --> 01:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
I left that 15 in there for the
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
Committees not the commissions uh to do
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
that and you go down below in lines 21
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
and Below uh that talks about the
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
commissions and you you I don't believe
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
that I left in there anything about the
 
01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.290 align:start position:0%
that I left in there anything about the
15.

01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
15.
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
for the commissions yeah okay thank you
 
01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.930 align:start position:0%
for the commissions yeah okay thank you
representative

01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:40.940 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Senator again
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm going back to what Chairman's
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
raised on page two Linens 10 and 9 and
 
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
10 rather all commissions shall be
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate executive branch agency
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's the Departments and agencies over
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
which we have what we have over 100 of
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
those here in the state
 
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
um who has Authority then over the
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions rather
 
01:35:11.209 --> 01:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
I mean who would be in charge are they
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
are they the ones who will then
 
01:35:14.689 --> 01:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
administratively be scheduling the
 
01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
earrings and all how how do you expect
 
01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
this to work well let's take
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
um you know either assessing standards
 
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
or we'll take uh Solid Waste program
 
01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:27.770 align:start position:0%
or we'll take uh Solid Waste program
group

01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
um you know the department supplies the
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
facility where we meet at the department
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
supplies the administrative Health
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
um the Committees and commissions I
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
should say the commissions uh generally
 
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
elect their own chair and the chair you
 
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
know and the members of the commission
 
01:35:51.410 --> 01:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
are the ones who usually pick the dates
 
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
for the meetings again that has to be
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
tempered with the availability of the
 
01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:58.950 align:start position:0%
space in
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:01.070 align:start position:0%
space in
[Music]

01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.290 align:start position:0%
[Music]
the

01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:02.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services they have a
 
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:07.139 align:start position:0%
couple of classrooms that they use for
 
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
various things and over at DES uh excuse
 
01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.179 align:start position:0%
me over at uh for the assessing
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
Standards Board
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
um you know they have one great big
 
01:36:21.290 --> 01:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
classroom and sometimes that's hard to
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
get so it's it's a cooperation and again
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
if if you don't have a department that
 
01:36:30.169 --> 01:36:30.179 align:start position:0%
is supporting what you're doing for
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
commission either wanting to make it go
 
01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:35.900 align:start position:0%
or wanting to make it die
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
then why did you have one in the first
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
place I mean
 
01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:42.169 align:start position:0%
place I mean
so

01:36:42.169 --> 01:36:42.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
but right now because we no longer host
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
them here uh in the State House you got
 
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
to host them somewhere and you don't
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
have any money to pay for anything uh
 
01:36:56.330 --> 01:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
who's got the money to pay for a spot
 
01:37:01.129 --> 01:37:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Senator all right
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
of things
 
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
this change that was done last year was
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
actually in front of this committee as a
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
standalone bill it was not hijacked into
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
any House Bill 2 or anything of the sort
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1269 came to this committee
 
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh this committee uh worked on the issue
 
01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:52.860 align:start position:0%
it had two subcommittee work sessions
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
and was then passed unanimously on the
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
consent calendar it was sent over to the
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
Senate where it was referred to Edna and
 
01:38:01.810 --> 01:38:01.820 align:start position:0%
passed on their consent calendar
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
and was put into law last year and it
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
was effective as of September so this
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill is this language is new but it was
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
done by this committee and for several
 
01:38:13.679 --> 01:38:14.990 align:start position:0%
done by this committee and for several
reasons

01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
um one of which uh well before before we
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
get into that
 
01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.570 align:start position:0%
get into that
um

01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from us is that you
 
01:38:24.770 --> 01:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
retain this bill for the short term and
 
01:38:26.689 --> 01:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
the reason is because we have the
 
01:38:28.129 --> 01:38:28.139 align:start position:0%
speaker has established a special
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee to examine commissions and
 
01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
committees and we have to clarify uh
 
01:38:36.169 --> 01:38:36.179 align:start position:0%
because of questions that have come up
 
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
represented possible specifically the
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
difference between a committee and a
 
01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
commission we have statutory committees
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then we have commissions which are a
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
separate thing entirely a study
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
committee that has been capped at 15
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
members in this legislation which is is
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
extremely unusual because study
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
committees are legislative studies done
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
by members of both bodies period and
 
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
historically those have consisted of not
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
more than five people and getting those
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
five people is sometimes a task so
 
01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
upping that to 15 is going to be nigh
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
impossible so that is that is something
 
01:39:18.410 --> 01:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
for consideration in terms of
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
the specific questions about commissions
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
and who they were who was appointing
 
01:39:25.370 --> 01:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
them and and representative McCarter you
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
asked about uh who's driving the policy
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
when commissions commissions have gotten
 
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
out of hand and one of the the big
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
um reasons for the the the legislation
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year was because we
 
01:39:44.209 --> 01:39:44.219 align:start position:0%
were in possession of two committees
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
with commissions with 40 plus persons on
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
them that's insane
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is you're dealing
 
01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
with Quorum issues more of the time than
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
you are with actually policy discussion
 
01:40:00.649 --> 01:40:00.659 align:start position:0%
and driving the issue so this whole
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
change wholesale change in the stat the
 
01:40:06.590 --> 01:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
chaptered and statutory committees and
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
commissions language last year in 1449
 
01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:12.620 align:start position:0%
was the result of several years of work
 
01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
that was done by folks like
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel who had been on the
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
last committee on committees uh that
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
that Jen I think has given you your
 
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
committee researcher has given you
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
information on
 
01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
and the reality is that the way that
 
01:40:32.209 --> 01:40:32.219 align:start position:0%
this language is crafted here in SB 84
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
it it does need some work but we're
 
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
suggesting that you retain it because
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
this special committee that has been
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
established is looking at the totality
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the chapter but also of all of the
 
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees as they
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
currently exist the commissions were
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
purposely set last term to be not more
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
than 15 with a majority of legislators
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
because the folks in its arguably the
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate at the time felt
 
01:41:04.850 --> 01:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
that the legislators should be the ones
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
driving the policy with input from the
 
01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
public or from other agencies or other
 
01:41:15.290 --> 01:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
various groups or lobbyists or of that
 
01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
sort so the fact that this Pat that this
 
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
language passed unanimously just last
 
01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
year by both bodies I I do think speaks
 
01:41:26.570 --> 01:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
to the intent that we were trying to get
 
01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
a hold on some of these growing issues
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
with committees and commissions and I'll
 
01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
let I'll let Jim answer some of those
 
01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:37.250 align:start position:0%
let I'll let Jim answer some of those
foreign

01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's important to sort of
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about committees and
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
commissions and then it got a bit
 
01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
confusing trying to differentiate
 
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
between them
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
um and really if you think about sort of
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
three types of categories and only one
 
01:41:52.010 --> 01:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
is really a problem and attempted to be
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
addressed last year and then also with
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
um Paul spoke about uh legislator only
 
01:41:58.490 --> 01:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
studies those are chaptered studies
 
01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
those are in the first section of RSA
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
1449 and also in the first section of
 
01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
this bill and as Paul said generally
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
those are only four or five members
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
usually for house one Senate
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
um though they're staffed by the
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
legislature legislator only they follow
 
01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
our house and Senate rules they're
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
really not an issue and so as Paul
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think trying to amend that
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
section of the current law by limiting
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
them to 15 members
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do any harm I just don't
 
01:42:30.229 --> 01:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary because they're I
 
01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
don't think I've ever seen a chapter
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's got more than four or five
 
01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.070 align:start position:0%
that's got more than four or five
members

01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
um the other type of statutory committee
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
um which doesn't really present an issue
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
are what are termed regulatory or
 
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
administrative committees or entities
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
um something like the fiscal committee
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
or a gel car or the Mount Washington
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
commission they are creatures of Statute
 
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
but they don't really study topics
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're really regulatory in nature they
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
have a built-in staff whether it's the
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
legislature LBA or administrative rules
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
or an outside agency which staffs them
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
because they really do take on a
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
regulatory function
 
01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:12.679 align:start position:0%
what what the 2022 legislation Hospital
 
01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
1269 and what this bill attempts to do
 
01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
is address all the other types of study
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
commissions which are a mix of
 
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
legislators and outside members those
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
currently exist they would exist under
 
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
this bill it's
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
but we really get at the membership and
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the governance of those types of
 
01:43:32.930 --> 01:43:32.940 align:start position:0%
commissions and really the issues are
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
because there's something of a hybrid
 
01:43:36.530 --> 01:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
the question is how are they
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
administered how are they governed
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
um some have an attachment to the
 
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
legislature particularly when they're
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
chaired by a legislator but when um when
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
the majority of the membership is
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
outside members or they're chaired by
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
outside members really the legislature
 
01:43:52.729 --> 01:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
kind of loses touch with them and so
 
01:43:55.970 --> 01:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
some are administered by agencies some
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
really aren't administered at all and I
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
think that is the intent of the section
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
I know there are some questions on page
 
01:44:04.729 --> 01:44:04.739 align:start position:0%
two about the administrative attachment
 
01:44:04.739 --> 01:44:05.390 align:start position:0%
two about the administrative attachment
um

01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
really what that gets at it's it's not
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily a philosophical concept of
 
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
of whether the legislature seeding their
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
Authority it's really about who's going
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
to administer these things and I think
 
01:44:18.649 --> 01:44:18.659 align:start position:0%
the intent is I can't really speak to
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
the intent but my impression is to the
 
01:44:23.689 --> 01:44:23.699 align:start position:0%
extent that these types of study
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
commissions are really out exist outside
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature even though they have
 
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
legislators on them they should be
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
administered by somebody outside the
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislature whether hosting the meeting
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
space or running the meetings or writing
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
the reports
 
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
um and and so I think that's an attempt
 
01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:42.229 align:start position:0%
um and and so I think that's an attempt
here

01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
um to sort of
 
01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
not that they're necessarily executive
 
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
branch entities but they do take on sort
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
of an executive function
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
um particularly when they get Beyond
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
sort of the scope of just studying a
 
01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:57.470 align:start position:0%
sort of the scope of just studying a
topic

01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't know if if that
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
would necessarily resolve all the
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
problems but I think it's an attempt to
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
sort of resolve those administrative and
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
governance issues and that's why it's
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
so so with that uh Madam chair members
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the Committees we are um as I said we
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
are sort of encouraging uh retaining
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we can work with you
 
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
all uh work with our partners on the
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
special committee uh to by the way that
 
01:45:25.129 --> 01:45:25.139 align:start position:0%
special committee
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
um it to members of this committee are
 
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
on that special committee uh the vice
 
01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
chair and and the ranking member are
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
both on that committee uh and we
 
01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:34.790 align:start position:0%
both on that committee uh and we
um

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:37.129 --> 01:45:37.139 align:start position:0%
we are happy to answer any questions and
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
work with you on this issue thank you
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions yes
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
rep costable
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you guys for taking the question
 
01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.090 align:start position:0%
thank you guys for taking the question
um

01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
so do you see retaining this as as sort
 
01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
of a placeholder for the commission or
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
why not just why not just in expedient
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
to legislate at this point so I I think
 
01:46:00.290 --> 01:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
that you know to the extent that there
 
01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
might be some discussions uh especially
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
with with folks from the special
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
committee about some of the some of the
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
portions contained in this bill uh that
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
keeping the vehicle alive uh certainly
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
um helps and and the collaboration
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
between this committee and the special
 
01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:15.350 align:start position:0%
between this committee and the special
committee

01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:17.219 align:start position:0%
um Can can address some of those issues
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know Jim brought up the point of
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
the administrative attachment again I
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
think uh and I understand there's been
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
some questions about that but again I
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
think that what you're what we need to
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
look at as as if this is a viable option
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
putting that in statutes so that I'll
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
give you an example right now we have
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
folks that that were put in charge of or
 
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
were named first as members of
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
commissions last year and um you know
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
the we don't host we couldn't host those
 
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
things we can't host those things we
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to do like we
 
01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:52.860 align:start position:0%
used to do and host a myriad of these
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
commissions and
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
um so this member uh was trying to call
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
around to various state agencies willing
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
to host uh his meeting and the fact of
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
the matter is if we're going to do that
 
01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:06.830 align:start position:0%
the matter is if we're going to do that
um

01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
get we it would be helpful if that
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
exists such that the way future
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
commissions are created that the
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
language would say this commission will
 
01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
be administratively attached to the
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:47:21.169 --> 01:47:21.179 align:start position:0%
that means that the department has to
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
provide meeting space
 
01:47:25.129 --> 01:47:25.139 align:start position:0%
and and a web presence and that sort of
 
01:47:27.649 --> 01:47:27.659 align:start position:0%
thing right now we list
 
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
on our internal stuff our websites and
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing we do list all of
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
the commissions and they're meeting
 
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
information as we receive them
 
01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know once that once we they sort of
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
meet in in elect and that sort of thing
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
uh unless we hear from them and and get
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
updates on meetings and that sort of
 
01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
thing it's
 
01:47:56.030 --> 01:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:47:58.910 --> 01:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
final question
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
um just on a philosophical sort of
 
01:48:01.679 --> 01:48:03.169 align:start position:0%
um just on a philosophical sort of
policy

01:48:03.169 --> 01:48:03.179 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
um opinion do you believe that keeping
 
01:48:09.169 --> 01:48:09.179 align:start position:0%
the majority of legislators as important
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
on commissions to make sure that the
 
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
sort of authority rests in in the
 
01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:17.219 align:start position:0%
legislature or are you open to
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
um you know getting rid of the the
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
majority rule there so I that's that's
 
01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
I don't want to opine on that um I I
 
01:48:27.530 --> 01:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
would simply say that that it was the
 
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
unanimous opinion of this committee last
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
term and uh of the house and its
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
adoption on the consent calendar that
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
um that that was the preferred way of
 
01:48:39.410 --> 01:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
handling legislation
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
um I I very much want to stress that uh
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
when when people think of of lobbyists
 
01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire these are not the kind
 
01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
of lobbyists that we think of uh in in
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
other places with you know cigar smoke
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
and Shady uh Shady dealings
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
um you know our lobbyists here in New
 
01:49:00.169 --> 01:49:00.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh have been have been here
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
for years and decades building
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
relationships and providing information
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
so there there is nothing to say that
 
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
this was a a slap in any lobbyist face
 
01:49:10.729 --> 01:49:10.739 align:start position:0%
or organizations face
 
01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
um but it it in reality it was the
 
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
determination by this Committee in the
 
01:49:18.169 --> 01:49:18.179 align:start position:0%
house that the legislators should be
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
making the the recommend the majority of
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the of the of the group should be
 
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.129 align:start position:0%
the of the of the group should be
legislators

01:49:25.129 --> 01:49:25.139 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
um receiving input and I would stress as
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
well that committees study committees
 
01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
can study the exact same issue
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
and take input and testimony from the
 
01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
exact same people that are at the table
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
as commissions
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:48.890 --> 01:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:50.330 align:start position:0%
seeing none
um

01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:53.209 --> 01:49:53.219 align:start position:0%
and I will close the hearing on Senate
 
01:50:13.209 --> 01:50:13.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman
 
01:50:18.890 --> 01:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
do you or the chairman himself see any
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
time in the near future when we might be
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
working on these or sucking on them do
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
we know
 
01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:34.460 align:start position:0%
