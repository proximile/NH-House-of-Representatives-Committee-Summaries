uh yes
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh this bill uh appropriates a hundred
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%

for their purchase of uh herbicides now
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the amendment
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill sets out the
 
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.629 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill sets out the
method

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
method
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and timing of such reimbursements
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
and the amendment also requires a
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
department to maintain
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
an active invasive species
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
remediation program
 
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
of mechanical
 
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.990 align:start position:0%
of mechanical
cultural

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
cultural
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
biological and chemical controls
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
to prevent the spread of invasive
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
species all right i think we're con
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
i think we're confusing the amendment
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the bill i think you're talking
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment says
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
we have a in
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
active upland invasive species program
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
subsidize the purchase of herbicides by
 
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.869 align:start position:0%
subsidize the purchase of herbicides by
municipality

00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment reduces the need to have
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
bulk purchases
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
because the department couldn't maintain
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
purchasing in bulk that's the primary
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
which would mean over 300 machines and
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
they would randomly pick
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
two machines out of all of those to run
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
it against the machines that did the
 
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.630 align:start position:0%
it against the machines that did the
calculations

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
calculations
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
during the voting night and
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
one of the requirements of the bill is
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
that they would have to be audited
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
within five days after the voting by the
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of these machines is
 
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
the cost of these machines is
approximately

00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
one hundred thousand dollars
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
so what we're having is a cost of a
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars to
 
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.430 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars to
check

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
the validity of two
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
balloting machines out of all this uh
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
machines in the state and um
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
having considered that that's such a low
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of all the machines utilized
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
and and in considering that the benefit
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
of that against the cost is de minimis
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
are actually none so um
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
with that with the cost the extra
 
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.590 align:start position:0%
with that with the cost the extra
um

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
work on the secretaries of state's
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
office at a very busy time in a very
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
crunch time for that office
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
the majority of the
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
division one considered this an
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate thank you madam
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh represent walt you
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
want to whilst you want to say something
 
00:18:45.919 --> 00:18:46.789 align:start position:0%
want to whilst you want to say something
um

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
the i just wanted to make clear that
 
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
this has to be done by noon on friday of
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
election week so it's not even quite a
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
full five days it's very fast and the uh
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office was
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
concerned that they didn't have the time
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
for a proper turnaround even if this was
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
something that the committee thought
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
that it was
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
a speed or
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
smart to do
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
and you know two machines out of over
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
300 there was a suggestion that it would
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
intimidate people from nefarious actions
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
but the chances of getting caught are
 
00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
less than one percent so i think it's
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
safe to say that this kind of minimal
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh audit would not
 
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
uh audit would not
uh

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
discourage anybody who had nefarious
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
approach to things so again i would
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
concur that i think this is a waste of a
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars it's not going
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
to do anything to secure our elections
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
or to even give people a sense of
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
security of our elections and so that's
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
why we opposed the purchase of this
 
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
why we opposed the purchase of this
machine

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative emerick
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.470 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's short-sighted to decide
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to buy a machine and
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
use it one time the intention here was
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
to set up a model for future auditing
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
and give it a trial run so to speak with
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
just a couple of
 
00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:01.750 align:start position:0%
just a couple of
districts

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
so it's it's yes the bill itself speaks
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
to just the next election
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
however the the process
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
would move forward if it's if it's
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
effective thank you madam chair
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative mooney
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
i am going to oppose the motion of itl
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i would encourage my colleagues to
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
do the same so that i can offer can be
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
offered and ought to pass motion
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
it can be challenging amidst different
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
opinions different controversy related
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
to election law to find common ground
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
and cooperation and agreement however
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
that was found in senate bill 366
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
it came out of election law 20 to 0.
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
it was passed by the full house on
 
00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
it was passed by the full house on
consent

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
it was brought to my attention earlier
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
today that we spend hundreds of dollars
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds thousands of dollars hundreds
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
of hours and so forth auditing state
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
police most recently or banks etc
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
why not endorse this very reasonably
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
priced way
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
to audit
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
elections making sure our counting
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
devices are working correctly
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
so with that i will oppose the motion i
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
would encourage my colleagues to do the
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
same and i would endorse not only the
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
cost of this very reasonable between
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
fifty and a hundred thousand to buy that
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
high speed speed scanner
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
and endorse what the election law the
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
full election law committee accomplished
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
earlier this year thank you madam chair
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you represent mooney are there
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.470 align:start position:0%
other comments
just

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure that
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
nobody else had their hand up okay
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
represent waltz um just to respond to
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to point out that the
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
election committee was deciding policy
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
it is not policy that's before this
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee it's whether it's the right
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
thing to do to spend a hundred thousand
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
dollars on these machines and the
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
question that we have before us is this
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
a wise use of money
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
i have said and i continue to believe it
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
is a waste of a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
it is not going to bring election
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
security or even a sense of election
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
security to anybody so i think that
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
while the election policy committee may
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
have supported this i think we have a
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
different job here and that job is to
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
look at the money and in looking at the
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
money i would suggest that this is not
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
an appropriate use of the money i would
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
also point out that this committee has
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
had bills like this in the past and we
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
have consistently turned it down finding
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
that these machines did not really serve
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
a purpose that supported us here in the
 
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.149 align:start position:0%
a purpose that supported us here in the
state

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further comments
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
representative hatch i just have one to
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
the thought that this is a test run so
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
maybe there's some credence to that but
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
my thoughts are if a manufacturer is
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
manufacturing a machine like this
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
they're really
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
are going to speak to the accuracy of it
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
and the worthiness of it and often i
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
found in business throughout my life
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
something at this costly they're more
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
than happy to illustrate its accuracy
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
and its worthiness without costing
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
the recipients or the buyer on any money
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
so again i just firmly believe i'm all
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
for um
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
faith in our election system i think we
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
have it there is no credible evidence
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
evidence anywhere that what we're doing

to my motion or would we are we
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
considering an amendment in just a
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
this bill the reason the committee went
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
for interim study is this bill is a
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
troubled bill
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
and it puts us in violation of a number
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
of things if we actually pass this bill
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
as it came for us recognizing that there
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
may be some concerns we thought we might
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
go to interim study and the first thing
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
we need to consider is the uniform and
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
overseas citizens absentee voting act
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
and that act says that we have to send
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
to military people their ballots 45 days
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
before the election and this applies not
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
just to the members of the military but
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
to anybody voting overseas us government
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
employees or american citizens living
 
00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:36.310 align:start position:0%
employees or american citizens living
overseas

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
the way this bill would work is you
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
could not certify the vote until 14 days
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
after the election
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
given the timing of our primary
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
it would not allow for certification in
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
time to meet that 45-day requirement to
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
send the ballots to any overseas voter
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
so it would immediately put us in
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
violation of
 
00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:02.950 align:start position:0%
violation of
uocaba

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
uocaba
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
it also would make it possible
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
for local election officials um
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
let me let me repeat my i'm repeating
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
myself here
 
00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:14.470 align:start position:0%
myself here
um

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
it would also put us in violation um or
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
a problem with the national voter
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
registration act which is because we are
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
subject to that because we have same-day
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
voter registration
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
and if we're in violation of that it's
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
going to really complicate all kinds of
 
00:30:34.149 --> 00:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
future registrations in this state and
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
we would all of a sudden have to set up
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
a whole new voter registration system
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with what we currently have
 
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
that would be expensive to say the least
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
finally we all have gotten a lot of
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
emails on this because what it does is
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
that violates voter addonimity um in
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
other words the secret ballot would no
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
longer exist for certain people um and
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
so that it would set up what's called
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots where ballots would
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
be marked and they would be able to
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
trace back to the actual voter
 
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.789 align:start position:0%
trace back to the actual voter
so

00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i want to say that we
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
oppose it because it
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i just want to say too i think every
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
veteran every member of the military
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
should be voting against this because
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
you're really disenfranchising our
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
military members who are outside the
 
00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:24.070 align:start position:0%
military members who are outside the
country

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i think it's wrong to disenfranchise
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
our overseas voters but in particular
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
our military members and anybody who's a
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
vet in this room i think they understand
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
it i'm sure many of you have voted from
 
00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
it i'm sure many of you have voted from
overseas

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
i know i have
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
and so i would say we should not be
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising our overseas voters we
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to risk being a violation of
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
federal law in particular we don't want
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
to take away the secret ballot we have a
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
long history of secret ballot in this
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
country and why would we want to go
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
there for all those things i think it
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
makes more sense to go to interim study
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
and to look at how we can meet the needs
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
of people's concerns about voter
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
registration without violating federal
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
law and without violating individual
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
rights and without violating
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
representative emrick
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's very
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
interesting about this argument is that
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
we're violating uh
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh privacy
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
we don't know who the individual is
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
because they have no id
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
so i don't really think we're violating
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
anybody's privacy because they haven't
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
identified themselves yet
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
as far as the
foreign

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.110 align:start position:0%
foreign
ballots

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
the timing issue will have to be
 
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.470 align:start position:0%
the timing issue will have to be
addressed

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
concept of having an id
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
is supported by this bill
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.470 align:start position:0%
are there any other
comments

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i am going to
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
oppose the amend excuse me the motion
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
of interim study and i would encourage
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to also oppose it so that
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
a motion of ought to pass can be made
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
now this bill came to finance after a
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
vote in the full house of 180 to 154 in
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
favor of ought to pass with amendment
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
now the house amendment
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
allows the bill to only apply to those
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
registering for the first time on
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
election day without proof of his or her
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
identity the intention of the bill is to
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
strengthen election integrity and
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
improve the verification
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
of voter identification and residency
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough it came to light
 
00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:48.029 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough it came to light
that

00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
733 individuals state wide
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the general election of 2020
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
voted without showing an id so they then
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
had to fill out an affidavit now it's
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
unknown how many of those
 
00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
were registering for the first time to
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
vote same-day voter registration but we
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
were assured yesterday by a
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
representative from the secretary of
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
state's office would be a lot less than
 
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.669 align:start position:0%
state's office would be a lot less than
733

00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
733
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps it could be just a couple
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
hundred so that's uh what we're talking
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of numbers uh i would believe
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
that the spending an estimated uh 48 000
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2023 and then 72 000 in
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2025
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
would be certainly reasonable in terms
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
of verifying voter identity for same day
 
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.629 align:start position:0%
of verifying voter identity for same day
voter

00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
voter
 
00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.190 align:start position:0%
voter
registrants

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
registrants
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
that being said you know with regards to
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
to veterans i've seen the ads i've seen
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
the um there was a handout yesterday
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
given to us in division one
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't see a direct correlation the
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
way the house amended the bill to narrow
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
it to same-day voter registrants
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
also with regard to a secret ballot uh
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned and i think worth repeating
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
that a secret ballot in this instance
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
has just as much secrecy as an absentee
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
ballot would have so not a whole lot has
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
changed other than an improved way to
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
verify a person is who they say they are
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i will oppose a
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
motion of interim study thank you madam
 
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.150 align:start position:0%

walls
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um to respond to a few of
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
these articles first of all there's a
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
huge distinction between marked ballots
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
and an absentee ballot our law
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
specifically says you cannot put a mark
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
on a ballot this is going to require
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
putting a specific mark on a ballot that
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
ties the ballot to a specific voter
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
unlike an absentee ballot that is
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
removed from the envelope in an
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
anonymous fashion and then cast
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
separately this is going to be
 
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.470 align:start position:0%
separately this is going to be
consistently

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
put separately so you can always tie the
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
ballot back to a voter it does not
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's not like an absentee there is no
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
longer an anonymous ballot for these
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
people when their ballots have been
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
marked that's one
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
two um
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
the chair of our lovely division one um
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
said that this will have to be dealt
 
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.230 align:start position:0%
said that this will have to be dealt
with

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that we cannot certify on time
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
but the reality is if you pass this bill
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to be dealt with the
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is if you pass this
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
bill if you have challenge ballots and
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
we may have them in many voting places
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
if you have any challenge ballots you
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
cannot possibly certify in time to get
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
the ballots out 45 days ahead of time it
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
is physically impossible so to say it
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
has to be dealt with to me is
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
meaningless how are you going to deal
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
with it when you have just set up a time
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
frame where it's absolutely impossible
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirements and mail them
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
within 45 days
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
finally i think there's nothing here the
 
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that was passed by the houses
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment here does nothing to solve
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
the problem with the military the
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
problem with the fact that we can't get
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
military ballots out within 45 days as
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
required by federal law continues to
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
exist in the bill as it exists which is
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
why again i think interim study is a
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
better approach we have huge problems
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
with this why are we going forward with
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
such a flawed bill let's study it come
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
back and figure out a better way to
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that the idea is out there and
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
finally i might add while we've had talk
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
of this we have not had to my knowledge
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
one prosecution in this state for for
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
false id or failure to provide id this
 
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a solution looking for
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
a problem that we don't even have
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
evidence exists so why are we creating
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
more problems for ourselves violating
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
federal law potentially violating the
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
constitution for a problem that has not
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
even been prosecuted in this state to my
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge and and we know we're going to
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
violate the rights of our soldiers and i
 
00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
think that's wrong
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further comments
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
this repson lin yes i i just want to say
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
i i have to say with due respect to the
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
representative who just spoke i i
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
honestly do not understand the
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
difference that she's trying to draw
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
between an absentee ballot in terms of
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
knowing the identity and and a ballot
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
that would be a provisional ballot
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot somebody opens the
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
envelope they know who it's from they
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
see the name so somebody in the election
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
hierarchy so to speak knows who the
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
voter is that would be the same thing
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
here um it's uh those people are
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
are required to keep the matter
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
confidential there's no um i'm not i
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
just don't uh
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
see the distinction and as i understand
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
i was not present in the in the uh uh
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
election law when when uh this part of
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
the bill was was this this issue was
 
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
discussed but it's my understanding that
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
the that it is possible to uh
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
to complete this within the time
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
required under the uh
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh for the to comply with the overseas
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
representing walls
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
a quick response
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative lynn the difference is
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
that the ballots are marked
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
once you mark the ballot it is forever
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
identifiable with that voter absentee
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
ballots are never marked so maybe the
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
person who opens the envelope chooses to
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
glance at the ballot and see how they
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
vote but they're going to be the only
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
person that knows the minute you mark
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
that ballot everybody who handles that
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
ballot henceforth can tie that back to
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
that voter and henceforth that voter has
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
lost all anonymity that's the difference
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
okay if you would like me to explain on
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
the calendar how we don't meet the the
 
00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:57.839 align:start position:0%
days i would be happy to do it i've got
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
the dates in front of me of how this
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
can't work um but
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
we do not have
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
with with the september 10th primary
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
date and the ballots must be sent out
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
september 21st
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
we are going to have issues on these
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
years some years with our primary
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
meeting this deadline we are not going
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to get the ballots out in
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
time remember after certification they
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
still have to be printed and to get them
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
certified and and then printed and
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
mailed we're not going to be able to
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
sir further representative schultz
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just want to
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
clarify because i didn't understand
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
initially what was meant by saying
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
marked the ballot this means specific to
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
each ballot for example
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh and this was from the working group
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
and an official from the
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office attested to
 
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.349 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office attested to
this

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
that each individual ballot in this
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
category would be marked for example the
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
first one could be
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
voter number one like literally on the
 
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.470 align:start position:0%
voter number one like literally on the
ballot

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
would be marked in that fashion
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
the next one would be
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
ballot number two so beyond the signing
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
of an envelope the actual ballot itself
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
that's what uh the representative means
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
by the ballot is marked
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
this bill requires the use of
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
american-made steel products in all
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
public work projects
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
where the state administers the contract
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
and the contract involves
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
at least a million dollars
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
a million state dollars
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
who told us about the uneven playing
 
00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.549 align:start position:0%
who told us about the uneven playing

field
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
they are forced to compete went in
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
with foreign steel flowing through a
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
heavily subsidized
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
canadian steel fabrication industry
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
we also heard their testimony
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
on the economic
 
00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.549 align:start position:0%

00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
aspects
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
locally produced steel
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
keeping the dollars at home has a
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
multiple effect
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
where if we send the dollars to a
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
foreign country
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
we have no multiple effect at last
 
00:51:01.119 --> 00:51:02.710 align:start position:0%
we have no multiple effect at last
forever

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
forever
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
the committee also feels that a healthy
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
steel industry
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
is very important to our state
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
and our country from a national defense
 
00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.790 align:start position:0%
and our country from a national defense
standpoint

00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
therefore the division one voted
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
to recommend not to pass
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further comments
 
00:51:27.119 --> 00:51:28.710 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further comments
representative

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to rise in opposition to this
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill and hopefully by the end of my
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
short speech i will have some of you
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
on board with what i'm about to say
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
as legislators we are the
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
stewards of taxpayer dollars and
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
especially this committee being the
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee we've even got a a
 
00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:53.349 align:start position:0%
finance committee we've even got a a
greater

00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
greater
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
requirement to be good stewards
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt that
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
will increase stock costs to state
 
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.390 align:start position:0%
will increase stock costs to state
projects

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
we heard during testimonies that
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
estimate it could be estimated between
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
20 25 percent
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
and what's also was not considered and
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
we heard from representative growing
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
firmer senator gruen
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
that um delays
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
he's in the business he said he could
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
expect delays up to a year so not only
 
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.630 align:start position:0%
expect delays up to a year so not only
do

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
would we have increased
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
costs but we would have delays
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
now there are two bills one that's
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
already passed this body and one that we
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
will be discussing later
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
where we we are going to spend 35
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
and 36 million dollars respectively one
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
on a new parking garage for
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
the state legislator
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
legislature and one that we're going to
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
send 36 million dollars out for bridges
 
00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
send 36 million dollars out for bridges
now

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
35 million garage a good percentage of
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
that garage is going to be structural
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
steel and it's going to be pre-stressed
 
00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.549 align:start position:0%
steel and it's going to be pre-stressed
concrete

00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
preset pre-stressed concrete uses iron
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the concrete itself so what is going
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
to be the increased cost for that 35
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
million dollar state garage
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayers are going to have to
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
the steel industry it's not the first
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
time we've seen this
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
type of
 
00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
type of
problem

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
we've seen it in the past with lumber
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen it in the past with computer
 
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.390 align:start position:0%
we've seen it in the past with computer
chips

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
chips
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
on and on and on this is a federal issue
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
this isn't something that we at the
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
attempting to solve it's a much bigger
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
issue that should be handled on the on
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
the on the federal level
 
00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.109 align:start position:0%
the on the federal level
um

00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know and like i say we we've had
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
this issue with lumber computer chips in
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
the past are we going to after we pass
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
this are we going to start requiring
 
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
other procr
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
procurements for other types of things
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
easy example airlines are we going to
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
require all our state people to
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
ride on an american airline to
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
toronto not only will the cost be higher
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
but you're going to add in
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
inconveniences such as instead of going
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
directly from boston to toronto you get
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
on a plane from boston go south an hour
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
to philly and then backtrack up to
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
toronto but
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
we'd be
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
giving the american airline industry a a
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
good boost i don't agree with that
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
now i'm going to give you a final
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
analogy and i ask you to consider this
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
analogy because it's very um
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
illustrative of i think our situation
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
you decide you're going to get a house
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
built and you hire a contractor
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the contractor comes to you and says
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
okay here's the deal i can build your
 
00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:51.750 align:start position:0%
okay here's the deal i can build your
house

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
for three hundred thousand dollars
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i can start in two months
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
however if you want to use all u s
 
00:54:58.799 --> 00:55:00.150 align:start position:0%
however if you want to use all u s
materials

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's gonna cost you an extra twenty
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
thousand so that bill would now be three
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
hundred and sixty thousand dollars
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
oh and because of a lot of the materials
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
i can't get immediately we could have
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
delays up to a year
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
now if you can honestly say to yourself
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
that yes i would pay that three hundred
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars rather rather
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
than the 300 000 for that house because
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
you want to keep your money local
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
then you should vote on this bill if you
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
can honestly say that i don't believe
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
you can
 
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.710 align:start position:0%
you can
uh

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
if you can't if if if you can't be
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
good stewards of your own money
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
personally at least here in the state
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
i will say that i sympathize with the
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
steel industry it's it's not lost on me
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
but i just can't
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
i can't vote for something that will
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
increase the cost to state projects by
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
20 to 25
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
percent we do have to be good stewards
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
of our taxpayers money thank you madam
 
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.630 align:start position:0%
of our taxpayers money thank you madam
chair

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
hatch

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
hatch
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you madam chair if i may i
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
just a
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
query with the last speaker
 
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.670 align:start position:0%
query with the last speaker
um

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're throwing out figures you're using
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
25 percent and you're talking about
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
increased cost and in fact you gave an
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
analogy that used was exactly 20
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
of the whole project cost over um using
 
00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:25.670 align:start position:0%
of the whole project cost over um using
say

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh local products or american-made
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
products or whatever the analogy said
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
i really need to know what those figures
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
are based on because i i'm not sure i
 
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.829 align:start position:0%
are based on because i i'm not sure i
agree

00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
agree
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
that the steel in a project
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
more than much than ten percent
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the total cost of the project um
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
that's one thing it there's variables of
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
course a steel bridge that's different
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
but um your general construction um
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
figures it's usually around a 10 factor
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
um and then um to come up with exact
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
figures where where did you
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
what did you base those out or where are
 
00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
you getting those figures from and
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
that's the sincere question the 20 to 25
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:18.789 --> 00:57:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh the 20-25 were
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
numbers that i uh heard during testimony
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
um and what i will say about your 10 10
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
costs i i will still draw the same
 
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.870 align:start position:0%
costs i i will still draw the same
analogy

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
analogy
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
granted your house doesn't contain a
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
heck of a lot of steel but the idea is
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
not to talk about steel in that analogy
 
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
but the costs involved so let's go to
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
your 10
 
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.030 align:start position:0%
your 10
number

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
if the contractor comes to you and says
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
300 000 or 330 000 if we use all us
 
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.150 align:start position:0%
300 000 or 330 000 if we use all us
materials

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
um are you still willing to pay that 30
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
extra thousand and if you aren't then
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be willing to spend the
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers extra money when when we don't
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you are there representatives yeah
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman um
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
the bill before us deals with uh steel
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
and leveling the the
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
playing field between canada and the
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
united states
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
the one of the previous speakers
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
asserted or assumes that
 
00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:22.799 align:start position:0%
future procurement that we're setting a
 
00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:23.990 align:start position:0%
future procurement that we're setting a
precedent

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
precedent
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
for other materials that would be
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed and we could control of you
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
know and whatnot so i disagree
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is just dealing with
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
steel and not future acquisitions of
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further comments
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
represent emrick thank you madam chair i
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
i believe if you read the bill you'll
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
also find that the
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
it does not afford a provider
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
extended delays
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh or excessive costs
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
the example that was given during
 
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.589 align:start position:0%
the example that was given during
testimony

00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
seven million dollar
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
steal quote that was five hundred
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
more than what the canadian bid was so
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a twenty we're not talking
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
twenty percent necessarily so i would
 
00:59:18.799 --> 00:59:19.589 align:start position:0%
twenty percent necessarily so i would
just

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
caution that
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
a decision maker
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
here at the state in the department of
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
administrative services will look at
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
timely delivery and cost thank you madam
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you are there any
 
00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair i'm i'm deeply conflicted
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
about the vote on this bill um because
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh i am a big believer in
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
free markets and the inability of
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
government at any level
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
to effectively intervene into the
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
marketplace and do so effectively and
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
without unintended consequences
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
so so that would suggest i would vote no
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
on the other hand um
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm taking a look at a situation
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
where i i think for decades we've had a
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
lack of national leadership when it came
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
to treating our trading partners in a
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
way that would respect the american
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
worker and i don't mean the current
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
administration i mean many many many
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
administrations have failed to protect
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
the american worker so that would
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
suggest i'd vote yes
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
so i i don't really know how i'm gonna
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
vote but uh but i i just i don't think
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
anything any further comments
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
represent petrie right thank you madam
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
chair uh one of the things you might
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
think about is
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
money has velocity you keep the gdp
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh that velocity is four to six times i
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
think is naturally used and that's
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's pretty important uh because once
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's gone out of the state it's gone
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
is there anything else on this
 
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
seeing nothing uh will the clerk please
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%

to several sections of rsa 155

01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
consent
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
sp 363

has no
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
general funds in it it's it all it does
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
is allow individuals to pay down
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
their retirement so in essence it's
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%

the funding for that was in the next
 
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so it would be part of the
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
budget but for this fiscal year there's
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%

01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%

uh so this amendment it uh it makes a
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
very simple change it just in the
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
had just indicated that the 150 000

to the hampton beach area commission
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
apparently um as i understand it that's

a no-no it needs to go through a state
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
agency so this simply provides that
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriation would go to the
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
department of natural and cultural

senator reagan
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%

01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%

well yeah
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%

01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
i guess i have questions about
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%

01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%

doesn't it seem like it's sort of
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
short-sighted to all of a sudden be
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
taking away that authority
 
01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.990 align:start position:0%
taking away that authority
yes

01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%

01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
and uh the education committee
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%

what was a s
 
01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.390 align:start position:0%
what was a s
538

01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
538
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
senate bill 538
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
which was looking at all all of the
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
special education things
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
senator reagan so on
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
felt that
 
01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.030 align:start position:0%
felt that
because

01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
so different than the kinds of things
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
child advocate was
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
looking at at this time
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
they wanted it to
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
to separate
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
speak to when
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
after our vote was taken
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
i did
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
remind the people from the education
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee that were there that i wanted
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
them to follow this very closely
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
and to re-look at it within a couple of
 
01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
and to re-look at it within a couple of
years

01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
to see if
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
the special ed office belongs
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
in a separate
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
advocate office or if it should be
 
01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:41.189 align:start position:0%
advocate office or if it should be
convul

01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
convul
 
01:33:41.199 --> 01:33:42.310 align:start position:0%
convul
combined

01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
combined
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
with the office of child advocate
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
everything you said was true but that's
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
basically the reason
 
01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:51.669 align:start position:0%
basically the reason
why

01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
came forward and was was approved and i
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
will say that there were some reluctant
 
01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.590 align:start position:0%
will say that there were some reluctant
yeses

01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
yeses
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
within division two
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
but we felt that it was essential that
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
we have something
 
01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:11.620 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.790 align:start position:0%
for the
[Music]

01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%

01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:22.390 align:start position:0%
special education
advocate

01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
waltz

01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
waltz
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:30.390 --> 01:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
actually this is it i i do have i have
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
two things my first one is a question
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that is given that you want this
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
review does this have a sunset provision
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
in it to force the review no
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
we we did not we did not put that in um
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
i i just want to say i feel i feel very
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
strongly that uh
 
01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
at least one of us will be around on
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
division two
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
in a couple of years
 
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:55.510 align:start position:0%
in a couple of years
and

01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.629 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
they won't forget it guaranteed
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
so no we did not put a sunset closet
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
i sat on the education committee when
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
this bill was hurt and there was
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
extensive testimony
 
01:35:13.590 --> 01:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
of concern that this was creating an
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
ineffective office where people are
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
going to complain to the office but
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to be able to happen
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
because they don't really have the staff
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
to address it and we're kind of just
 
01:35:26.830 --> 01:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
creating something that is going to give
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
parents hope should we say
 
01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.310 align:start position:0%
parents hope should we say
when

01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
the office really is not going to be
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
able to do anything i mean 500 you would
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
need a huge office to address all the
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
complaints in this state and 500 000 is
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
not establishing a huge office okay
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the amendment please
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
my mistake hey i just wonder if the
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee considered that yes we did
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
we considered everything
 
01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
we considered everything
[Laughter]

01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%

this is the uh
 
01:37:58.239 --> 01:37:59.910 align:start position:0%
this is the uh
advocate

01:37:59.910 --> 01:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it's uh to take it out from uh
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
so it's independent an independent
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
agency under the governor
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
to uh look into special ed complaints
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
and appropriation of five hundred
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is super
 
01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:21.510 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is super
appropriate

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative heath
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um as i said in
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee i i really truly believe
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
that this position belongs
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
within the current
 
01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.229 align:start position:0%
within the current
advocacy

01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
advocacy
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
office i think that
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
her role um
 
01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
is critical to the state and i think it
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
has to involve
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
education and particularly special
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
education so i am very concerned that
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
we're setting up two separate offices
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
um we're allocating
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars um for this office for
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
this do i feel like it's kind of like a
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
duplication of efforts and i have my
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent waltz did you want to
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh actually you answered my questions
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
man i'm sure thank you okay thank you
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to add that this
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
was very conflicting
 
01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:26.709 align:start position:0%
was very conflicting
and

01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
for my own part i recognize the need for
 
01:39:29.119 --> 01:39:31.189 align:start position:0%
for my own part i recognize the need for
this

01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that there's a broader role
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
around advocacy where it would be best
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
served within one community
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
but given the situation
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
i was comfortable supporting it as a
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
separate one if we can come back to
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
review it and i think you're right that
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
we you know we will certainly be able to
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:39:48.159 --> 01:39:49.510 align:start position:0%
do that
um

01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:52.709 --> 01:39:52.719 align:start position:0%
i felt that the need was pressing and so
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
i was comfortable with going ahead with
 
01:39:54.239 --> 01:39:55.030 align:start position:0%
i was comfortable with going ahead with
that

01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
because of the need that i perceived
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
but i do
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
really feel strongly that we should
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
look at this again to see if it's best
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
as a separate office i think i share
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
other representatives views that perhaps
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
it would be better in one office where
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
there could be coordination and
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration um but it was this was a a
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
difficult one to to sort of suss out uh
 
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
what's what would be the best thing for
 
01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:21.270 align:start position:0%
what's what would be the best thing for
children

01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative bucco did you wish to say
 
01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:25.270 align:start position:0%
representative bucco did you wish to say
something

01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay oh oh i'm sorry reps represent long
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just for
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
clarification the amendment removes the
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate from
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
education uh but in the bill i don't see
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
would this
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
advocate be responsible for education
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
for children that are placed out of you
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
know that are placed
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
i don't see it in here so i'm wondering
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
if there's this is this is for those
 
01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:51.990 align:start position:0%
if there's this is this is for those
children

01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:40:55.030 --> 01:40:55.040 align:start position:0%

50

01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
50
 
01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.470 align:start position:0%
50
504s

01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
504s
 
01:40:58.480 --> 01:40:59.350 align:start position:0%
504s
okay

01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.550 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
pardon the follow-up if i make sure so
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
that would be uh that would be
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
children and placement also oh yeah
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
if they have those things okay thank you
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
and you ain't actually
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually if i may uh say something see
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
the public or private i believe
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
public or private charter schools yeah
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
charter schools and private schools i
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
believe that's in there
 
01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:25.910 align:start position:0%
believe that's in there
so

01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
so if i may madam chamber i'm just
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
children in placement there was somebody
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
advocating for their educational needs
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
if not the office child advocate it'd be
 
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
i am going to vote no
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
because i'm really concerned about what
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
we do here we
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
we're getting children services and
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
silos we're going to have over here an
 
01:42:07.030 --> 01:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
advocate for special education and over
 
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
have done a lot of work on being sure
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
that we had a child advocate
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
they had
 
01:42:21.910 --> 01:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to oversee
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
children in all settings
 
01:42:27.270 --> 01:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
and now it's just splitting that apart
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
when we had just sort of gotten it
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
together where we had a really
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
comprehensive office
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
i would agree that the office probably
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
could certainly use
 
01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:39.830 align:start position:0%
could certainly use
additional

01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
person power
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
children's services be a special ed
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
be it
 
01:42:52.470 --> 01:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
services for children through
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
protective services
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i i worried that this kind of a bill
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
just is starting again to put us into
 
01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:02.719 align:start position:0%
silos and to split those services so i
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
am going to vote no on this bill thank
 
01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:06.310 align:start position:0%

01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:11.910 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment um
 
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
basically replaces the entire bill
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
that we had
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh the first thing we did
 
01:51:25.710 --> 01:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
was to
 
01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.990 align:start position:0%
was to
[Music]

01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
on recommendation of dot
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
was to change how
 
01:51:35.669 --> 01:51:35.679 align:start position:0%
the bridge money
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:38.229 align:start position:0%
which is
36

01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
36
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:51:44.550 --> 01:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
was to be distributed to the towns
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
as the bill came to us it was supposed
 
01:51:48.870 --> 01:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
to follow
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
the red list
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
red list bridges program
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
well the red list bridges program
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't get money out to the communities
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
very quickly
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
and it also requires a 20
 
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.990 align:start position:0%
and it also requires a 20
match

01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
match
 
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:08.950 align:start position:0%
match
so

01:52:08.950 --> 01:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
the department and the committee felt
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
that it was important
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
got this money out to
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
work on
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
bridges that may be red listed or
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
or maybe
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
just in need of repair
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh and again please understand this is
 
01:52:34.070 --> 01:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
municipal bridges not state bridges
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
so i had no idea
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
that there were so many ways
 
01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:46.470 align:start position:0%
that there were so many ways
to

01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
to decide on how money was going to be
 
01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:50.709 align:start position:0%
to decide on how money was going to be
distributed

01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:52:50.719 --> 01:52:51.990 align:start position:0%
distributed
uh

01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
half of the funds are going to be
 
01:52:55.119 --> 01:52:57.510 align:start position:0%
half of the funds are going to be
distributed

01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:53:01.270 --> 01:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
based on the municipalities total bridge
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
deck area
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay they they actually know the
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
measurement of
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
every municipal state bridge who who
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
would have thought it
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
and then the other 18 million is going
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
to be distributed
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
based on population
 
01:53:22.390 --> 01:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
and that is a common way
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
that dot
 
01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:26.629 align:start position:0%
that dot
distributes

01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
distributes
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
money at this time
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
the second half of the money
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
the the 30 million
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
will be um
 
01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
we'll use the same appropriation as we
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
do in the budget for distribution of um
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
the 30 million
 
01:53:45.599 --> 01:53:46.709 align:start position:0%
the 30 million
in

01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
apportionment a for that's for roads not
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
for bridges
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
and uh this money will go to the towns
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
and it will be non-lapsing
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't um
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't run out
 
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:02.950 align:start position:0%
it doesn't run out
because

01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:04.719 align:start position:0%
if if you
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
have work to do on bridges or roads you
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
generally have engineering that has to
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
occur etc etc
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
so anyhow that's
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's what that part is
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then uh the body warn and dash
 
01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
camera fund
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
we appropriated a million dollars uh to
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
that fund that's basically uh
 
01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
no change at all
 
01:54:30.239 --> 01:54:31.270 align:start position:0%
no change at all
and

01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:33.270 --> 01:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
the final
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
the final thing that we did is that
 
01:54:38.159 --> 01:54:39.430 align:start position:0%
the final thing that we did is that
yesterday

01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
we all sat through the non-germain
 
01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:42.470 align:start position:0%
we all sat through the non-germain
amendment

01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
on uh the dixville colebrook road
 
01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:47.030 align:start position:0%
on uh the dixville colebrook road
project

01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:54:50.149 --> 01:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
so i don't think i need to
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
go through all of that
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
but that's what the amendment
 
01:54:58.629 --> 01:54:58.639 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at and otherwise i
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
think it's um
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
it says amend the bill
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
other than the enacting clause so
 
01:55:10.229 --> 01:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
the enacting clause
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
enacted okay
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative turca
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
i'm unfortunately and regrettably gonna
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
have to rise against the bill as a whole
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
only because of the uh project that you
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned yesterday that was tacked on
 
01:55:38.870 --> 01:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
while i understand
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
the reason it was tacked on
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
and for those who weren't
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
listening to the
 
01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.310 align:start position:0%
listening to the
discussion

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:51.669 align:start position:0%
discussion
it

01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
basically we are
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:55:58.070 --> 01:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
allow 4.1 million dollars to be spent to
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
upgrade a road that would
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.589 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
the balsams
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
project and or the county
 
01:56:12.149 --> 01:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
towns that are involved with that
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
that road um
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
in talking about the balsams projects i
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
think it's kind of important that we do
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
discuss that because it's still
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
very little has been done on that to
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
date and
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
um they're still in the financing phase
 
01:56:28.639 --> 01:56:30.950 align:start position:0%
um they're still in the financing phase
there

01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing is when you look at four
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
million as a percentage of the total
 
01:56:35.599 --> 01:56:37.189 align:start position:0%
million as a percentage of the total
project

01:56:37.189 --> 01:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
which is estimated at over 200 million
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
dollars you're looking at about a two
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
percent cost
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
i i believe there are
 
01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
other ways um that we as the legislature
 
01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
and coordination with the dot or safety
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
department or the attorneys or whatever
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
a better way and more fiscally
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
responsible way that we could
 
01:57:02.070 --> 01:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
turn that
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
two-mile segment that connects the
 
01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:05.910 align:start position:0%
two-mile segment that connects the
balsam's

01:57:05.910 --> 01:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
balsam's
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
main hotel area with the
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
golf course i think there are more
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible ways that we can
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
so again for that reason
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
only because that was added i cannot
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
support the bill as a whole thank you
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further comments
 
01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:28.390 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further comments
yes

01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh represent petrie yeah thank you madam
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
chair one of the things you i'd like to
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
point out is that this is a
 
01:57:37.510 --> 01:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
more or less abandoned state road and
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
what they're gonna do is
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh or what this bill proposes is to
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
build it up to standards
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
and to give it to the town of colebrook
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
i believe so that's something to
 
01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:48.870 align:start position:0%
i believe so that's something to
weigh

01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
weigh
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
in in your decision thank you
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
are there any further
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps in murray
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i would just
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
like to put into people's minds that
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
looking at this just with regards to the
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
balsams is somewhat narrow that this is
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
a good economic development project that
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
would impact
 
01:58:09.750 --> 01:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
the north country it's a fairly small
 
01:58:11.350 --> 01:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
investment from our point of view but it
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
would have a very large impact on the
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
economy in the north country and so i
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
very much support that we're able to do
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
something like this to help them out
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:58:21.119 --> 01:58:22.390 align:start position:0%

clad
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
and that not it would not spend one
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
penny of taxpayers money unless the
 
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
financing was there
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
represent turcotte yeah
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
one point i forgot to make
 
01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:16.430 align:start position:0%
was that the
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:18.709 align:start position:0%
was that the
[Music]

01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
this portion of the road um
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
is not contained in the
 
01:59:25.910 --> 01:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
dot's 10-year plan that was brought up
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
at the our hearing
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
um both the house and the senate um
 
01:59:34.149 --> 01:59:34.159 align:start position:0%
we're not in favor of including that in
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
um i i do understand the potential
 
01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
um i i do understand the potential
for

01:59:39.910 --> 01:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
um economic impact up there but as i
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
said the project is
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
still in what i would almost consider
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
the infancy stage
 
01:59:53.430 --> 01:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
dot plan or
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
once the project actually makes a little
 
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
more progress
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
that we could
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
readdress this situation in the future
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sure thank you
 
02:00:06.719 --> 02:00:10.149 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sure thank you
represent

02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:00:11.599 --> 02:00:12.870 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to understand and
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think representative tuberge alluded
 
02:00:20.310 --> 02:00:20.320 align:start position:0%
to this or somebody may have that
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely none of this money
 
02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:23.510 align:start position:0%
absolutely none of this money
zero

02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
zero
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
ditto will be utilized unless the
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
project is in position to go forward
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
and that is important to know and
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
understand it's not like we're throwing
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
good money after bad money
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
but this road is a vital part
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
to this project it was once on the
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and um maybe it belongs
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
here again but the only reason we have
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation it's not there and
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
just remember that this is not a unheard
 
02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:57.189 align:start position:0%
just remember that this is not a unheard
of

02:00:57.189 --> 02:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:00:57.199 --> 02:00:58.550 align:start position:0%
of
proposition

02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
proposition
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
by a development we can go all over this
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
great land of ours in this state and
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
find development after development that
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
has had a road brought up to grade and
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
prior to being turned back to the
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
community or the state that process
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
takes place
 
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's vitally important for the north
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
country it's vitally important for the
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh communities and it's vitally
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
important for the state
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
that this project go forward and this
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
would really
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
benefit the likelihood of that going
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
forward immensely
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
without costing
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
one penny
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%

02:05:48.310 --> 02:05:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you man i'm sure i i suspect i'm
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
going to be on the in the minority on
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
this i
 
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote uh no and the reason
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to vote now is because
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think across the nation there
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
will be a shortage of pilot programs for
 
02:06:05.270 --> 02:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
electronics or electric school buses
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
and so anything we might learn from
 
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
running our own demo i think we could
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
learn by just coordinating with other
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
entities to include some of our own
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
towns here in new hampshire that i
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
understand is doing this
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
the only reason this uh project i the
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
only positive reason for doing this
 
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
project is is that it's not our money
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
it's federal money and um and so
 
02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
occasionally i just feel like i need to
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
vote to say that federal money is not
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
free and even if it goes to another
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
state that's okay
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
um because i don't know that uh the the
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
life cycle funding for this pilot
 
02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
life cycle funding for this pilot
program

02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
will be included because at some point
 
02:06:48.629 --> 02:06:48.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to dispose of the
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle we're going to have to dispose
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
of the battery and i still have never
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
heard of a good way for these electric
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
batteries to be um
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
recycled and
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i i do think so many of these parts
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
are coming from china that we do not
 
02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
want to become dependent upon that
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
supply chain so so i'll be voting now
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative wyler
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to this war on fossil fuels
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
because i don't see that the alternative
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
is is any better
 
02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:23.109 align:start position:0%
is is any better
and

02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
we are impoverishing the people of this
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
country by this push on alternative
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
fuels which are not successful thank you
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
represent waltz
 
02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman as somebody who
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
drives an electric car i can tell you
 
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
drives an electric car i can tell you
that

02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's wonderful there's a lot of positive
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
things to it but one of the problems
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
with it is when it gets cold the battery
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
loses some of its life and i would like
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
to see a school bus trial here in new
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire in this climate so that we can
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
begin to address the issues that come
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
with the economic climate we're in so i
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
understand the the thought that maybe
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
other states would run a pilot program
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
that we can piggyback off of but unless
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's a state with a climate near ours i
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
think it's a problem that's not
 
02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to be addressed
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to see the pilot program in
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
our state just so that we can understand
 
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
how we deal with this cold weather with
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other comments
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
representing heath thank you madam chair
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about school buses
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about children
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about our environment
 
02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
and we we know that we're seeing climate
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
change in our world today
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
i just think we're going to be modeling
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
the kinds of
 
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:38.950 align:start position:0%
the kinds of
new

02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
scientific research that's coming out
 
02:08:43.109 --> 02:08:43.119 align:start position:0%
and our students will have the
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
opportunities to participate in it i
 
02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
just think this is an excellent
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for our state i'm not a
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
science teacher but if i were a science
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
teacher i'd be jumping up and down about
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
this possibility i just think it offers
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
so much
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
and it's it's uh the potential for the
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
learning aspects of all this is great so
 
02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
i would encourage folks to vote yes on
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're not voting on the pilot we're
 
02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:15.599 align:start position:0%
voting on the amendment
 
02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:16.950 align:start position:0%
voting on the amendment
okay

02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
so we we need to keep that in mind
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments on the
 
02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:23.430 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments on the
amendment

02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
yes you may i thank you i just and the
 
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
other thing i wanted to say is to the
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
extent that we need a pilot program
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
i think we need it to increase our
 
02:09:36.079 --> 02:09:37.830 align:start position:0%
i think we need it to increase our
electrical

02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
electrical
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
electricity generation capacity last
 
02:09:43.589 --> 02:09:43.599 align:start position:0%
couple of summers we've seen our grid
 
02:09:46.629 --> 02:09:46.639 align:start position:0%
hit a 90 percent utilization level
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me yeah we're not that's not
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
talking to the amendment please
 
02:09:53.669 --> 02:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
i i i okay
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
i'll shut up i'll i'll call on you when
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
we go to the bill and you can discuss
 
02:09:58.719 --> 02:10:00.870 align:start position:0%
we go to the bill and you can discuss
that

02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%

02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
represent edwards
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
you had some comments about the electric
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
pilot program i i did thank you for uh
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
giving me a shot to correct myself i i
 
02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:40.950 align:start position:0%
giving me a shot to correct myself i i
i

02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
we have so much hope for a clean future
 
02:11:48.069 --> 02:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
based on use of electricity
 
02:11:48.079 --> 02:11:48.950 align:start position:0%
based on use of electricity
what

02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that people are not
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
paying attention to is where does that
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
electricity come from it's still going
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
to have to come from somewhere
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see us do nukes i'd i would
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
rather see
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
i would rather see a pilot project on
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
electrical generation
 
02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:08.629 align:start position:0%
electrical generation
then

02:12:08.629 --> 02:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
another way to consume electricity
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's no limit to how we can consume
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%

equalized valuation really meant
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%

so

02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:52.560 align:start position:0%

was too broad
 
02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
and so we
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
cut it down to where it is just
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%

02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
i think it's just property and utilities
 
02:16:11.679 --> 02:16:16.229 align:start position:0%
i think it's just property and utilities
right

02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%

who have very little property value
 
02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:00.469 align:start position:0%
who have very little property value
additional

and
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
if their evaluation is a million or less
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
they'll receive 650 per pupil
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
and if they're between one
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
million one and
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%

they will receive a grant equal to
.00013

02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
or each dollar of difference between the

02:18:37.599 --> 02:18:38.549 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation and the per pupil
cost

cost
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
so anyhow and if you're over six million
 
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
you don't receive anything six billion
 
02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:45.349 align:start position:0%
you don't receive anything six billion
valuation

02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
valuation
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
oh yeah billion
 
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
yeah one no
 
02:18:52.629 --> 02:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
one two three one two three that's
 
02:18:52.639 --> 02:18:56.230 align:start position:0%
one two three one two three that's
millions

02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:56.240 --> 02:18:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:18:59.190 --> 02:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
yeah it's not very much
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
so anyhow when um when the bill came to
 
02:19:07.599 --> 02:19:08.950 align:start position:0%
so anyhow when um when the bill came to
us

02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.230 --> 02:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
wanting to raise the uh
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
amount for special education that was
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
sent to the schools and that was over 29
 
02:19:23.830 --> 02:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
and we felt that
 
02:19:28.790 --> 02:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
we could not commit ourselves
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
to an additional
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
uh 29 million dollars out of the
 
02:19:36.070 --> 02:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
education fund in uh
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
in 2024
 
02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:40.150 align:start position:0%
in 2024
so

02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh this this is not
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
a new thought process um
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
we've worked on it uh several times in
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
various study committees that we've had
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey is uh
 
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
is just um
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
bringing this to us
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
02:20:09.990 --> 02:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative comments i should not
 
02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
question about a comment yes
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:18.230 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
i

02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
i i will be voting against it um
 
02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.630 align:start position:0%
i i will be voting against it um
the

02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
total funding on this
 
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
was somewhere in the neighborhood of
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
14.6 million and i apologize i was
 
02:20:31.110 --> 02:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
writing up the
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh blurb on it and somehow i lost it
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
and so my percentages may be a little
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
bit off here but
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
out of that 14.6 million two cities in
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
the state would get and i'm going to go
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
off memory here
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere around 25 percent of all that
 
02:20:50.710 --> 02:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
14.6 million and when i tallied the five
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
top towns who were going to be receiving
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh it was slightly over 50 it might have
 
02:20:57.750 --> 02:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
been something like 53. don't hold me to
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:01.349 align:start position:0%
those numbers
um

02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:03.349 --> 02:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
and what was even more remarkable was
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
that over half the towns
 
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
at least 50 percent from just looking at
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
the data we were provided would get
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing now i understand the
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
intent of it but i also understand that
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
on top of every other program that
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
already exists
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
so in dis
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
distributing or
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
as i would say redis redistributing
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
these funds it appears to be going to
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
a select few towns i and when you're
 
02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
talking 14.6 million i just don't think
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
fair and equitable thank you madam chair
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
quite welcome are there any other
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
comments representative heath
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um this these
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
funds were meant to be targeted for
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
those school districts with the highest
 
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
levels of free reduced lunch students
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
therefore those towns and municipalities
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
that get less it's because their free
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch numbers are so low so
 
02:22:00.399 --> 02:22:01.590 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch numbers are so low so
um

02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
i asked for your support for this bill

02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
they've changed the locking system
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
and after five o'clock your keys don't
 
02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:33.110 align:start position:0%
and after five o'clock your keys don't
work

02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:44:37.030 --> 02:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
anymore oh no yeah so don't go out if
 
02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
you expect to get back in
 
02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:42.070 align:start position:0%
you expect to get back in
okay

02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah you can get out
 
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
but but you can't get back in
 
02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:49.590 align:start position:0%
but but you can't get back in
so

02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:52.230 align:start position:0%

02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
it used to be that we could get in but
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
now you can't
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh i guess that um
 
02:45:04.469 --> 02:45:04.479 align:start position:0%
you can still get in at park street
 
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
you can go that way
 
02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:09.750 align:start position:0%
you can go that way
and

02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%

go ahead sorry okay so um what we're
 
02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do here
 
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
is conduct
 
02:55:41.269 --> 02:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
a good functional behavioral assessment
 
02:55:45.510 --> 02:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
earlier on in the process there was a
 
02:55:48.389 --> 02:55:48.399 align:start position:0%
there has been a gray zone
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
where um the
 
02:55:50.479 --> 02:55:51.990 align:start position:0%
where um the
localities

02:55:51.990 --> 02:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
localities
 
02:55:53.990 --> 02:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
had clear obligations of when they
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
should conduct a functional behavior
 
02:55:58.710 --> 02:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
assessment but there was a some gray
 
02:56:00.870 --> 02:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
area about when the state was
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for for it so what this bill
 
02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:04.790 align:start position:0%
responsible for for it so what this bill
did

02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
was it clarified that the state is
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing a functional
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
behavior assessment in particular
 
02:56:12.479 --> 02:56:13.750 align:start position:0%
behavior assessment in particular
scenarios

02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios
 
02:56:14.950 --> 02:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
having that
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
is expected to cost
 
02:56:20.070 --> 02:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
some money i'm trying to recall the the
 
02:56:22.070 --> 02:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
exact amount i think the first two years
 
02:56:23.550 --> 02:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
was something like
 
02:56:25.510 --> 02:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
1.2 million
 
02:56:26.950 --> 02:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
belief on the
 
02:56:32.230 --> 02:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
director ross who who runs this thing
 
02:56:34.630 --> 02:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
thinks that the benefits of having an
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
earlier functional behavioral assessment
 
02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
will have us do
 
02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
placements earlier and more
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately and that and that there's
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
actually an opportunity to avoid things
 
02:56:47.429 --> 02:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
like some of the out-of-state placements
 
02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
saving us
 
02:56:51.429 --> 02:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
money she thinks this could be a net win
 
02:56:52.870 --> 02:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
the finance group looked at it on
 
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not that investment was going
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
to have a return on it and if it was
 
02:57:01.190 --> 02:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
adding value and we determined that it
 
02:57:01.200 --> 02:57:01.990 align:start position:0%
adding value and we determined that it
did

02:57:01.990 --> 02:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:57:04.389 --> 02:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
02:57:04.399 --> 02:57:06.469 align:start position:0%

so this section 29 of this multi-part
 
02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
hp 430
 
02:58:57.760 --> 02:58:58.630 align:start position:0%
hp 430
was

02:58:58.630 --> 02:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
requested a change was requested by the
 
02:59:02.710 --> 02:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:59:03.910 --> 02:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
the section
 
02:59:05.750 --> 02:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
relates to reviewing and investigating
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
all records of the new hampshire
 
02:59:10.150 --> 02:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
hospital and related and they wanted to
 
02:59:12.870 --> 02:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
add in the hampshire hospitals a quote
 
02:59:14.469 --> 02:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
the hampstead hospital or other
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
state-owned facilities that provide
 
02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
child inpatient psychiatric treatment
 
02:59:20.309 --> 02:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
within the state mental health system
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
and relates to their being able to start
 
02:59:25.110 --> 02:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
basically working on the contract to
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
make recommendations regarding pricing
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth charge of care
 
02:59:30.469 --> 02:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
and all that thank you are there any
 
02:59:32.710 --> 02:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
yes just procedural i think that the
 
02:59:38.790 --> 02:59:38.800 align:start position:0%
motion was made on
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh amendment 107
 
02:59:44.469 --> 02:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
one but i think fourteen seven zero one
 
02:59:46.150 --> 02:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
seven zero one okay one so i wanted to
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
make sure for the record sorry thank you
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
correctly it's me
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay the record's correct thank you uh
 
02:59:54.870 --> 02:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
02:59:57.670 --> 02:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay all those
 
02:59:59.510 --> 02:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
certainly uh represent everything that
 
03:00:01.590 --> 03:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative earth said that is true
 
03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
the the downside is if uh we don't pass
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
03:00:08.710 --> 03:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
what what we're asking dhhs to do is to
 
03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
go ahead and begin negotiating
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
commercial rates before we've closed the
 
03:00:15.030 --> 03:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
final deal on hampstead and so this
 
03:00:18.070 --> 03:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed to allow them to
 
03:00:20.230 --> 03:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
get in front of the process enough so
 
03:00:22.710 --> 03:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
that if we do close we'll have the
 
03:00:25.269 --> 03:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
commercial rates negotiated upon opening
 
03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's why you're seeing
 
03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
hampstead hospital
 
03:00:31.590 --> 03:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
this early in the process i recommend
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
you vote yes
 
03:00:36.630 --> 03:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a show of hands
 
03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:46.389 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a show of hands
uh

03:00:46.389 --> 03:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
yeah one seven zero one
 
03:00:50.950 --> 03:00:50.960 align:start position:0%

age who are enrolled in school and
 
03:01:55.910 --> 03:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
determined eligible for services that
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
are not the responsibility of a local
 
03:02:00.389 --> 03:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
education agency another state agency or
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
another division of the part department
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
participation in the program should be
 
03:02:06.389 --> 03:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
limited to not more than 20 eligible
 
03:02:08.309 --> 03:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
individuals the only thing we changed in
 
03:02:10.550 --> 03:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
this section was allowing the funds to
 
03:02:13.110 --> 03:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
lapse as is typically the case
 
03:02:14.389 --> 03:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank mountain chair
 
03:02:16.790 --> 03:02:16.800 align:start position:0%

remainder of the amendment
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
well the amendment's huge but it's
 
03:02:22.150 --> 03:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
basically replacing something that's
 
03:02:23.510 --> 03:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
already in the bill the only thing that
 
03:02:25.030 --> 03:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
we replaced was literally we took out
 
03:02:26.309 --> 03:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
the words and the funds shall be
 
03:02:29.429 --> 03:02:29.439 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing okay so everything else
 
03:02:31.349 --> 03:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
that's here was in the original bill as
 
03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
approved by the policy committee that
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%

all right thank you
 
03:02:43.670 --> 03:02:43.680 align:start position:0%

03:02:54.790 --> 03:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:03.190 --> 03:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%

2022-1823
[Music]

03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
i believe we're talking about 1783
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:43.670 --> 03:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
the there there is also a one eight two
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
three but it's uh subsequent to this one
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
i believe oh i thought that was part of
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
that last one
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:56.150 --> 03:03:56.160 align:start position:0%

uh this is uh one seven eight three so i
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
would move
 
03:04:02.710 --> 03:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
amendment two zero two two one seven
 
03:04:04.469 --> 03:04:04.479 align:start position:0%

03:04:07.359 --> 03:04:08.790 align:start position:0%
uh s b four thirty do i have a second
second

03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:04:10.240 --> 03:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:13.429 --> 03:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
i'd love to speak to it i thought so
 
03:04:17.750 --> 03:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
so this
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
deletes section six of the multi-part
 
03:04:21.359 --> 03:04:23.030 align:start position:0%
deletes section six of the multi-part
sp430

03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
sp430
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
that section
 
03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:26.469 align:start position:0%
that section
was

03:04:26.469 --> 03:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
changing the reporting that dhhs does
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
regarding related to the medicaid family
 
03:04:35.110 --> 03:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
planning services annual report and it
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
essentially removed the annual report
 
03:04:40.309 --> 03:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
so by deleting it we are effectively
 
03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
leaving the annual report
 
03:04:45.190 --> 03:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
of the medicaid family planning services
 
03:04:46.950 --> 03:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
in place
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further comments on
 
03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further comments on
amendment

03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%

03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor please
 
03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:01.359 --> 03:05:07.269 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

03:05:07.269 --> 03:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:10.790 --> 03:05:10.800 align:start position:0%

all right now i can move to amendment
2022-1823h

03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%

now i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna back up and
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of background on this
 
03:05:40.950 --> 03:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
because uh the background i think is
 
03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
relevant um
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
this this language may look familiar to
 
03:05:47.349 --> 03:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
you all because
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
this language is identical all the way
 
03:05:52.230 --> 03:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
down to the final comma
 
03:05:52.240 --> 03:05:53.110 align:start position:0%
down to the final comma
to

03:05:53.110 --> 03:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:05:56.309 --> 03:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
house bill one zero four four
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
one zero four four was passed by the
 
03:06:01.190 --> 03:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
house sent to the senate the senate took
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
it and put it into interim study
 
03:06:07.030 --> 03:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's become a topic of interest
 
03:06:08.710 --> 03:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
that the house would like to discuss
 
03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
this in a committee a conference and so
 
03:06:13.030 --> 03:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
we've been asked to
 
03:06:15.990 --> 03:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
take another run up the hill on this
 
03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
take another run up the hill on this
now

03:06:16.950 --> 03:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
i wasn't sure what the procedures were
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
so it
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
by the time i asked the clerk and the
 
03:06:24.630 --> 03:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
clerk could get back to me
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
i had eaten two of the three days the
 
03:06:29.349 --> 03:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
committee had to work on it and so
 
03:06:29.359 --> 03:06:31.670 align:start position:0%
committee had to work on it and so
unfortunately

03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
our blue team colleagues
 
03:06:37.349 --> 03:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
did not get a chance to see this until
 
03:06:40.550 --> 03:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
yesterday and so what i promised
 
03:06:42.790 --> 03:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
the ranking member was that
 
03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
i would make sure that she had plenty of
 
03:06:48.309 --> 03:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to weigh in on any concerns
 
03:06:50.230 --> 03:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
that she has um
 
03:06:52.469 --> 03:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
so but but what does it do first and
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
then we can talk about why it's bad but
 
03:06:57.670 --> 03:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
what it does first is uh
 
03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:04.870 --> 03:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
health facilities that are membership
 
03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
based or
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
on predicated on a direct payment
 
03:07:10.389 --> 03:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
business model
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
from having
 
03:07:14.150 --> 03:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirement to provide
 
03:07:17.830 --> 03:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
services to all persons so so it it it
 
03:07:19.349 --> 03:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
does not become a
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
does not like we do with our other
 
03:07:23.910 --> 03:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
facilities does not require them to
 
03:07:26.550 --> 03:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
participate in sort of an urgent care
 
03:07:26.560 --> 03:07:27.750 align:start position:0%
participate in sort of an urgent care
setting

03:07:27.750 --> 03:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
setting
 
03:07:27.760 --> 03:07:29.269 align:start position:0%
setting
um

03:07:29.269 --> 03:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
03:07:31.990 --> 03:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
some concerns were raised that
 
03:07:37.269 --> 03:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
would put pressure on our critical care
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
facilities because these
 
03:07:45.990 --> 03:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh different the this group of
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
facilities that operate in a different
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
business model
 
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
may have
 
03:07:52.710 --> 03:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
unfair competitive advantage that could
 
03:07:55.750 --> 03:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
cause our critical care facilities to to
 
03:07:58.150 --> 03:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
go belly up and we don't no one wants
 
03:08:01.429 --> 03:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
that no one wants that so so i i checked
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
and there there is still that provision
 
03:08:03.760 --> 03:08:04.469 align:start position:0%
and there there is still that provision
in

03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law that
 
03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
no competitive facilities
 
03:08:13.429 --> 03:08:13.439 align:start position:0%
for service can operate within 15 miles
 
03:08:15.670 --> 03:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
unless it's permitted by the state i'm
 
03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
unaware of any being permitted by the
 
03:08:20.150 --> 03:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
state and because this is a new business
 
03:08:22.469 --> 03:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
model that we're trying to grow some of
 
03:08:24.870 --> 03:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
us are trying to grow as an alternative
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
to uh the fee for service systems
 
03:08:30.550 --> 03:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
um we we wanted to exempt them
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
from having to treat people who are not
 
03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
in their membership or is not are not
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
enrolled in their direct pay method
 
03:08:40.230 --> 03:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
so so i i i think this is a good thing
 
03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative mclean introduced it in
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
the house and passed the house
 
03:08:46.230 --> 03:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
and with that um
 
03:08:46.240 --> 03:08:47.269 align:start position:0%
and with that um
if

03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:08:49.349 --> 03:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh i guess representative weiler you're
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
the acting chair could
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
could we allow representative walner
 
03:08:56.790 --> 03:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
with the time she wants to talk to this
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
president wallner is recognized
 
03:09:02.550 --> 03:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.560 --> 03:09:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:09:03.670 --> 03:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:09:05.910 --> 03:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
i do have a lot of concerns about this
 
03:09:09.990 --> 03:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
these providers will not be required
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
like all of our other health care
 
03:09:16.389 --> 03:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
providers to accept
 
03:09:16.399 --> 03:09:17.990 align:start position:0%
providers to accept
medicaid

03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:19.269 align:start position:0%
medicaid
and

03:09:19.269 --> 03:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:19.279 --> 03:09:20.070 align:start position:0%
and
this

03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
really will leave could leave a burden
 
03:09:22.960 --> 03:09:23.830 align:start position:0%
really will leave could leave a burden
on

03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:09:23.840 --> 03:09:24.790 align:start position:0%
on
our

03:09:24.790 --> 03:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:09:28.229 --> 03:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
most of the hospitals that
 
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
have spoken to us
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
oppose this this piece of legislation
 
03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:37.510 align:start position:0%
oppose this this piece of legislation
and

03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:38.710 align:start position:0%
and
i

03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:09:41.349 --> 03:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
am concerned about the department of
 
03:09:43.110 --> 03:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh really monitor this and
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
they they do do the licensing
 
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
of healthcare facilities and i think
 
03:09:54.870 --> 03:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
this is going to
 
03:09:57.269 --> 03:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
be a whole new area that they are going
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
to have to be
 
03:09:58.560 --> 03:09:59.670 align:start position:0%
to have to be
um

03:09:59.670 --> 03:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:02.070 --> 03:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
licensing so i'm concerned about i'm
 
03:10:04.150 --> 03:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
certain one thing that's very concerning
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
is the quick turnaround time and the
 
03:10:07.349 --> 03:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
time that the
 
03:10:09.590 --> 03:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
hospital the time that the department
 
03:10:10.790 --> 03:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
would need
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
to really be able to license this type
 
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
of facility
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
i think it sets up a very dangerous
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
precedent to be um
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
setting up a group of health care
 
03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
providers who will not have to accept
 
03:10:26.080 --> 03:10:27.510 align:start position:0%
providers who will not have to accept
medicaid

03:10:27.510 --> 03:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
eligible clients and
 
03:10:32.309 --> 03:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
i think it's something that
 
03:10:33.830 --> 03:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
we need to give
 
03:10:35.429 --> 03:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of thought to
 
03:10:35.439 --> 03:10:36.389 align:start position:0%
a lot of thought to
and

03:10:36.389 --> 03:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:36.399 --> 03:10:37.269 align:start position:0%
and
as

03:10:37.269 --> 03:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:10:37.279 --> 03:10:38.309 align:start position:0%
as
chairman

03:10:38.309 --> 03:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:10:40.469 --> 03:10:40.479 align:start position:0%
edward said this sort of came in at the
 
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
last minute though it was a bill that
 
03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:44.229 align:start position:0%
last minute though it was a bill that
passed

03:10:44.229 --> 03:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
past the house which is now in the
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
senate so i assume that there will be
 
03:10:50.710 --> 03:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
ample opportunity to keep discussing it
 
03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:57.030 --> 03:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
i have one and i said it at the uh
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
division work session
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
all these other hospitals that get a
 
03:11:07.429 --> 03:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
break because they have emergency rooms
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
they don't pay property taxes they don't
 
03:11:12.229 --> 03:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
pay meals and rooms taxes they don't pay
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
 
03:11:14.239 --> 03:11:15.510 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
so

03:11:15.510 --> 03:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:17.429 --> 03:11:17.439 align:start position:0%
they get a big break worth millions of
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
dollars and in return we expect them to
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
hold emergency
 
03:11:23.750 --> 03:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh services available for anybody that
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
walks in and
 
03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
it isn't as if they they do treatment
 
03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
for xero because they all get medicaid
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
everybody they treat if they're not
 
03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
getting medicaid they're getting
 
03:11:35.830 --> 03:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
medicare or private insurance so
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
in these
 
03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals that we speak of that we're
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
newly allowing
 
03:11:43.269 --> 03:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
end up paying all the taxes so
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
i think there's a balance in my mind
 
03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
there to
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
to what what we require of the others
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they don't want
 
03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:51.269 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they don't want
competition

03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
competition
 
03:11:52.710 --> 03:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
they're forgetting all the breaks we
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
give them that should be helping them to
 
03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
pay for the care that they call free but
 
03:11:59.830 --> 03:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
is always charged to medicaid
 
03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:03.590 align:start position:0%
anybody else
representative

03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:04.710 align:start position:0%
representative
hatch

03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
hatch
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair i'm i just um this
 
03:12:09.910 --> 03:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
isn't my area
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
of endeavor but
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
i have worked with hospitals in the past
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
and our non-profit hospitals
 
03:12:21.110 --> 03:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
though they may not pay property taxes
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the bet and a few other taxes they
 
03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
do add to the community tremendously and
 
03:12:28.830 --> 03:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
and you might find a few
 
03:12:31.349 --> 03:12:31.359 align:start position:0%
non-proprietary places
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
pay in lieu of taxes to local
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
communities and they help support the
 
03:12:37.590 --> 03:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
tax base in that community
 
03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
tremendously they also
 
03:12:40.239 --> 03:12:41.510 align:start position:0%
tremendously they also
treat

03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
treat
 
03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:42.710 align:start position:0%
treat
people

03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:12:44.550 --> 03:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
you say they charge for and charge
 
03:12:47.349 --> 03:12:47.359 align:start position:0%
yearly maybe they do but they also
 
03:12:49.510 --> 03:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
treat people without charging for it
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
they also give free care and we know
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
this very well because
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
every year or every budget cycle we look
 
03:12:59.510 --> 03:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
at uncompensated care and that's exactly
 
03:13:02.309 --> 03:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
what that is it's these institutions
 
03:13:04.389 --> 03:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
brought these people in
 
03:13:06.309 --> 03:13:06.319 align:start position:0%
and gave them care
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
without any reimbursement for doing so
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
where your propriety hospital
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
isn't required to do that so what
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
happens is um in the
 
03:13:21.429 --> 03:13:21.439 align:start position:0%
my concern and and that's above my pay
 
03:13:23.590 --> 03:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
rate to figure this out exactly and i
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
think maybe this is why um maybe our hhs
 
03:13:29.110 --> 03:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
department needs to
 
03:13:31.830 --> 03:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
time to figure this out is there's only
 
03:13:33.990 --> 03:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
so many dollars there for reimbursement
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
period and there's only so many dollars
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
that our non-proprietary hospitals get
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
now one thing they depend on is i have
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
private insurance
 
03:13:47.670 --> 03:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
my insurance pays my local hospital
 
03:13:49.510 --> 03:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
full tilt
 
03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
all right i may have a copay on a phil
 
03:13:54.950 --> 03:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
few but they pay him full tilt
 
03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
and why that is important is it allows
 
03:14:00.630 --> 03:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
anascoggin valley hospital
 
03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
to have the resources
 
03:14:04.469 --> 03:14:04.479 align:start position:0%
to stay within the community pay the
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
personnel and provide this very
 
03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
necessary care to people that do not
 
03:14:11.910 --> 03:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
have insurance and do not have the
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
resources to pay for it they die
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds dramatic but i've seen it
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
firsthand it's the real deal
 
03:14:22.950 --> 03:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
my sons were emts
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
more than once they've taken people with
 
03:14:26.469 --> 03:14:26.479 align:start position:0%
no resources
 
03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
up to our local hospitals they got the
 
03:14:30.870 --> 03:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
care they needed and why did they get
 
03:14:31.910 --> 03:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
that care
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
again what i just stated is
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
my insurance company for our care pays
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
the full boat and it gives the hospital
 
03:14:42.389 --> 03:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
those resources so let's think about
 
03:14:43.750 --> 03:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
03:14:43.760 --> 03:14:45.030 align:start position:0%
what happens
to

03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:47.830 --> 03:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
the people that no longer maybe would go
 
03:14:49.830 --> 03:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
to anderscoggin or would they would go
 
03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:50.630 align:start position:0%
to anderscoggin or would they would go
to

03:14:50.630 --> 03:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
one of these non uh these proprietary
 
03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are often kind of glitzy
 
03:14:57.990 --> 03:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
and nice and chooses to go there to get
 
03:15:00.070 --> 03:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
their care
 
03:15:01.830 --> 03:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
say i do
 
03:15:03.190 --> 03:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:15:05.910 --> 03:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
my local hospital will get a hell of a
 
03:15:07.750 --> 03:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
lot less money
 
03:15:10.309 --> 03:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
on a given year that is
 
03:15:12.150 --> 03:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
important to them to provide the care
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
they pry provide because the hospital
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
down here that might have a little
 
03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
better room for me or
 
03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
whatever um that i go to
 
03:15:24.550 --> 03:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
gets the money that
 
03:15:26.790 --> 03:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
they used to utilize to provide the care
 
03:15:29.349 --> 03:15:29.359 align:start position:0%
so it's it's complicated
 
03:15:31.750 --> 03:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's deep and it's way beyond me to
 
03:15:33.910 --> 03:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
figure out but i know what i just stated
 
03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
is absolute and i do know of areas
 
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
where these types of hospitals
 
03:15:40.870 --> 03:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
went into
 
03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
and the ones that provide the free care
 
03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
whatever that is
 
03:15:47.750 --> 03:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
or provide the community the needed
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
services that it needs
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so people maybe don't die so often on
 
03:15:53.670 --> 03:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
the street
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
will not survive and that's real stuff
 
03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's real stuff and i think we should
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
allow some time to figure this out thank
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
03:16:06.870 --> 03:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative lynn yes this
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
is really a question i would i guess i
 
03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
would direct it to either representative
 
03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
walner or representative edwards this
 
03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
this is obviously not my area but
 
03:16:17.910 --> 03:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think you both
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
sort of mentioned that kind of concerns
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
me is that this
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
kind of came up on relatively short
 
03:16:27.030 --> 03:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
notice that there wasn't a lot of time
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
to sort of think about this and and you
 
03:16:31.510 --> 03:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
know get a lot of input and
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
so i have some concern about that i i
 
03:16:33.600 --> 03:16:34.710 align:start position:0%
so i have some concern about that i i
guess

03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:16:36.309 --> 03:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you you mentioned
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative edwards that i think i
 
03:16:39.269 --> 03:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
sort of had in the back of my mind but i
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
had forgotten about is apparently
 
03:16:41.910 --> 03:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
there's still
 
03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have a certificate of need
 
03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
board anymore but there's still this
 
03:16:46.550 --> 03:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
15-mile thing
 
03:16:48.150 --> 03:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
i i guess i
 
03:16:50.870 --> 03:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know i wonder how much actual
 
03:16:53.190 --> 03:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
protection that provides in the sense
 
03:16:55.750 --> 03:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
that at 15 you know does that really
 
03:16:59.110 --> 03:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
make much of a difference in people in
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know when it was i guess to me of
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
whether a doctor's office was in 15
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
miles or 25 miles of wind it wouldn't
 
03:17:05.670 --> 03:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
make that much difference to me i would
 
03:17:07.510 --> 03:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
think but
 
03:17:09.190 --> 03:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i'm just saying is that
 
03:17:11.190 --> 03:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
may be something that needs
 
03:17:11.200 --> 03:17:12.469 align:start position:0%
may be something that needs
further

03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
further explanation in terms of its
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
implications for this and then the last
 
03:17:18.870 --> 03:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
thing that i have is am i understanding
 
03:17:20.229 --> 03:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
from this
 
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
um from this proposal
 
03:17:23.040 --> 03:17:24.309 align:start position:0%
um from this proposal
that

03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:27.750 --> 03:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
the the the the uh
 
03:17:30.229 --> 03:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
the facilities that would be uh where it
 
03:17:32.229 --> 03:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
says the the facilities that are covered
 
03:17:34.630 --> 03:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
by the unless clause
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
that they would not have any obligation
 
03:17:39.030 --> 03:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
to provide services even in an emergency
 
03:17:41.190 --> 03:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
situation in other words there was a gun
 
03:17:42.870 --> 03:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
shot somebody came in with a gunshot
 
03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
wound could they just say you know sorry
 
03:17:47.590 --> 03:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
we don't uh
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:55.030 --> 03:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
president edwards you wish to answer so
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
i i heard i heard two questions i heard
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
a question about has there been
 
03:18:01.590 --> 03:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to vet this and i've
 
03:18:04.870 --> 03:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
heard uh you do a desire to hear more
 
03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
about the urgent care setting
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
on the first point
 
03:18:12.229 --> 03:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
i would just remind
 
03:18:16.349 --> 03:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
everyone that this bill as hb
 
03:18:16.359 --> 03:18:17.910 align:start position:0%
everyone that this bill as hb
1044

03:18:17.910 --> 03:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
1044
 
03:18:20.309 --> 03:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
went through the policy committee and
 
03:18:23.190 --> 03:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
passed and so that policy committee said
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
this is good and not just the policy
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee but the entire house then
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
subsequently took a vote on it passed it
 
03:18:32.469 --> 03:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
and sent it over to the senate
 
03:18:32.479 --> 03:18:33.349 align:start position:0%
and sent it over to the senate
so

03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:36.070 --> 03:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
while it is true that division three
 
03:18:38.469 --> 03:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
didn't have much time to look at it as
 
03:18:38.479 --> 03:18:39.349 align:start position:0%
didn't have much time to look at it as
i'm

03:18:39.349 --> 03:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
often reminded we don't do policy we
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
just do money
 
03:18:45.590 --> 03:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
all right and so
 
03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
so this is the policy of the policy
 
03:18:48.160 --> 03:18:49.269 align:start position:0%
so this is the policy of the policy
committee

03:18:49.269 --> 03:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:18:52.389 --> 03:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
and it it it doesn't have
 
03:18:52.399 --> 03:18:53.990 align:start position:0%
and it it it doesn't have
um

03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
a direct obvious
 
03:18:59.510 --> 03:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
impact on general funds so
 
03:19:02.630 --> 03:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of in the category of of
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
approve it because it's outside of our
 
03:19:08.070 --> 03:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
financial purview
 
03:19:09.349 --> 03:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
03:19:11.110 --> 03:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
as you're talking about the urgent care
 
03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:12.950 align:start position:0%
as you're talking about the urgent care
setting

03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
setting
 
03:19:14.870 --> 03:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
some of these institutions can just be
 
03:19:18.870 --> 03:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
concierge kind of eight to five places
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
and and they aren't
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily open 24 by seven so so the
 
03:19:26.630 --> 03:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
point of of this model
 
03:19:29.349 --> 03:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
is to be flexible and adaptable to the
 
03:19:29.359 --> 03:19:30.469 align:start position:0%
is to be flexible and adaptable to the
market

03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
and and see if there's an alternative
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
way of delivering care that consumer
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
choice will then go select
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the concerns i hear about
 
03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
this because i'm a simple person i i
 
03:19:45.190 --> 03:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
kind of summarize it is that we're
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
consider we're concerned about what
 
03:19:51.670 --> 03:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
consumers may choose if we allow them to
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
and as i recall we were promised that if
 
03:19:56.469 --> 03:19:56.479 align:start position:0%
we liked our health insurance if we
 
03:19:59.110 --> 03:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
liked our doctor we could keep them
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
so now here's an opportunity to make
 
03:20:04.790 --> 03:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
good on that promise from 10 years ago
 
03:20:07.750 --> 03:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
by creating a choice in the market that
 
03:20:14.309 --> 03:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:14.319 --> 03:20:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:20:15.510 --> 03:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:19.750 --> 03:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
so i guess if
 
03:20:22.389 --> 03:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
this is more of a process
 
03:20:22.399 --> 03:20:23.670 align:start position:0%
this is more of a process
statement

03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:20:26.710 --> 03:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
i guess if you liked house bill 1044 you
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to vote on it
 
03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
whenever it was a couple weeks ago a few
 
03:20:32.309 --> 03:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
03:20:34.150 --> 03:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
and it's over in the senate
 
03:20:36.550 --> 03:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the process
 
03:20:38.550 --> 03:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's a paul it was strictly a policy
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill and it went straight to the floor
 
03:20:44.070 --> 03:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
and had a vote on the policy and it's
 
03:20:46.389 --> 03:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
over there and if you like that policy
 
03:20:48.630 --> 03:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
it passed and it's on its way to the
 
03:20:48.640 --> 03:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
it passed and it's on its way to the
senate

03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
but before us we have
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
03:20:53.760 --> 03:20:54.830 align:start position:0%
a bill
that

03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:59.110 --> 03:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
contains a lot of really important
 
03:21:02.469 --> 03:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation the department has
 
03:21:05.190 --> 03:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
been working on this bill
 
03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
during this whole session
 
03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
and if you look and we read through the
 
03:21:10.469 --> 03:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
bill you'll see
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of things in this bill
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
that need to happen it's a very
 
03:21:18.550 --> 03:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
important piece of legislation
 
03:21:21.030 --> 03:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i feel it is really an abuse of the
 
03:21:21.040 --> 03:21:22.229 align:start position:0%
and i feel it is really an abuse of the
process

03:21:22.229 --> 03:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
to bring in a bill a stand-alone bill
 
03:21:27.590 --> 03:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
and put it into
 
03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
a bill that is so important to the
 
03:21:32.550 --> 03:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
03:21:34.469 --> 03:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
and it certainly isn't something that
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
they have asked for need or want
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
it'll probably only end up causing them
 
03:21:42.630 --> 03:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
03:21:45.990 --> 03:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of grief to tell you the truth
 
03:21:49.030 --> 03:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i i really feel it's
 
03:21:50.469 --> 03:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
it is really
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
outside of the finance committee's
 
03:21:56.630 --> 03:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to be adding
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
this piece which is strictly policy
 
03:22:03.190 --> 03:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
if if there was a financial
 
03:22:05.590 --> 03:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
part of this i might understand how it
 
03:22:07.510 --> 03:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
would fit but i can't even make a
 
03:22:09.190 --> 03:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
finding there's not even a financial
 
03:22:10.630 --> 03:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
argument here
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
um so i urge you not to
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
pass this amendment i do want to remind
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
all of you
 
03:22:19.750 --> 03:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
and all of you live in communities that
 
03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:20.630 align:start position:0%
and all of you live in communities that
have

03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:22:23.429 --> 03:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
hospitals or you use hospitals that are
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
close to your community
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
how important your hospital is and the
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
great benefits they provide to us
 
03:22:32.550 --> 03:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
and you're right
 
03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
if i have no money at all
 
03:22:37.830 --> 03:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i fall down and break my leg
 
03:22:39.750 --> 03:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
as i leave the state house i can go
 
03:22:41.670 --> 03:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
right up to concord hospital emergency
 
03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
room and they will take care of me
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
because that's their obligation the
 
03:22:48.070 --> 03:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
state says you have to do that now we're
 
03:22:49.830 --> 03:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
setting up a group of providers who
 
03:22:51.990 --> 03:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
won't have to do that
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:22:59.670 --> 03:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and i apologize for my
 
03:23:01.830 --> 03:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
ignorance on on the legislative
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
procedure on this but here's my question
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
if we
 
03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:06.870 align:start position:0%
if we
um

03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
reject this amendment
 
03:23:10.080 --> 03:23:11.030 align:start position:0%
reject this amendment
does

03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
what's the implica can that issue
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
of whether it should be it should be in
 
03:23:17.670 --> 03:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
or out
 
03:23:19.590 --> 03:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
be raised in a conference committee or
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
if we take it if we sort of reject this
 
03:23:23.510 --> 03:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
is that the end of it it cannot be
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
raised in a conference committee
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
it if we rejected it will not be part of
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
senate bill 430
 
03:23:31.990 --> 03:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they've gone to
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
interim study on 1044
 
03:23:36.070 --> 03:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't even allow for a committee
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
conference to bring the subject up
 
03:23:39.910 --> 03:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
someone could try it in the committee a
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
conference bringing this up again but
 
03:23:44.229 --> 03:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the chances would be
 
03:23:46.150 --> 03:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
but it's always possible it could be
 
03:23:46.160 --> 03:23:47.429 align:start position:0%
but it's always possible it could be
introduced

03:23:47.429 --> 03:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
03:23:49.590 --> 03:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
but i would like to say that there's
 
03:23:52.710 --> 03:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
there's 26 hospitals in this state
 
03:23:54.229 --> 03:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
and in the
 
03:23:56.469 --> 03:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
30 years i've been watching this they
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
have not allowed any competition one of
 
03:24:01.750 --> 03:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons we got rid of the um
 
03:24:03.510 --> 03:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
certificate of need
 
03:24:03.520 --> 03:24:04.389 align:start position:0%
certificate of need
was

03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:24:06.309 --> 03:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
they would do everything in their power
 
03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
any new medical facility from opening up
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then some they put out a business
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
that were clinics
 
03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:14.229 align:start position:0%
that were clinics
and

03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
they they really abused their power in
 
03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
my mind and as i said they're getting a
 
03:24:20.469 --> 03:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
lot of breaks and taxes in order to pay
 
03:24:22.150 --> 03:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
for all the services that we think
 
03:24:24.150 --> 03:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
they're giving away but they also get
 
03:24:25.830 --> 03:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
disproportionate share and all those
 
03:24:27.190 --> 03:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
other things i'd like to see more
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
competition in this health field and i
 
03:24:31.269 --> 03:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
think by passing this we could do that
 
03:24:33.429 --> 03:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:24:33.439 --> 03:24:35.670 align:start position:0%
anybody else
representative

03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:24:37.670 --> 03:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure if
 
03:24:39.910 --> 03:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
the your question was exactly answered
 
03:24:42.389 --> 03:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
correct i believe you asked as if this
 
03:24:44.550 --> 03:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
was put into the bill if it could be
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
addressed further when we got to a
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
03:24:49.830 --> 03:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
i believe the answer to that would be
 
03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:53.110 align:start position:0%
i believe the answer to that would be
yes

03:24:53.110 --> 03:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:54.950 --> 03:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you appreciate it
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
alternatively if it's not put in it's
 
03:24:59.110 --> 03:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
what representative weiler said it's a
 
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
dead letter
 
03:25:01.439 --> 03:25:02.550 align:start position:0%
dead letter
right

03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:25:04.870 --> 03:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:25:07.030 --> 03:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
all right we're we're ready to have a

03:32:28.229 --> 03:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
actual number is
 
03:32:30.550 --> 03:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
1.7 million dollars i think two of the
 
03:32:32.790 --> 03:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
four programs were actually removed
 
03:32:34.790 --> 03:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
before it got to us
 
03:32:37.510 --> 03:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
but more importantly all of these funds
 
03:32:39.269 --> 03:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
are american
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:45.190 --> 03:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:55.510 --> 03:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
either the two representatives
 
03:32:57.830 --> 03:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
um mentions arpa funds
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
should opera funds uh run out at some
 
03:33:04.710 --> 03:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
point in the future for this program
 
03:33:07.830 --> 03:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
does this program it notes that it is a
 
03:33:09.190 --> 03:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
pilot program
 
03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
is there a drop dead date on this
 
03:33:11.359 --> 03:33:18.870 align:start position:0%
is there a drop dead date on this
program

03:33:18.870 --> 03:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
well there's only
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
sorry there's only one year of funding
 
03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:33:27.030 --> 03:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation so
 
03:33:29.910 --> 03:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to continue if there was
 
03:33:33.510 --> 03:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
um if the pilot was successful and they
 
03:33:35.110 --> 03:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to continue the program it would
 
03:33:37.349 --> 03:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
have to be included in the next budget
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
the next biennium budget so this doesn't
 
03:33:41.750 --> 03:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
go past the
 
03:33:45.269 --> 03:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:52.469 --> 03:33:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
represent them to bears thank you madam
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
chair uh i was reading the methodology
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
and it says if the op funds are not
 
03:34:01.670 --> 03:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
available any other federal funds may be
 
03:34:01.680 --> 03:34:03.910 align:start position:0%
available any other federal funds may be
used

03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
used
 
03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be specific to a
 
03:34:06.479 --> 03:34:07.830 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be specific to a
certain

03:34:07.830 --> 03:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
certain
 
03:34:09.590 --> 03:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
like health related or something not
 
03:34:11.830 --> 03:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
just any in general is it
 
03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
is that legal
 
03:34:14.950 --> 03:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
well i imagine they would have to use
 
03:34:17.190 --> 03:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
funds that the federal government had
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
set aside for this
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
type of program they wouldn't be able to
 
03:34:23.030 --> 03:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
use highway funds or well
 
03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
i was confused thank you because this is
 
03:34:24.960 --> 03:34:25.990 align:start position:0%
i was confused thank you because this is
any

03:34:25.990 --> 03:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
you know federal funds i think the
 
03:34:29.349 --> 03:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
health department of health and human
 
03:34:31.190 --> 03:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
services would have to look into the
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
funds that would be available for this
 
03:34:35.510 --> 03:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
type of program okay thank you
 
03:34:39.030 --> 03:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:41.349 --> 03:34:41.359 align:start position:0%

yes madam chair i'd like to move sp 458

03:36:27.030 --> 03:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
division three voted six to one to adopt
 
03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
the children and family law policy
 
03:36:31.110 --> 03:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation in full it
 
03:36:34.710 --> 03:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
passed the house on a 244 to 88 vote
 
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
it contains two parts
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
first it added hb 254 which passed the
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
house on a 264 to 87 vote
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
hb 254 continues the legislature's long
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
standing philosophy of reducing the
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
types of criminal activities for which
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
commitment to the
 
03:36:56.309 --> 03:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
sununu center is possible in favor of
 
03:36:57.750 --> 03:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
treating as many of these children as
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
possible in the community
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
second the bill provides for a new
 
03:37:05.349 --> 03:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
six-bed replacement facility for the
 
03:37:07.349 --> 03:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
03:37:09.670 --> 03:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
division iii looked to the department of
 
03:37:11.830 --> 03:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
health and human services for guidance
 
03:37:13.990 --> 03:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the cost of construction of a six-bed
 
03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:15.110 align:start position:0%
on the cost of construction of a six-bed
facility

03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
but we're told the time frame was too
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
short to address this
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
much of the sb 458 discussion in the
 
03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:23.670 align:start position:0%
much of the sb 458 discussion in the
division

03:37:23.670 --> 03:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
centered around the six-bed replacement
 
03:37:28.790 --> 03:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
facility for the sonuna center put forth
 
03:37:31.349 --> 03:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
by the policy committee
 
03:37:33.750 --> 03:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
director ribsum related how during his
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
tenure which i believe is four or five
 
03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:37.030 align:start position:0%
tenure which i believe is four or five
years

03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
the census at the sununu center has
 
03:37:42.070 --> 03:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
decreased from something over 70 when he
 
03:37:45.670 --> 03:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
arrived to 11 as of march 24th of this
 
03:37:45.680 --> 03:37:47.190 align:start position:0%
arrived to 11 as of march 24th of this
year

03:37:47.190 --> 03:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:37:49.349 --> 03:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
he also related that the substantial
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
investment new hampshire is making in
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
the system of care for youth should
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
continue this downward trend over the
 
03:37:58.469 --> 03:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
next four to five years
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
as younger miners are drawn into the
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
system at a younger age when the system
 
03:38:05.590 --> 03:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
is better able to impact their lives and
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
their environment
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is likely to bring the census down
 
03:38:11.030 --> 03:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
into the lower end of the ranges being
 
03:38:13.990 --> 03:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
discussed over this time period
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
this points to the need for us to be
 
03:38:16.560 --> 03:38:17.510 align:start position:0%
this points to the need for us to be
careful

03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
careful
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
not to invest dollars in an overly large
 
03:38:20.239 --> 03:38:21.750 align:start position:0%
not to invest dollars in an overly large
facility

03:38:21.750 --> 03:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:38:24.309 --> 03:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
given the downward trend and need for a
 
03:38:27.030 --> 03:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
sununu-style lockdown facility over the
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
past few years
 
03:38:32.229 --> 03:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
the anticipated effect of hb 254
 
03:38:34.309 --> 03:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
and the anticipated continuation of this
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
trend as the system of care continues to
 
03:38:38.790 --> 03:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
build out we should be looking to the
 
03:38:41.349 --> 03:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
future and not the present and making
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
determinations about what to build as a
 
03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:45.590 align:start position:0%
determinations about what to build as a
replacement

03:38:45.590 --> 03:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
03:38:48.229 --> 03:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
the house policy committee allowed for
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
the same final completion date as the
 
03:38:51.279 --> 03:38:52.830 align:start position:0%
the same final completion date as the
senate

03:38:52.830 --> 03:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
senate
 
03:38:52.840 --> 03:38:54.790 align:start position:0%
senate
2026

03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
2026
 
03:38:57.590 --> 03:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
this is fully four years from now
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
in the 2026 time frame a bed a six-bed
 
03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
facility is realistic
 
03:39:05.590 --> 03:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
this would lower the cost of
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
construction relative to a larger
 
03:39:07.279 --> 03:39:08.389 align:start position:0%
construction relative to a larger
facility

03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
and lower the staffing costs somewhat
 
03:39:12.550 --> 03:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions or
 
03:39:14.399 --> 03:39:15.429 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions or
comments

03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
sorry represent edwards the other one
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah the other one uh okay so i'm the
 
03:39:23.590 --> 03:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
only one that voted against us in
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
division three and i voted against it
 
03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
because uh i i
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
did not hear the department say that six
 
03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
was achievable uh
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
i heard that on hope and aspiration and
 
03:39:41.429 --> 03:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
belief that the system of care so that
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
we are building out but is not yet
 
03:39:46.950 --> 03:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
currently proven uh throughout
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
is uh it gives us the assurance we need
 
03:39:53.590 --> 03:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
to go from our
 
03:39:53.600 --> 03:39:54.870 align:start position:0%
to go from our
data

03:39:54.870 --> 03:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:39:54.880 --> 03:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
data
to

03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
six beds
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
so what does our data tell us uh our
 
03:40:01.269 --> 03:40:01.279 align:start position:0%
data tells us
 
03:40:05.110 --> 03:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
that um the census at the sununu center
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
is somewhere between 10
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
14 18 depending on the kind of the
 
03:40:13.189 --> 03:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
monthly blip
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and and
 
03:40:15.920 --> 03:40:17.110 align:start position:0%
and uh and and
ignoring

03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
ignoring
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
that data a number six was picked out of
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
the air
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
if you listen to the exec session by
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
children and family law the chairman
 
03:40:25.840 --> 03:40:27.269 align:start position:0%
children and family law the chairman
basically

03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:40:27.279 --> 03:40:28.229 align:start position:0%
basically
said

03:40:28.229 --> 03:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
as much
 
03:40:29.279 --> 03:40:30.469 align:start position:0%
as much
that

03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:32.870 --> 03:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
let's just make it six and then let
 
03:40:35.830 --> 03:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
finance negotiate it up from there
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
and so uh i read that as an abdication
 
03:40:41.189 --> 03:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
of our responsibility
 
03:40:44.070 --> 03:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
to plan effectively to communicate
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
clearly to the senate what we think
 
03:40:48.389 --> 03:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
and it's an abdication of our
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility to public safety because
 
03:40:54.630 --> 03:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the capacity to store
 
03:40:56.469 --> 03:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
not store but to
 
03:40:56.479 --> 03:40:57.750 align:start position:0%
not store but to
house

03:40:57.750 --> 03:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:40:57.760 --> 03:40:59.269 align:start position:0%
house
these

03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
people these young people
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
in a secure environment when they need
 
03:41:04.319 --> 03:41:05.189 align:start position:0%
in a secure environment when they need
it

03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
then we're going to be endangering the
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
public safety so before i am comfortable
 
03:41:13.750 --> 03:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
doing that i would want to walk through
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
the the the plan i would want to know
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
when these other
 
03:41:20.309 --> 03:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
catcher's mitts are going to be
 
03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
available so that they
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
that that these youth do not need to be
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh locked
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh in the into the sununu-like center so
 
03:41:31.199 --> 03:41:34.710 align:start position:0%
uh in the into the sununu-like center so
i

03:41:34.710 --> 03:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:36.710 --> 03:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
in the last two years this this is this
 
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
is the low point of the term for me
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
having this bill come out this way i'm
 
03:41:44.870 --> 03:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.469 --> 03:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments are there
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
any other comments uh representative
 
03:41:51.910 --> 03:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
lynn yes um thank you madam chair
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
i have to say respectfully that i really
 
03:41:57.349 --> 03:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
think this bill is not ready for prime
 
03:41:58.950 --> 03:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
time i
 
03:42:01.349 --> 03:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
as you know i made my pitch on the floor
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh with with uh both 254 and this and
 
03:42:07.189 --> 03:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
and the the part of
 
03:42:10.150 --> 03:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
of uh this bill that essentially added
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
254 and i would note representative
 
03:42:16.150 --> 03:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
erf mentioned the the various votes um
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
in the in the vote
 
03:42:18.479 --> 03:42:19.670 align:start position:0%
in the in the vote
um

03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
the last time that this bill was up the
 
03:42:24.790 --> 03:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
vote um you know at least in in my
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
caucus was uh eight uh i over eighty
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
percent of the people in my caucus
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
agreed with with my position on the bill
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
no no that's that's uh
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
the that doesn't mean the but the bill
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
didn't pass but i would raise a couple
 
03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
of things that i i think are i hope
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
you'll consider because i think they're
 
03:42:44.150 --> 03:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
very important
 
03:42:47.429 --> 03:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
first of all as i said before this
 
03:42:49.830 --> 03:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
adopting this bill will make us as far
 
03:42:52.870 --> 03:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
as i know will make us the only state in
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
the country that says that a a minor can
 
03:42:58.150 --> 03:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
never be committed
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh to a juvenile facility
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
for a property related crime no matter
 
03:43:05.189 --> 03:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
how serious how much property is taken
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
how much property is damaged
 
03:43:09.750 --> 03:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
and incidentally on that the one of the
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things i hope you'll think
 
03:43:11.120 --> 03:43:12.150 align:start position:0%
one of the things i hope you'll think
about

03:43:12.150 --> 03:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
i went to the division three
 
03:43:17.750 --> 03:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
um uh hearing on this and and as you
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
know this bill this the 254 section of
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
this bill says a jew
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
a minor can never be committed for a
 
03:43:26.399 --> 03:43:27.670 align:start position:0%
a minor can never be committed for a
misdemeanor

03:43:27.670 --> 03:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
well lo and behold at that hearing one
 
03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the people from the disabilities
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
rights center this is not someone who
 
03:43:37.590 --> 03:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
normally i'm on the same wavelength with
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
but one of the people from the
 
03:43:41.110 --> 03:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
disabilities rights center said
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
please don't make this only felonies
 
03:43:45.429 --> 03:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
because if if
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
if it has to be a felony for somebody to
 
03:43:50.309 --> 03:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
be committed what's going to happen is
 
03:43:52.550 --> 03:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and judges are going to make
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
something that might
 
03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
be negotiated down to a misdemeanor
 
03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to treat it as a felony if
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's the only way that somebody can be
 
03:44:02.550 --> 03:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
committed and they believe that there
 
03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be a commitment this wasn't
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
this you know this wasn't a particular
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
argument of mine it was an argument
 
03:44:11.830 --> 03:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the disabilities rights center
 
03:44:13.750 --> 03:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that i lost on the
 
03:44:16.550 --> 03:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
floor as i said before i voted for the
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
bill the basic bill itself because i
 
03:44:21.269 --> 03:44:21.279 align:start position:0%
believed that we really did need to do
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
something about the sununu center i was
 
03:44:25.349 --> 03:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
and i was thinking that you know there
 
03:44:27.510 --> 03:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
would be some there would be
 
03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
some negotiation
 
03:44:32.630 --> 03:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
before this committee of having a uh
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
of of exactly how many beds it should be
 
03:44:36.870 --> 03:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
something more than six
 
03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
but it didn't turn out that way i would
 
03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
just note finally the final commit
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
point i would make is my recollection is
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with representative edwards
 
03:44:49.269 --> 03:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of what mr ribson said about a
 
03:44:52.229 --> 03:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
six bed facility and i would note in
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
support of my recollection being correct
 
03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
that after the committee took its vote
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
as i was sitting in the back as mr
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
ribson was lead was leaving he turned to
 
03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
me and said this is nuts
 
03:45:07.030 --> 03:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
um so for all of those reasons i simply
 
03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:17.590 --> 03:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none oh i'm sorry represent
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
walnut i just want to add one
 
03:45:21.990 --> 03:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
small thing but it's not really small
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
but it's just something to for us all to
 
03:45:26.469 --> 03:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
03:45:28.389 --> 03:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
we have been working on building out the
 
03:45:30.150 --> 03:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
system of care
 
03:45:30.160 --> 03:45:31.349 align:start position:0%
system of care
and

03:45:31.349 --> 03:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:33.750 --> 03:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
right now we have
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
in contract
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
and we learned this from mr ribson
 
03:45:40.870 --> 03:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
over 400 beds
 
03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
in group homes at all different levels
 
03:45:44.790 --> 03:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
but presently there's probably only 300
 
03:45:51.349 --> 03:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
between 280 and 320 children in those
 
03:45:54.389 --> 03:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
beds so we do have capacity
 
03:45:54.399 --> 03:45:55.990 align:start position:0%
beds so we do have capacity
in

03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
our group homes to
 
03:45:58.479 --> 03:46:00.790 align:start position:0%
our group homes to
provide

03:46:00.790 --> 03:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:46:03.189 --> 03:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
living situations residential care for
 
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
children who
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
do not need to be at the sununu center
 
03:46:10.150 --> 03:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
but do need residential care so there is
 
03:46:12.790 --> 03:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
capacity and yes mr ribson said they're
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
having hard time hiring
 
03:46:14.800 --> 03:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
having hard time hiring
and

03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:46:15.760 --> 03:46:17.110 align:start position:0%
and
their

03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
sununu center is having a hard time
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
hiring too everybody's having a hard
 
03:46:22.630 --> 03:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
time hiring so that's
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
um but we do have a contract with about
 
03:46:30.790 --> 03:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
03:46:34.950 --> 03:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i i just i would like i would
 
03:46:36.630 --> 03:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
ask representative walner if she could
 
03:46:39.349 --> 03:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
clarify her use of the word all
 
03:46:43.110 --> 03:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
when you said that all of the
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
residents at sununu could be put into
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think you did you said all
 
03:46:54.070 --> 03:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
that there's capacity for all of the
 
03:46:56.309 --> 03:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
well okay i won't ask you what you said
 
03:46:57.910 --> 03:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
because i apparently i'm just getting it
 
03:47:00.150 --> 03:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
wrong but what i think i heard
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:47:05.349 --> 03:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
we could choose as an option to move
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
sununu kids into group homes and i think
 
03:47:11.110 --> 03:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
that there's a
 
03:47:14.229 --> 03:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
security distinction
 
03:47:18.150 --> 03:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
level three level four level five and
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
what sununu is represents a level five
 
03:47:23.670 --> 03:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
security environment where they they
 
03:47:23.680 --> 03:47:24.550 align:start position:0%
security environment where they they
have

03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
all the you know
 
03:47:28.389 --> 03:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
double security and cameras and all of
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
that uh and the best we have in a group
 
03:47:34.389 --> 03:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
home situation is a level four
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
so so if we have an excess of six kids
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
that need level five security and we
 
03:47:43.910 --> 03:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
move them into a level four
 
03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
that is the exact threat to public
 
03:47:50.469 --> 03:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.469 --> 03:47:56.479 align:start position:0%
i did think i heard representative
 
03:47:56.479 --> 03:47:58.150 align:start position:0%
i did think i heard representative
representative

03:47:58.150 --> 03:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
director rip some say that often
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
children leave the sununu center and go
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
into group homes
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
so the a lot of the goal is to try to
 
03:48:06.960 --> 03:48:07.830 align:start position:0%
so the a lot of the goal is to try to
move

03:48:07.830 --> 03:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
move
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
to move
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
the kids out of the sununu center and
 
03:48:11.760 --> 03:48:12.790 align:start position:0%
the kids out of the sununu center and
into

03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:48:15.510 --> 03:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
maybe they go into a level four or three
 
03:48:18.309 --> 03:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
level three group home so that we try to
 
03:48:20.469 --> 03:48:20.479 align:start position:0%
move them out into the community as
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
quick as we can so you having a small
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
facility for those most serious
 
03:48:27.439 --> 03:48:30.309 align:start position:0%
facility for those most serious
violent

03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
children that's the way
 
03:48:34.229 --> 03:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative edwards
 
03:48:34.239 --> 03:48:35.590 align:start position:0%
okay representative edwards
so

03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
so i agree with you that the goal is to
 
03:48:40.830 --> 03:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
do a step down into less secure
 
03:48:43.750 --> 03:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
environments but my point remains if
 
03:48:45.990 --> 03:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
there is a seventh kid that needs level
 
03:48:47.830 --> 03:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
five we don't have an answer for that
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
seventh kid
 
03:48:49.680 --> 03:48:50.630 align:start position:0%
seventh kid
so

03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:52.630 --> 03:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
anytime you move that incremental
 
03:48:52.640 --> 03:48:53.830 align:start position:0%
anytime you move that incremental
individual

03:48:53.830 --> 03:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:48:53.840 --> 03:48:54.830 align:start position:0%
individual
from

03:48:54.830 --> 03:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
needing level five into a lower level of
 
03:48:58.720 --> 03:49:00.309 align:start position:0%
needing level five into a lower level of
security

03:49:00.309 --> 03:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
security
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're you're adding public safety risk
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
in the equation that that that's all i'm
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
saying and you're absolutely right we
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
want to step these down kids down we
 
03:49:11.189 --> 03:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
want them to feel
 
03:49:13.110 --> 03:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
warmth and love and
 
03:49:15.670 --> 03:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
but some of some of these kids are just
 
03:49:15.680 --> 03:49:16.550 align:start position:0%
but some of some of these kids are just
not

03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:49:23.030 --> 03:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further comments
 
03:49:27.349 --> 03:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
i have a question of uh representative
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
edwards certainly uh where do you stand
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
to me talking to mike
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.790 --> 03:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
i i assume that's a joke i i am
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm a
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
here's the problem
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
where do that's a really great question
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
where am i now
 
03:49:50.150 --> 03:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
because we failed to plan and because
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
this is the only vehicle to continue the
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
planning process
 
03:49:55.189 --> 03:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
we are in a
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
god-awful place where we have to pass
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
this to keep the process going if we
 
03:50:03.269 --> 03:50:03.279 align:start position:0%
kill this then
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
there is no bill
 
03:50:07.750 --> 03:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
and there is no plan to handle
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
what happens because the current law
 
03:50:12.550 --> 03:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
says sununu closes at the end of march
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
um and there's no plan other than this
 
03:50:15.199 --> 03:50:15.990 align:start position:0%
um and there's no plan other than this
plan

03:50:15.990 --> 03:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:50:17.990 --> 03:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
which is why this plan was so important
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's so devastating that we failed to do
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
it right
 
03:50:22.640 --> 03:50:23.670 align:start position:0%
it right
so

03:50:23.670 --> 03:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:26.469 --> 03:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
ironically i hope you all vote yes but
 
03:50:30.630 --> 03:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.469 --> 03:50:32.479 align:start position:0%
yes may i make just one one other
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
comment and i want to thank
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
representative walsh for this because i
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
i had i had completely i don't think i'm
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i really
 
03:50:40.630 --> 03:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh had focused on this and i certainly
 
03:50:42.070 --> 03:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't understand it until she
 
03:50:43.830 --> 03:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
brought it to my attention but if it's
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
true as i as i'm sure it is that that
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
under the was it the prison rape
 
03:50:50.469 --> 03:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
elimination act uh
 
03:50:52.469 --> 03:50:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh even an adult
 
03:50:54.550 --> 03:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
even an adult i mean sorry even someone
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
that is treated as as an adult for
 
03:51:00.229 --> 03:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
purposes of of criminal prosecution if
 
03:51:02.790 --> 03:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're if they're convicted they cannot
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
serve their sentence in an adult
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
facility they need to go to a juvenile
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
unless unless they're separate
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
separate uh which as i understand it
 
03:51:14.150 --> 03:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state prison doesn't
 
03:51:14.160 --> 03:51:15.990 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state prison doesn't
have

03:51:15.990 --> 03:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
right so so stop and think about this
 
03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here is
 
03:51:22.389 --> 03:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
that six
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
the number of people
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
under 18 who will be serving a sentence
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
for any crime for any crime either as an
 
03:51:31.439 --> 03:51:32.870 align:start position:0%
for any crime for any crime either as an
adult

03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
adult
 
03:51:35.429 --> 03:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
or the crimes that are that under under
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
the 254 aspect of this would be limited
 
03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
for which a minor might be committed are
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
going to be six people for the whole
 
03:51:42.800 --> 03:51:43.750 align:start position:0%
going to be six people for the whole
state

03:51:43.750 --> 03:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
six people
 
03:51:48.309 --> 03:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
it seems to me just on its face
 
03:51:50.070 --> 03:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
that is that is
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
completely unrealistic i mean i if
 
03:51:54.150 --> 03:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
they're you know the idea that there
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:51:59.030 --> 03:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
six that only six people under the age
 
03:52:02.710 --> 03:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
of of uh of 18 would be serving some
 
03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
kind of a sentence for and you know
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
let's assume we limit it to very violent
 
03:52:08.870 --> 03:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
offenders only six
 
03:52:08.880 --> 03:52:09.830 align:start position:0%
offenders only six
wow

03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
wow
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%

03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh came to us from the house
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh it basically did a a few things in it
 
03:54:48.710 --> 03:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
it established
 
03:54:52.229 --> 03:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
a commission to study workplace
 
03:54:54.710 --> 03:54:54.720 align:start position:0%

care environments
 
03:54:59.910 --> 03:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
it set up a reporting system that
 
03:55:03.030 --> 03:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
included some confidentiality provisions
 
03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
is this what the amendment is discussing
 
03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
we touched on all of these in the
 
03:55:12.550 --> 03:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendment so so every every topic i've
 
03:55:16.710 --> 03:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
just said gets is in this amendment okay
 
03:55:18.790 --> 03:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
fine so it's not i mean
 
03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:20.239 align:start position:0%

03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:55:29.590 --> 03:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
so it came it came that way it
 
03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:30.309 align:start position:0%
so it came it came that way it
it

03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
and then it has a very simple
 
03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
over simple definition in it so
 
03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
um what we did was um we we looked at it
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
and we agreed that
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh with the hospital systems and the and
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
the nurses that workplace violence in
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
these settings uh is a very real problem
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
what we heard was that
 
03:55:59.269 --> 03:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh the hospitals and the nurses have all
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
in in some of the urgent care settings
 
03:56:04.870 --> 03:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
have have all sort of agreed finally
 
03:56:07.030 --> 03:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
after four or five years of batting us
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
around that they wanted to do something
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
so so uh so what we did was we respected
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
that with this amendment that we're
 
03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
going to um
 
03:56:18.950 --> 03:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
have these programs
 
03:56:18.960 --> 03:56:19.670 align:start position:0%
have these programs
but

03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:56:23.570 --> 03:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh rather than have them mandatory
 
03:56:23.580 --> 03:56:24.950 align:start position:0%
uh rather than have them mandatory
[Music]

03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
with a of a coercive aspect of things
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
like fines
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
we modified it to keep it still
 
03:56:35.429 --> 03:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
compulsory for their participation but
 
03:56:38.710 --> 03:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
we removed the fines in this amendment
 
03:56:38.720 --> 03:56:39.590 align:start position:0%
we removed the fines in this amendment
we

03:56:39.590 --> 03:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
went into the confidentiality part of
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
the reporting and in it we
 
03:56:47.349 --> 03:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
made sure that none of the that there
 
03:56:49.269 --> 03:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
was no protection
 
03:56:51.910 --> 03:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
for the commission when they were
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
talking about personally identifiable
 
03:56:54.239 --> 03:56:55.510 align:start position:0%
talking about personally identifiable
information

03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
um so so we kept personally identifiable
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
information out of the commission
 
03:57:01.279 --> 03:57:03.030 align:start position:0%
information out of the commission
dialogue

03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
dialogue
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
they could introduce it you know if
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
there was a police report that the
 
03:57:10.389 --> 03:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.429 --> 03:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
and we removed and from the health
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
facilities we we removed the state from
 
03:57:19.830 --> 03:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
being a compulsory member
 
03:57:22.150 --> 03:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
we did keep the
 
03:57:24.710 --> 03:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
ceo or or her
 
03:57:24.720 --> 03:57:25.910 align:start position:0%
ceo or or her
designee

03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
designee
 
03:57:27.590 --> 03:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
as a member of
 
03:57:29.910 --> 03:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
the commission itself
 
03:57:32.469 --> 03:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
so because our new hampshire
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
hospital has
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
a really
 
03:57:36.239 --> 03:57:38.229 align:start position:0%
a really
good

03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
workplace violence program that's worthy
 
03:57:42.229 --> 03:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
of emulation
 
03:57:44.550 --> 03:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
so so we're not mandating they
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
participate in the program but we are
 
03:57:50.070 --> 03:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
putting um that ceo or designee onto the
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
board so that it's easier to share and
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
so that the state has some direct
 
03:57:57.189 --> 03:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
communication with this commission
 
03:58:00.150 --> 03:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:58:00.160 --> 03:58:01.590 align:start position:0%
so um
we

03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
took the workplace violence definition
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
which originally included as as
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
workplace violence if somebody said
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
we verbally abused another person
 
03:58:17.189 --> 03:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
but the recipient
 
03:58:19.590 --> 03:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
felt absolutely no stress
 
03:58:21.670 --> 03:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
that was going to be categorized as
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
workplace violence and so we want we
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to get real numbers and so we
 
03:58:30.150 --> 03:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
split out the distinction between things
 
03:58:32.469 --> 03:58:32.479 align:start position:0%
that we would agree is workplace
 
03:58:34.150 --> 03:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
violence violence
 
03:58:36.389 --> 03:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh and from another category called
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
harsh words
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
and uh and so we want the reporting to
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
be distinct so that we we actually know
 
03:58:44.389 --> 03:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
the scope of the problem
 
03:58:47.269 --> 03:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
so so i guess uh in summary
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
um we we we retained
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
the com the kind of the compulsory
 
03:58:52.080 --> 03:58:53.110 align:start position:0%
the com the kind of the compulsory
nature

03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
nature
 
03:58:56.309 --> 03:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
of the commission and the programs
 
03:59:00.070 --> 03:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
um with the exception of exempting
 
03:59:03.189 --> 03:59:03.199 align:start position:0%
state facilities and any urgent care
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
centers that have less than three
 
03:59:08.309 --> 03:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
centers in their constellation
 
03:59:08.319 --> 03:59:11.110 align:start position:0%
centers in their constellation
we

03:59:11.110 --> 03:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
modified and i think improved the data
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
privacy aspect of the bill we removed
 
03:59:19.110 --> 03:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
the penalties and since we were removing
 
03:59:21.990 --> 03:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
a stick to use against the non-compliant
 
03:59:25.110 --> 03:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
ones we created a carrot by having the
 
03:59:27.670 --> 03:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
department maintain a website where
 
03:59:27.680 --> 03:59:29.110 align:start position:0%
department maintain a website where
everyone's

03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
everyone's
 
03:59:32.070 --> 03:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
active participation would be listed and
 
03:59:34.630 --> 03:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
that way if say
 
03:59:34.640 --> 03:59:36.070 align:start position:0%
that way if say
boondoggle

03:59:36.070 --> 03:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
boondoggle
 
03:59:36.080 --> 03:59:37.750 align:start position:0%
boondoggle
hospital

03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
should be participating and doesn't then
 
03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
there would be regular uh regular
 
03:59:44.550 --> 03:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
ability to report that they're inactive
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
or not participating and then the nurses
 
03:59:49.830 --> 03:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
and in the community can get upset at
 
03:59:51.910 --> 03:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
them instead of having the commissioner
 
03:59:53.110 --> 03:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
find them
 
03:59:55.830 --> 03:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
so um so we we voted this out at
 
03:59:57.510 --> 03:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
division three this morning it took a
 
04:00:00.150 --> 04:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
little while to get the
 
04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment put together
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
um i i think it's fair to say that both
 
04:00:07.910 --> 04:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
the nurses association and hospitals
 
04:00:07.920 --> 04:00:10.389 align:start position:0%
the nurses association and hospitals
association

04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
believe that this is an acceptable bill
 
04:00:13.910 --> 04:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
they've been trying for three or four
 
04:00:15.670 --> 04:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
years to get this going this will get it
 
04:00:15.680 --> 04:00:17.269 align:start position:0%
years to get this going this will get it
going

04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:00:19.750 --> 04:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
some of the main architecture things
 
04:00:22.469 --> 04:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
that they wanted are preserved but we we
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
softened the edges of the coercive
 
04:00:27.990 --> 04:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:00:32.229 --> 04:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
with that i'll i'll stop and take
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any are there any
 
04:00:37.030 --> 04:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
other comments questions
 
04:00:39.670 --> 04:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative lin yes um uh thank you
 
04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you representatives for taking
 
04:00:43.750 --> 04:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
my question i i was uh
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
in for at least part of the division
 
04:00:47.510 --> 04:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
three hearing on this because i was
 
04:00:49.510 --> 04:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for 458
 
04:00:50.870 --> 04:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday or the day before whenever it
 
04:00:50.880 --> 04:00:51.670 align:start position:0%
yesterday or the day before whenever it
was

04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
and you um raised a number of questions
 
04:00:57.830 --> 04:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
to witnesses at the at the hearing
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
about as i understood it anyway about
 
04:01:00.080 --> 04:01:00.870 align:start position:0%
about as i understood it anyway about
why

04:01:00.870 --> 04:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
was it necessary to have
 
04:01:05.349 --> 04:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
to have this be other than completely
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary and and i thought those were
 
04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
very good questions and i'm not sure i
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
really heard particularly good answers
 
04:01:14.309 --> 04:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
from the witnesses um and so i guess i
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
would pose the question again why all of
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
this sounds like it's very it's it's
 
04:01:19.830 --> 04:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
very important and a very good thing to
 
04:01:19.840 --> 04:01:20.710 align:start position:0%
very important and a very good thing to
happen

04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:01:20.720 --> 04:01:21.670 align:start position:0%
happen
but

04:01:21.670 --> 04:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
why can't uh hospitals just do it on
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
i i think that's an excellent question i
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
don't think i heard really an adequate
 
04:01:33.030 --> 04:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
answer to the question but to be fair to
 
04:01:34.469 --> 04:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
the process and the people who
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
participated in it
 
04:01:39.189 --> 04:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh i i it's it's really important that
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
this program get established
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
they they the the the nurses the work
 
04:01:46.309 --> 04:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
staff they're really crying out that
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
they want this program it's been three
 
04:01:50.630 --> 04:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
or four years of trying to get it going
 
04:01:52.630 --> 04:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
without success
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
it it it it's it's it's the process of
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
having this legislation that is really
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
puts the stake in the ground that it
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
shall happen
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i
 
04:02:05.990 --> 04:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
think that as a philosophical matter if
 
04:02:08.229 --> 04:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
they all really want to do it it could
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
be more voluntary than what we left it
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
i i made
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
some trade-off decisions as in the
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
drafting of this
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and leave
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
the compulsory nature of the commission
 
04:02:23.830 --> 04:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
and the program in place
 
04:02:27.030 --> 04:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
but removing the active penalties other
 
04:02:29.110 --> 04:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
than what could be brought to bear by
 
04:02:30.790 --> 04:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
community pressure through the use of
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
the website
 
04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:02:35.830 --> 04:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
to that it's more compulsory than i'm
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with but uh but i think when
 
04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
you're making sausage
 
04:02:45.670 --> 04:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is a reasonable accommodation
 
04:02:47.269 --> 04:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions uh
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.510 --> 04:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i believe
 
04:02:55.510 --> 04:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative norgren has had her hand
 
04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
up so i'll give you her
 
04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative yeah no i just
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to compliment the chair in
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
division three in particular i think
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
this was a scary process that we started
 
04:03:10.150 --> 04:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
on i think the hospital association a
 
04:03:11.429 --> 04:03:11.439 align:start position:0%
lot of those
 
04:03:11.439 --> 04:03:12.229 align:start position:0%
lot of those
uh

04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were worried what we were
 
04:03:16.550 --> 04:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
going to come up with but in the end the
 
04:03:19.030 --> 04:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
hospital association and the people some
 
04:03:21.429 --> 04:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
of them who were in the audience today
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
agreed with it i think
 
04:03:24.870 --> 04:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
04:03:26.950 --> 04:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
the primary issue i think was the
 
04:03:30.150 --> 04:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
agreement on making it mandatory and not
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
voluntary because we felt if one
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
hospital dropped out then it wasn't a
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%
worthwhile process
 
04:03:39.510 --> 04:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
but i think the product we ended up with
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
was agreeable to all parties which i
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
think was a huge accomplishment
 
04:03:47.030 --> 04:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mooney
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair at one point this
 
04:03:52.070 --> 04:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill had a warrantless arrest provision
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
i just want to confirm that is still no
 
04:03:56.150 --> 04:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
longer part of your amendment you're
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
introducing today so so
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
just to back up a little bit
 
04:04:03.910 --> 04:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
the warrantless arrest component of this
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
was removed by hhs in the house before
 
04:04:09.590 --> 04:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
it came to us there was no appetite for
 
04:04:11.510 --> 04:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
adding it back because
 
04:04:13.110 --> 04:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
the belief i think of the house and
 
04:04:13.120 --> 04:04:15.349 align:start position:0%
the belief i think of the house and
certainly

04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:04:17.590 --> 04:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
most of the division three my guess is
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
if if there are issues with warrantless
 
04:04:24.309 --> 04:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
arrests in new hampshire it's bigger
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
than the hospital system and so it
 
04:04:28.870 --> 04:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
really ought to be addressed as a more
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
comprehensive thing by the criminal
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
justice or judiciary and not by hhs so
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
we did not attempt to bring that back in
 
04:04:40.870 --> 04:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte thank you madam
 
04:04:42.389 --> 04:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
chair i'm going to echo a little bit of
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
what representative lin asked and that
 
04:04:44.960 --> 04:04:45.750 align:start position:0%
what representative lin asked and that
is

04:04:45.750 --> 04:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm baffled by the the mandatory
 
04:04:51.189 --> 04:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
uh nature of the bill
 
04:04:51.199 --> 04:04:52.070 align:start position:0%
uh nature of the bill
uh

04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
the hospital association of course i
 
04:04:55.590 --> 04:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the hearings but the if the
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
hospital association the nurse
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
association and everybody involved is in
 
04:05:02.309 --> 04:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
favor of this my question would be why
 
04:05:05.110 --> 04:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't anything been done over the last
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
three four years or whatever the time
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
frame um i
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
i think making this a mandatory
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
with all the reporting requirements and
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
everything that goes along with us i i
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
think it just for me it goes a little
 
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
bit too far thank you madam sure
 
04:05:24.150 --> 04:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
would someone like to answer that
 
04:05:24.160 --> 04:05:25.750 align:start position:0%
would someone like to answer that
question

04:05:25.750 --> 04:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:05:27.670 --> 04:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
well representative edwards
 
04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:05:32.950 --> 04:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
our health care system has been under
 
04:05:35.590 --> 04:05:35.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous stress in the last couple of
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
three years and so
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and i i wouldn't be surprised if the
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
very things that were stressing the
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
health care system and distracting the
 
04:05:47.510 --> 04:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
executives and others
 
04:05:47.520 --> 04:05:48.389 align:start position:0%
executives and others
uh

04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
also was contributing to an increase in
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
violence right
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
so um so we did put a repeal in this at
 
04:05:59.990 --> 04:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
10 years um so that if if this bill
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
isn't really necessary it'll age itself
 
04:06:02.880 --> 04:06:03.750 align:start position:0%
isn't really necessary it'll age itself
out

04:06:03.750 --> 04:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:06:03.760 --> 04:06:04.550 align:start position:0%
out
um

04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
so why didn't the health care system
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
take care of this i think maybe because
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's hard to organize a bunch of cats
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
and get them to agree to things and and
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
if nothing else by putting it into a law
 
04:06:22.630 --> 04:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
into a framework there's something that
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
all of them could look at instead of
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
constantly wrestling with each other on
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
different perspectives of what it should
 
04:06:32.150 --> 04:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
look like this at least gives them that
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
framework could it have been voluntary i
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
believe it could have been but
 
04:06:39.189 --> 04:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
it you know at the end of the day i i
 
04:06:41.349 --> 04:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we came up with
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
a program and a commission
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
um and and we can revise and extend this
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislation based on our experience we
 
04:06:50.790 --> 04:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's in the
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
amendment i should maybe should have
 
04:06:54.790 --> 04:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned was we introduced the fact
 
04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
that the commission has a reporting
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
relationship with
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
the joint
 
04:06:59.840 --> 04:07:02.309 align:start position:0%
the joint
um

04:07:02.309 --> 04:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
i'm on the darn thing the joint uh hhs
 
04:07:07.189 --> 04:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
04:07:08.710 --> 04:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
it had been
 
04:07:10.710 --> 04:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
could only act to make changes in the
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
program or in the law
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
if she had the cons advice and consent
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
of the commission
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
so we stripped out the consent part
 
04:07:25.349 --> 04:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
and we inserted um
 
04:07:29.110 --> 04:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
hhs so we should be getting the annual
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
reports we should be able to monitor
 
04:07:31.199 --> 04:07:32.070 align:start position:0%
reports we should be able to monitor
this

04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:07:32.080 --> 04:07:33.189 align:start position:0%
this
um

04:07:33.189 --> 04:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
if if
 
04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
if the law needs to change we can change
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
it but this was let's at least get the
 
04:07:41.110 --> 04:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
canoe in the water and let people start
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
