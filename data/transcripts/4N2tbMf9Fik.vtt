morning good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I hope this is
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
an easy one for you it deals with our
 
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
cover plates the State Rep
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
plates um I actually brought this bill
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
forward a few years back and I was told
 
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
then by the director that we didn't need
 
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
it it was already the way that you could
 
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
do it and what I'm looking to do is put
 
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
my State Rep plate on the front my
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
regular plate stays on the back and um
 
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
he said I could do it I asked him for a
 
00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 align:start position:0%
letter he never gave me one and then
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
shortly after I had a discussion with a
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
State Trooper on the side of the highway
 
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
about that deal and he said no I went to
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
Division of Motor Vehicles they said
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
nope you can't do that so I would really
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
like to be able to swap
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
them um it's not like I'm hiding
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
anything if you uh run either one of
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
those plates they come back to me and my
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
car so
 
00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:29.990 align:start position:0%
car so

um
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
for me I just really want that plate on
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
so I can get into the garage on session
 
00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 align:start position:0%
days and you know every once in a while
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
I might do something stupid and I don't
 
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 align:start position:0%
need to let everybody know who I am and
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%

committee seeing n oh hold on represent
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you Mr chairman so just so I
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
understand the reason you want this is
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
only for the purpose of getting in and
 
00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
garage what would you have your
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
legislative plate on the front is that's
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
correct your regular plate on the back I
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
prefer to have my legislative plate on
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
the front so if I need it from something
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
else maybe parking around you know
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
running in to the state house to pick up
 
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
a bill or something it identifies that
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a State Rep and
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
I just prefer to have that in the front
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
and my regular plate in the back I have
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
a nice
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
plate uh so I like to show it off don't
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
want to hide it for two
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
years thank you any further
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
C thank you for taking a question would
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
there be any preferences to which one
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
goes on the front and which on the back
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
would would you see any variation I I
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
believe people would probably do a
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
variation and I want to leave that open
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
to the person with the plates so I know
 
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put mine in my rep plate in
 
00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
the front and leave my regular plate in
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
the back I'm not sure what other people
 
00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
would like to do but I
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
think they come back to us so whatever
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
combination I I think is up to
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
them any other
 
00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
questions wow represent of rumo who
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
question I'm just wondering if you got
 
00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:35.639 align:start position:0%
any feedback if any sort of
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
administrative confusion or how this
 
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
would work in terms of so you did run
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
into office and were parked and got a
 
00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
ticket for some reason being not in a
 
00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
designated spot you know which plate
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to run or if it's through
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know through the computer system
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
through their app I mean so as far as I
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
know uh they both are in the computer
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
system they both come back to me and by
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
law I have to have my regular plates
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
either on the vehicle or in the
 
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle so that if there ever is a
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
question they can go right back to my
 
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.629 align:start position:0%
question they can go right back to my
regular

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%

Speaker got a promotion Mr chairman I'm
 
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
sorry can um can I I I don't know if
 
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.120 align:start position:0%

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
this is for you but when you uh when you
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
go into the parking lot legislative
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
parking lot and there's the security
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
guard out there is he checking your
 
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
plate or is he looking to see if you
 
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
have that green sticker on your
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
windshield I thought that's what the
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
sticker was for but they also do
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
recognize the plates I mean we we're the
 
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
only ones that get them uh that's the
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
best I can answer your question we'd
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
have to talk with them personally thank
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
you because to be honest with you uh I
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
have never put a decal on my vehicle I
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
rely on the plates
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
so anybody else from the committee all
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
right seeing that thank you very
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
Hill would there be any reason to have
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
that um on the front of your plate for
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
things like uh the um fast pass lane or
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
something like that could be yeah
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
because that's what they look at when we
 
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
go through if you don't have an easy
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
pass because I don't think every member
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
has an Easy Pass anymore so would would
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
you be amendable to an amendment that
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
required um to work it the way you
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
currently would like to to have the sure
 
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
I just try to in be all inclusive you
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
know Kindler gentler and all that and uh
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
so whatever you people
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee decides is fine as long as I
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
can have my plate on the front I'll be
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
have it built in if a police officer
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
were to pull you over they wouldn't
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
plate at one time they were actually
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
embossing the registration and filling
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
all the information on the Reg
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
registrations are they but since Co I
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't think they're doing that anymore
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
are they we are not we just have a form
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
and it's up to you to put it in your
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
vehicle where you want whatever vehicle
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
you want it into so we don't we've never
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
had it in our system we've always
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
maintained a
 
00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:14.710 align:start position:0%
maintained a
spreadsheet

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
okay what about the
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
tolls what what if if somebody's running
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
to me it doesn't matter you can either
 
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
run one cover plate on the front or two
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
what if the tolls how does the tolls
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
recognize that do you know I know it's
 
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
not your department um honestly I don't
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.189 --> 00:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
works fair enough any other
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
questions just an observation we have
 
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
available the uh the toll transponders
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
in the orange container the yeah but not
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
everybody's got a transponder if you
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
were to go through the tolls and they
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
had a question they would reach out to
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
us and we'd look on our spreadsheet to
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
see who had that house plate and who it
 
00:12:59.069 --> 00:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
belongs to okay uh again I know called
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
you um uh without notice U does the
 
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
department have an opinion either way we
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't have an opinion either way thank
 
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:09.560 align:start position:0%

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%

survivorship uh I won't go through my
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
normal disclosures because there's
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
nobody here in the room it appears to to
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
speak to it um chair recognizes the
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill representative
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hill good morning Mr chairman thank you
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
um for the record I am representative
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
Greg Hill I represent Northfield um
 
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
which is marrat 2
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
I'm here um actually at the request of a
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
constituent from Northfield uh who was a
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
Survivor um and had veterans plates um
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
that meant a great deal to she and her
 
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.710 align:start position:0%
that meant a great deal to she and her
husband

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
husband
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
um at the death of the
 
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.590 align:start position:0%
um at the death of the
spouse

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
spouse
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
um she was told that she could continue
 
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
the registration I think for eight 18
 
00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
months or one additional time and then
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
she was required to um give up the
 
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
plates and um re-register or retitled
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
the the vehicle um we
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
inquired um if there was a if that was
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
an optional um item for that she
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to if she was keeping
 
00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
everything the same and uh and we were
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
told no um there the DMV is not in the
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
business of of titling vehicles to dead
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
people so um the question is why uh what
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
what difference would it make if this
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
was uh done in in terms of a right of
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
survivorship anyway it was registered
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
that way with both she and her husband
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
on there
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
um why wouldn't it be possible for her
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
to just keep uh the the titling the same
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
and not have to retitle the vehicle and
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
um and just uh change the inspection
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
date to her birthday and have everything
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
move along as it as it would um the only
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
requirement would be upon sale or
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
trading in the vehicle or something of
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
those nature she would uh she would
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
provide um the death certificate
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
and uh and that seemed like it would
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
solve every issue and it wouldn't mean
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
that someone would have to go to the
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
extra step um
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
needlessly I have a feeling since I
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
filed this i' I've had a new an well at
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
least uh a full handful of people say
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
yeah the same thing happened to me um or
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
to my mother-in-law or my something um
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
so I think it's more common than than we
 
00:23:33.149 --> 00:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
may think um but I have no no way of
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
knowing um it just seemed that this
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
would be a good way to get the answer to
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
the question why why we have to make
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
someone um do an extra step when there
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
really is no benefit to it and with that
 
00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'll end my
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you sir any questions
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
correct and without taking a position on
 
00:24:07.919 --> 00:24:12.870 align:start position:0%
correct and without taking a position on
the

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
bill good morning chairman and members
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jennifer o
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
I'm the title bureau administrator with
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
the Division of Motor Vehicles I have
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
been with the division Motor Vehicles
 
00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
for 20 years focusing mainly on the
 
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle side of the division which would
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
be both registration en title with me I
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
have Kathleen Diamond again the
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
assistant supervisor of
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
registrations um we wanted to just kind
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
of fill in some of the gaps and let you
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
guys understand why uh we do have a
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
deceased individual removed from a title
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
in a registration so an individual who
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
is no longer with us being listed on a
 
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
registration or a title does open up for
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
certain areas of fraud uh for other
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
people to be able to put their names on
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
on registrations and titles and maintain
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
um ownership of vehicle for an
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
individual that is no longer with us
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
does open up for uh for some areas of
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
fraud in addition to that with the
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
veterans plates it's not us that sets a
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
standard for the veterans plate it's
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
actually the um Veterans Affairs that
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
sets the guidelines for who's qualified
 
00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559 align:start position:0%
to have um certain veterans plates on
 
00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
their vehicles so in this case if you
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
are are if you have a disabled veteran
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
plate on your vehicle and um you are
 
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
deceased then nobody else can carry that
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
on because they're not the individual
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
that has the uh disability that is uh
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
service I'm not as where I'll end that
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
right thank you any questions from the
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative sellers thank
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so you're saying open is up
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
to fraud can you explain how yes great
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
great question thank you for that so an
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
individual who is no longer with us uh
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
cannot sign for ownership and um the
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse can only remove their
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
name can't actually add their name
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the legal authority to add
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
a deceased individual's name so then
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
being able to continue registrations is
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
going to show proof of ownership it also
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
shows who is with us and who is not uh
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
walking disability privileges are also
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
related to documents that are coming out
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
of our system um so in order for us to
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
monitor that we also go by the documents
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
that are in there and current and active
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
status any other questions represent
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
C thank you for taking my question um
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
the question I have is if this were
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
enacted uh what might you see as being a
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
problem if the surviving spouse then
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
remarried thank you for your question I
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
think as it relates to registrations I'm
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to understand am I understanding
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
your question that it relates directly
 
00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:06.470 align:start position:0%
your question that it relates directly
to

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
registrations well and or the title and
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
or the title so um from the title aspect
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
it would have no bearing if the
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
individual uh remarries there's no
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
privileges associated with that if the
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
surviving spouse were to want to sign
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
ownership over partial ownership over to
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
their new partner then um just a proper
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
assignment on the back with a copy of
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
the death certificate would take
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
place as for registration I'll turn it
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
over to you thank you so for
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
registration in order to register the
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
vehicle the title in the registration
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
must match so if they were to sign over
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
to their new spouse we would have to um
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
adjust the registration to reflect that
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
change and if I may want add a followup
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
to that many registrations do not speak
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
to who the owner is so if if I were to
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
have a special number plate say a
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
four-digit passenger plate my surviving
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
spouse would be entitled to that they
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
would be the first person entitled to
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
that so they would for No Charge um
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
complete a transfer of ownership on a
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
title which is just the title itself and
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
a copy of the death certificate which
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
they can do strictly right at their town
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and then they would be
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
able to inherit that plate they would
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
also be able to add additional family
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
members onto that plate if they were
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
adding it on to the title if you adding
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
an additional family member um onto the
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
title there is a charge to retitle it uh
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
however those plates they would be
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to maintain it's just certain
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
veteran statuses that they would not be
 
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.430 align:start position:0%
veteran statuses that they would not be
able

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you for answering
 
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:48.519 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I thought the bill was a nice
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
sentimental Bill uh and you've shown us
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
the obstacles but is there a different
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
way is there route we can go to make
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
this happen that doesn't upset the whole
 
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.350 align:start position:0%
this happen that doesn't upset the whole
apple

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
apple
 
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
cart thank you for your question you
 
00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
bring up a very good point this is you
 
00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
know talking about sentimental wanting
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
to maintain your status uh being proud
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
of your spouse who is a veteran and
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
serve for our country completely
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
understand that I think that further
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
discussion would need to take place
 
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
where we could kind of look at what laws
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
and rules this would impact and if there
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
are other agencies that would have a
 
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:27.799 align:start position:0%
stake in this I think that that would be
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
worth it thank you so
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
much representative sellers thank you Mr
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh I just want to bring up we do
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
have a house bill 1354 where we will be
 
00:29:39.789 --> 00:29:39.799 align:start position:0%
looking at which has to deal with
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
veterans plates and survivors of
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
veterans basally almost the same idea so
 
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
I just want to bring up that fact and um
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
I on this bill here though I'm thinking
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
here is usually when someone there
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
someone has the Survivor a deceased
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
person um yeah it's you know again
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
they're going through a lot of different
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
things at that time is there a way that
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
we could actually say look we we can
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
give you the new title without cost or
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
trying to make their life easier somehow
 
00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:14.919 align:start position:0%
is that absolutely thank you for your
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
question and you bring up a lot of great
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
points our current statutes allow for
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
our surviving spouse to take up to 13
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
months at no charge to come in and
 
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
retitle their vehicles so it's not
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
something that's Ed while they're
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
dealing with all of the other stuff that
 
00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
comes along with losing a loved one in
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
addition to that um there are
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
permissions that allow for registration
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
to be maintained for one year or up to
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
up to one year or date of expiration so
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
again they wouldn't have to take care of
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
that so if I were to pass away my
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
registration expires in September my
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
husband would have rights to that
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle through September of next year
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
or sorry this year um and wouldn't have
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
to take care of it until then so that is
 
00:31:01.389 --> 00:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't have to be high
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
on the priority list when they're
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with everything else that
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
they're going through and as I said if
 
00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
it's a surviving spouse just retitling
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
it in their name there is no charge it's
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
just a photocopy of the death
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
certificate and then the title with them
 
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
requirement represent coka thank you Mr
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so just so I understand it
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
when they retitle it um as far as vanity
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
plates are concerned they they have
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
first I guess dibs on the vanity plates
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
that is correct I do all right on this
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
instant um because I actually walked
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
with the woman that brought this bill up
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
her plate was a disabled veteran plate
 
00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:42.679 align:start position:0%
and she didn't qualify for that if she
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
had qualified if she was a disabled
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
veteran herself she would have been able
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
to keep that plate um so what we were
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
able to do for her is get her a veteran
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
plate with that number and that seemed
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
to make her happy because it was very
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
sentimental that number to her okay yeah
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's what I was just want to make sure
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
I understood it correctly thank you
 
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome any further questions
 
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
committee I only have one yeah you
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
stated that it was the State Department
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
of Veterans Affairs that basically
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
dictates how long a surviving spouse can
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
maintain that plate um is that in
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
statute the Veterans Affairs determines
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
who has eligibility and qualifies for
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
those plates um the maintaining any
 
00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
plate for one year or up until um Reg
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
ation is determined by the Division of
 
00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles and those are in statute
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
and Rule and we can get those over to
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%

00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
be at 10:40 I'll open up the public
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
1122 relative to lights on motor
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles and the chair recognizes uh
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative Tom
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
Walsh thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
Tom Walsh I'm a represented from the
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
town of hookit Dunbarton which is
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
meramac 10 I'm here to introduce House
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 1122 FN relative to lights on motor
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles uh I I uh met with the
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles and
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
department of safety Last Summer uh they
 
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
had some concerns about some of the
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
lighting on vehicles in the state um
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
among them are the color of the lights
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
and when lights are being used by your
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
ride share companies Uber being Blue by
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
the way uh and some of the aftermarket
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
lights headlights some of these things
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
have Halos um so we have a lot of
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
aftermarket products that are being used
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
and then they've got some legitimate
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
concerns also uh you might notice a lot
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
of people using on their trucks these
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
new LED light bues which are very very
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
bright so after a long meeting with them
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up conversation I agreed
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
with everything they said they've got
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
some legitimate concerns so I put the
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
bill in for them so I will defer to the
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
details and specifications to the
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety uh and thank you
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
very much and that's how you do it
 
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:55.230 align:start position:0%
very much and that's how you do it
representative

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
C thank you so much representative for
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony any
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
stclair would this would this uh also
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
apply to motorcycles that like to ride
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
around with the lights on the bottom of
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
their motorcycles that project green red
 
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
blue blue
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
yellow so it's not a headlight it's the
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
you know you know what I'm talking about
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
the lights that thank you I didn't see
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
anything about motorcycles specifically
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
in here but I know the colored lamps are
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
um a topic so I'll have to look into
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
that deeper or the question might be
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
better serve to the Department of
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
Safety I do know we did pass a a year or
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
two ago allowing for three lights on the
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
front of a motorcycle versus the two
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
four some of these aftermarket lights uh
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
but that didn't come up in the
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had over the summer
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up thank
 
00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
you when I have these vehicles behind me
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking a
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
motorcycle you see the headlights but
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
you also see these other lights because
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
they're bright they're low to the ground
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
so they do catch your attention and
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm talking about so you
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
understand you understand what I'm
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
talking about not just headlights okay
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you don't see that as a
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
problem okay thank you I don't see them
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
offer any other questions representative
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
V thank you uh just a quick one uh does
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on light bars affect
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
work Vehicles such as private plow
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
trucks that might need to use a light on
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
text I believe it does it's it does not
 
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
spell out that it's it's it's
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles
 
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
only I'm looking at actually line 10 on
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
page two uh or might be actually
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
starting on page eight um it's General
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
it's not specific to either residential
 
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
commercial any other questions from the
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
you chair now like to recog izes Dan
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
Bennett who's asking for three minutes
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
the committee uh good morning and I will
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
be brief uh Dan Bennett Hampshire Auto
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
Dealers Association we're our trade
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
Association representing the motor
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle industry um so I'm here today uh
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our inspection stations um
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
to give you a little bit of Industry
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
perspective Ive on chairman Walsh's bill
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
which as mentioned NH does support um
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
the industry perspective is that these
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
couple changes to the inspection law are
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
common sense uh problem was identified
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
by DMV um and the fix was suggested and
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
we think it's a good one um to
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair's question uh
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
yeah importantly section two does treat
 
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.240 align:start position:0%
motorcycles equitably it affects cars
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
and motorcycles as far as lamp covering
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
um and we did touch auxiliary lamping
 
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
two sessions ago allowing for four uh
 
00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
four forward-facing um auxiliary lamps
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
the LED bar um to represent V's question
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
is an interesting one um we do support
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
it um because it's not requiring capping
 
00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
in a lot of auxiliary lamping sometimes
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
you see capping required uh this one
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
makes it a capping can sometimes come at
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
a cost so this just uh says that they
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
can't be illuminated when on way um
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
there is I guess a bit of a technical
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
question there because my driveway if
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
open to the public can actually be
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
considered a public way like a retail
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
veh car dealer's lot is considered a
 
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
public way because the public can access
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
it but it comes to a Law Enforcement
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
issue where LED light bars are most
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
popular is in plow trucks um on on roofs
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh on plow accessory kits um I'm highly
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
um doubt that law enforcement would
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
enforce a ticket of a moving motor
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
violation for illuminated LED lamp bars
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
when someone was plowing a parking lot
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
for safety so um although it could be a
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
tech Calia really in the reality is we
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
don't see it being enforced um but it's
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
a it's the whole bill in itself they
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
they're Common Sense changes um designed
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
with um really roadway safety in mind
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
for those that are traveling in on the
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
roads um you know oddly colored lights
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
distracting colored lights um lights
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
that are too bright um have some real
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
safety issues and this bill addresses
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
that um and as a result as mentioned we
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support it so um I'll
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there are
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
any thank you so much any questions from
 
00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
the committee representative St Clair
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
thank you can you explain to me lights
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
that are too bright could you be more
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
specific about
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
that uh I'll do my best representative
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question so lights are um
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
are rated and the inspection law
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
indicates how bright they can be
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's uh it used to be candle
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
power uh however that's that's pretty
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
dated right so I believe they switch to
 
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
lumens um which is the light output just
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
like you would find for uh a a home or
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
or a fluorescent lamp vehicle headlights
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
have Lumin ratings too if it's too
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
bright and it's in an oncoming Lane at
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
you it can be blinding just like someone
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
driving by with their um with their
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
brights on uh so lights have a um a a
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
cap or a maximum output of lumens that
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
have thank
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
you chair would now like to recognize
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
our Carl hudston from The New Hampshire
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety who's requesting
 
00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill good morning Mr chairman and
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to my right is
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
AI supervisor Ken quit um I have some
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks and uh then we can take
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
some questions if you'd like if anybody
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
has any uh the bill addresses equipment
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturing within the automotive
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
industry um protecting the Public's
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
ability to see while driving at night
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
and understanding uh the colored lights
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
on a vehicle as you know uh New
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law allows for colored lights
 
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
on specific uh types of vehicles most
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
colors such as red blue Amber are
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
immediately recognized in most instances
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
as emergency vehicles headlamps and or
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
halo lights and as as explained before
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
the Halo or the circular lights around
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
the headlight uh can be purchased in
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
Many Colors some of them change um as
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're on I've seen that uh some
 
00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers include this type of
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
lighting lighting as an option when you
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
purchase the vehicle white and Amber
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
lighting are naturally recognized as
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
color colors that illuminate the front
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
of a vehicle and
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
conversely red and blue are are in the
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
rear when mod when modifications are
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
made to these colors it can be confusing
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
to motorist as they may not be able to
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
recognize the orientation of a vehicle
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
or the type of vehicle um that they
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
see um another example would be uh the
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
ride share as was mentioned
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
before um they're becoming um
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
increasingly popular often time these
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
lights can be observed mounted in the
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
interior of the windshield uh of the
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
participating vehicle depending on the
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
placement and the color of the light uh
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
driver may be under the misunderstanding
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
that it's an emergency vehicle uh the
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
practice of leaving uh that type of
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
light Illuminator would while driving is
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
not necessary and obviously can confuse
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
other motorists uh advances made in the
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
automotive uh lighting have provided a
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
variety of auxiliary lighting options to
 
00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle owners the customization of both
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
on and off-road vehicle lighting um has
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
prevented uh some challenges in the
 
00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement and can put the the public
 
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559 align:start position:0%
at risk by blinding them and I can
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
attest to um that uh consequently the
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to focus on the operation of
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
the lighting in place of actually
 
00:50:42.789 --> 00:50:42.799 align:start position:0%
restricting the equipment on the
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles themselves and one of the
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
questions that was
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
raised um was about uh emergency
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
lighting on the roof uh New Hampshire uh
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
has an RSA that talks about emergency
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
lighting separately from this so it
 
00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
identifies what type of lighting can be
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
used for what type of operation
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
obviously law enforcement is blue fire
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
department is red and um you know road
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
work Department of Public Works Are all
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh amber so I know somebody had asked a
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
question about that so separate law
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
identifies what colors can be used and
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
to speak to um the question about um
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
using this auxiliary
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
equipment while plowing a a parking lot
 
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:33.799 align:start position:0%
or something like that yeah on the law
 
00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of this no if they're
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
off the the the main public way and he
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
is right um a parking lot of a of a
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
business is technically a public we this
 
00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
is focused on the actual Road not
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
somebody's large parking lot so uh just
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're not going down
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
that road um as a law enforcement
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
um side of this I can't imagine anybody
 
00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.470 align:start position:0%
um side of this I can't imagine anybody
would

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
ever pursue
 
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.670 align:start position:0%
ever pursue
that

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't happy to answer any
 
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
the committee representative St
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
Clair good morning and thank you sure so
 
00:52:21.789 --> 00:52:21.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going go back to motorcycles okay
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
one of the question for
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
motorcyclist riding at night
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
is is is a high rate of risk that so a
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the motorcyclists have now added
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
if they have um crash bars in the
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
front or if they have something they can
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
mount on their front fender they'll put
 
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
some lights on those and they're
 
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
bright um normally the smart motorcycles
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
will have a dimmer on there just like
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
our regular headlights and will dim it
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
to oncoming traffic but with those
 
00:52:54.799 --> 00:52:56.470 align:start position:0%
to oncoming traffic but with those
lights

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
lights
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
by themselves being added would that
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
cause an inspection failure or would
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
they be illegal I mean would there be a
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
limit if I want to put five on each side
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
again to Bright brighten up that roadway
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
ahead of me at night or was on a rainy
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
night especially would that become
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
illegal under this
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question so on
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
the inspection side of this it wouldn't
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
um it's not the inspection the motor
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle inspection um only f focuses on
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
required lighting and required equipment
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh if for whatever reason somebody
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
brought a motorcycle in like that that
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
had a blue or a red cover on the front
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
of it obviously that would fail um but
 
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
no uh the inspection focuses on on the
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
required equipment so on line one of the
 
00:53:48.069 --> 00:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
second page of the bill it talks about
 
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
headlight sou shine white when shined
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
against a white surface all other
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
forward facing light shall be Amber or
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
white so
 
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
that eliminates any of those other
 
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
colors on any lights on the front of the
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle um and for inspection purposes
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
on the motorcycle they they are allowed
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
to have four forward- facing auxiliary
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
lights on
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
that follow up yes please thank you now
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
I have not seen this enforced in a long
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
time but the Blue Dot on the tail light
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah now in the in the bad old days
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
I call them that would be probable cars
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
to be pulled over correct because you
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
had this which was standed back in the
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
old days that blue dot on the tail light
 
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
would that be is that going to be a
 
00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.630 align:start position:0%
would that be is that going to be a
problem

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
again I don't think that it's a problem
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
now I don't think that's an issue
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on the tail lights um the
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
main portion of the tail light is red um
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's actually doesn't turn it blue it
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
actually turns it purple um it's not
 
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
going to be affect the inspection
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
portion of that no okay thank thank you
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
very much any other questions from the
 
00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:08.839 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you very much um thank you
 
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:15.280 align:start position:0%
for being here uh in many of the smaller
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
communities that have volunteer fire
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
departments the firefighters actually
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
have light sometimes have light bars
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
right on their own personal vehicles and
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
I guess the reason is because they're
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
not responding to a fire from the
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
station they're responding from their
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
home to the fire station um what what is
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
the law with that is I I've seen them in
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
red I've seen them in
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
blue thank you for the question um just
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
you know I I am a call firefighter as
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
well so I'm quite familiar with this so
 
00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:48.200 align:start position:0%
again the state has a specific law that
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
talks about colors for specific
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
operations yes fire department
 
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
operations are listed as red so this
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
this first of all would not affect us at
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
all it's actually um it's called
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
emergency lighting so it does not this
 
00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
bill does not have any effect on that at
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
all um the the law that talks about
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
emergency lighting
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
says again blue is police red is fire
 
00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
Amber is for everything
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
else and
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.430 align:start position:0%
else and
um

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:26.589 --> 00:56:26.599 align:start position:0%
this this particular Bill wouldn't
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
affect that at
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
so it can still be considered emergency
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
lighting even if it's on a private
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
vehicle correct so yes that answers my
 
00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:43.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
sure representative foot thank you Mr
 
00:56:52.029 --> 00:56:52.039 align:start position:0%
chair um on page one lines 22 and 23
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
every lamp bul or light used in any
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
headlamp shall be such candle power is
 
00:56:58.190 --> 00:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
specified by the pro device
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
so what is too bright ver and is our a
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
way you to be tested like is
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
something so um my understanding is that
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
any any light um that you
 
00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:16.839 align:start position:0%
purchase you can find the actual lumens
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
that it puts out if you care to
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
um the state does have a standard I
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
don't know it off the top of my head
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
okay so is there is there sorry Mr chair
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
follow follow up so is there a way if
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
someone would be a vehicle would be
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
pulled over is there a way that the
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
officer would be able to test on the
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
roadside if that vehicle lamp is too
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
bright based on just opinion or is there
 
00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.349 align:start position:0%
bright based on just opinion or is there
an

00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
actual tool they
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
used there tool there there is a tool
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
however we don't carry it road side um
 
00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that um can be
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
done and I know one of the in some
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
testimony I believe last week it talked
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
about a forced inspection if we stop
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
something roadside we can have it towed
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
in have a a an authorized inspection
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
station do a forced inspection uh to
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
address a certain area that I believe is
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
something that you could use in that
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
type of an instance or again doing some
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up information getting the
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
information on the light itself and
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
following up that way but there is a
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
method however roadside would be very
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
hard to do
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you Mr
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um trooper I just want to make
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
clear in my own mind that um I'm not
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
exactly sure if it was last year the
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
year before we changed the uh red light
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
blue light law to reflect that fire
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
department could have a a blue light on
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
their ambulances and fire trucks I want
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
to confirm that this law does not it's
 
00:59:04.109 --> 00:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
being authorized under one section of
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
the law I want to make sure it does not
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
impact that change for emergency
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
Personnel thank you for the question
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
that is correct U this this is this
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill is is addressing the
 
00:59:20.349 --> 00:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
headlights yes um the the law was
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
changed a couple years ago uh to reflect
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh the NFPA standard for lighting on
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
emergency apparatus so this would not
 
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:30.870 align:start position:0%
emergency apparatus so this would not
affect

00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
that I have a actually question for you
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
you mentioned in your testimony about
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
the headlamps that can change
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
colors is that relatively do does that
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
happen on newer Vehicles when I say
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
newer like newer model
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
vehicles so what I was referring to was
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
the actual Halo itself not the headlight
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
itself um there are some Led Halos that
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
will change color um I don't know how
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's Pro it's it's programmable because
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
the LEDs have a number of different
 
01:00:05.549 --> 01:00:05.559 align:start position:0%
colors that can be emitted from them so
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I've seen them uh they change from
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
Orange to red to blue and everything
 
01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:12.520 align:start position:0%
like that so um I can answer that
 
01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:15.039 align:start position:0%
question okay so I did some research and
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
I uh posed several manufacturers that do
 
01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
have the halo lights um and every
 
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that does have a Halo are
 
01:00:25.349 --> 01:00:25.359 align:start position:0%
not programmed able and they're not
 
01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
changeable they are only to be Amber
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
facing forward if they do change color
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
it's an aftermarket light and that's
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
what this is trying to prohibit the
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
aftermarket light is programmable with a
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
remote control you can do it at any time
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
while you're driving um I don't believe
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill is going to affect it if
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is parked sitting at a car
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
show or that type of thing but if you're
 
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
driving down the road or you're using
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
the vehicle Upon A Way
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's not to be changed it's supposed to
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
be one color it's supposed to be Amber
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer recommended color so I
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
guess that's my next question is can
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
these be
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
retrofitted to older cars yes yes they
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
do actually do make them for many makes
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
of vehicles older ones new ones all of
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
them you can
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
actually Amazon has has you just put in
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
Halo lights and a ton of them come up
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
they're all LED and
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
there those are the only ones that are
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
color changing the stock ones do not
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
change color I haven't seen them so I'm
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
going to keep my eye out when yeah
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see them purple pink all kinds
 
01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.240 align:start position:0%
they actually move there's all kinds of
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
different colors over okay thank you
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions from the
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you thank
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you and with that I
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any other cards uh for any
 
01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
further testimony on this so I am going
 
01:01:52.029 --> 01:01:52.039 align:start position:0%
to close this will close the the exec
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
session on HB 11 22 public hearing on
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%

1123

01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%

personal information Beyond name and
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
address um we I held off for a few
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
minutes hoping the prime sponsor would
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
make it but whether it's weather or not
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure in the meantime as in
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
courtesy uh the chair recognizes
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%

11:27 relative to the revocation and
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
suspension of driver's
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
licenses chair recognizes the prime

Leon thank you Mr chairman and members
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
of the transportation committee for the
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
record my name is Erica Leon and I
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
represent the town of
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
dairy today I am here to introduce House
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 1127 which is a bill in two parts
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
um the first part of the bill deals with
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
the suspense the license the handling of
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
suspended licenses at the DMV and the
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill is to deal with
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
um a missing couple of words in some of
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
our statutes regarding driving a motor
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle with a suspended license I will
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
start first with um the DMV aspect of
 
01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
this um so I am on Jael car the
 
01:21:38.070 --> 01:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
administrative rules committee and we
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
were speaking about some of the
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
different um changes that were happening
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
at the DMV and how they were looking to
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
change how they handle suspended
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
licenses because um there's there's
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
quite a few reasons why they don't
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
actually want to hold on to them today
 
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
um this is something that the department
 
01:21:55.390 --> 01:21:55.400 align:start position:0%
can speak to better than I can and they
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
are here today and um those are
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
basically around losing LIC losing the
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
licenses potentially in the storage at
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
the DMV having to mail it to people
 
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
having people not have what is our DEA
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
facto form of identification with their
 
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license or having to get a
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
non-driver's ID which is um yet another
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
step in another hurdle more recently
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
this has become a larger issue because
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
the DMV is part of state to state it is
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
a process that will flag a driver a
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
person as either a driver or a
 
01:22:27.229 --> 01:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
non-driver based on what type of
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
identification they have and when you
 
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
this is to make sure that people don't
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
hold duplicate licenses and dupli in
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
multiple States so if you had a
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
non-driver's license because your
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
license had been suspended in New
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you move to another state
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
they'll see the non- driver pointer and
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
they may not pull your driving record
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know you could be the worst driver
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the world with a record you know long
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
enough to drown this room in paper but
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
with a non-driver pointer your new state
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
may not know know that and may give you
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
a license so this is to close up those
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
loopholes uh the other is surrounding
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
driving a motor vehicle in the state not
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
upon a way after a suspended license um
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
so I made a huge terrible mistake after
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
session in 2022 I had a couple too many
 
01:23:12.669 --> 01:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
drinks here in conquer and on my way
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
home I was arrested for a DUI there were
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of consequences that were
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
very appropriate to that but one
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
consequence of that was not appropriate
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
um in the statutes after a suspended
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
license you cannot operate a motor
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle anywhere in the state the way a
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle is described is anything
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
that is not under muscle power and is
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
not on stationary tracks that means my
 
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
husband had to do the errands take the
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
kids and then he'd have to come home and
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
mow the lawn because I was prohibited
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
from driving the riding lawn mower
 
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
because it is a motor vehicle I was also
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
prohibited from using the tractor for
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
the garden and all of these other issues
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
ises um I have done a deep dive nobody
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
has ever been convicted for this but I
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't that nobody has even been charged
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
with operating on their own private
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
property with a motor vehicle but was I
 
01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
to make the gamble about spending seven
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
nights in jail just to take a little bit
 
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:12.199 align:start position:0%
more off in my husband's plate he said
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
I'll do the lawn I'll do all of this you
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
know I support you but he didn't do
 
01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
anything wrong I
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
did and you look at my situation but
 
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
then you look at somebody whose job is
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
working for a landscaping company you
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
know they may not be driving the truck
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
but their job is to mow people's Lawns
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know the question about whether or
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
not their employer wants to keep them
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
after a DUI or another suspension is up
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
to the employer but if the employer
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
thinks that they are valuable member of
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the team and they realize what they did
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
wrong and they're sober at work as they
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
should be on these lawnmowers do we want
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
to take away somebody's only method of
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
employment you know the consequences are
 
01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:51.639 align:start position:0%
strong but we need to make sure that
 
01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:53.719 align:start position:0%
there are not additional unnecessary
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
implications that follow that were never
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
intended in the process um of when
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
somebody is convicted of one of these
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
duwi so um this actually goes back to
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
how motor vehicles used to be described
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
in statute before we totally redid our
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
statutes a motor vehicle was described
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
as something that operates on a way um
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
we had our other driving rules but when
 
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
they were sort of standardized it was
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
left out to say that no person shall
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
drive a motor vehicle in this state
 
01:25:23.229 --> 01:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
while the person driver's license or
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
privilege to drive is suspended or
 
01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
revoked by the action of the director or
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
the justice of any Court in the state or
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
any competent out of state
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um the second section which
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
is section four simply adds the words
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
upon away which standardizes that with
 
01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
all of our other rules U surrounding
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
driving um the other part there is a
 
01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
small little wiggle down in um section
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
five and six I don't know if any of you
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
guys have tried to find the boundary of
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
your property um um it is a nebulous
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
line that without a surveyor you don't
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
know where it is um and if you're mowing
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
your lawn somebody from the town who
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't like you happens to know where
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
that line is and you don't and you Veer
 
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
your lawn mower onto it that could get
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
your seven nights in jail again so um
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
this would just simply say that any
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
unimproved land between the boundary and
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
um between the boundary line of your
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
property and the roadside um would be
 
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
considered part of your property and not
 
01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
the way just because if you have grass
 
01:26:23.550 --> 01:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
that's going up to then a gravel
 
01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
shoulder you know it's kind of crazy
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
that you have to know exactly where that
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
line is so um I hope that she'll be able
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
to um make things a little easier for
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles in the
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
license suspension process so that they
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to be surrendered and um also
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
just make it so that we don't have this
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh sort of Damocles hanging over
 
01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's heads saying that nobody's
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
ever been prosecuted but do you want to
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
be the test case so with that I'm happy
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:53.350 align:start position:0%
to take any
questions

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:55.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much it does look
 
01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
like you've done your homework my first
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
question is would you like to join us on
 
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation depends when you
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
meet represent St
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you um and thanks for coming
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
forward with this bill have you ever met
 
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
anybody in your entire life in this
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
state that knew that if you lost your
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
license for driving any influence that
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
would affect that you could not mow your
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
lawn on a motor IED lawnmower no I
 
01:27:27.109 --> 01:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
haven't and I've actually had dozens if
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
not more lawmakers tell me that no you
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's proper property you can still
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
operate your lawnmower um but
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know our job well our
 
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity today is to make our laws
 
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
actually say that thank
 
01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
sakes thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
I want
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
to I want to walk up walk away from the
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
lawnmower part of the bill to the the
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
part of the bill where it talks about
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
surrendering of a driver's license and
 
01:28:03.149 --> 01:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
that seems to me as a much more
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
substantive um real world problem versus
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
nobody who's ever been convicted about
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
driving their lawm so could you just go
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
into a little could you please go into a
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
little more detail about how
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
that lack of surrending or um would
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
would work in the real world for people
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I can definitely go into
 
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
that um as you're aware many places you
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
go you're required to show ID whether
 
01:28:33.990 --> 01:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's to buy beer or wine or liquor buy
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
your cigarettes um to go vote um to
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
enter certain private events where you
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
need to validate who you are um there's
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
our driver's license has become a de
 
01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:47.119 align:start position:0%
facto identification card more than it
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
has become a permit to drive so with
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
this you need to also need to show your
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
driver's license when you're flying or
 
01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
when you're traveling so um it becomes a
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
significant hardship when you don't have
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
an ID ID card to show and to provide um
 
01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that had been
 
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
raised by somebody is well what if you
 
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
still have your license but your license
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
has been suspended will the police know
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
um I was talking to Senator Lang who um
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
who used to do be on the other side of
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
those stops with people and he said that
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
almost every single time you stop you
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
have a radio and you call it in you call
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
for a check on the person and the
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
validity of the of the license there may
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
be a couple times when your radio
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't work but you know there's also
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
the question too if maybe somebody gets
 
01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:36.280 align:start position:0%
off that time when the when the radio
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
isn't working but do you want to
 
01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
potentially end up in a confrontation
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
with somebody who's already knowingly
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
breaking broking the law when your radio
 
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't work I don't think that would be
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
a good idea you know there could be the
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
possibility of marking your license in
 
01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
some way but then you're also it it
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
becomes more of a cost it becomes more
 
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
complicated I'm not sure that that's
 
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
necessary with the license um the other
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
part is around if you do surrender it
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
and then get a non-driver's license then
 
01:30:06.070 --> 01:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
um then that works except it's another
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
trip in I know there's a lot of people
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
that are concerned about all of these
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
different costs that may be small to us
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
but may be the thing that ends up
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
meaning that a family Skips a meal
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
because they're spending an Uber to go
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
get to the DMV and then go spend $10 on
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
a non- driver's ID for some of us that's
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
not a big deal but for others it is um
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
but I really think that the largest most
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
glaring reason for this change is the
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
state's move into state to state because
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
having that system that can I make sure
 
01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
that nobody has um a state issued ID
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
that it in multiple States and the fact
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
that you're flagged to either a driver
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
or a non-driver really opens up a big
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
potential Wormhole of unintended
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
consequences if we require people to
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
surrender those licenses so this has
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
been an established practice at the
 
01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
department for a while it happened under
 
01:30:57.109 --> 01:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
previous leadership and it's continued
 
01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
under the current leadership to send
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
those licenses back um they they had
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
been operating because um the previous
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
the previous leadership within there had
 
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
already established it they didn't
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
recognize that there was a gap in our
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
laws that needed to be remedied so when
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
that came to the four at the Jael car
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
meeting they asked if anybody would help
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
volunteered any further questions from
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Coker thank
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh so you mentioned the
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
um um you uh you mentioned the penalty
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
for driving on a suspended license
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's seven days in or seven nights in
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
jail is that or ents the penalty for
 
01:31:42.109 --> 01:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
driving under a license that's suspended
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
under a reckless or a DUI or any of
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
those more enhanced charges as they
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
should be is uh lengthens um time of
 
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
license suspension I forget if it's 6 or
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
91 months additional plus seven nights
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
in jail okay all right thank you you're
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for your testimony um
 
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:07.280 align:start position:0%
we uh over the summer there was a rumor
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
running around and I'm not sure if you
 
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
heard it of of um people being um
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
stopped for DUI but but some judge in
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was suggesting to whoever
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
lost their license go pick up an
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
electric bike and uh and off you go um
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me from your testimony that
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
that would not be good
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
advice I would agree that that's
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
probably not good advice I've heard that
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
before and I knew a decade plus ago
 
01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who had an electric bike
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
there's some part of the statutes that
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
may have some wiggle room there but this
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
part here um this part here that's being
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
addressed in um RSA
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
23664 would make it clear that even if
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
under another section of the statutes
 
01:32:56.669 --> 01:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
you were okay to operate that electric
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
bike you can't under the statute and
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
this as this would change it still would
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
say that you can't operate that electric
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
bike upon a
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
way I look um does it also in um in that
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
statute does it also follow that you
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to use your battery
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
powered wheelchair or any other
 
01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:24.470 align:start position:0%
powered wheelchair or any other
device

01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
um if you look at a strict
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation of a motor vehicle it is
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
battery powered it is on Wheels um and
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
actually it as you bring that up it may
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
be because the electric bikes if they're
 
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
just the one that has the extra motor
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
kick if you pedal and then have that
 
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
extra assist that may be one of those
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
gray areas between it about it not being
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
a moped but being something that's an
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
assisted Pedal Power um then if you get
 
01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
into these powered wheelchairs it's kind
 
01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
of discriminatory if you have somebody
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
you can sort of kick along able to use
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
their powered wheelchair after after a
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
suspension but somebody who can't sort
 
01:34:03.149 --> 01:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
of kick along and and do a little bit of
 
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
Flintstones move it from time to time to
 
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
have some muscle involved um that would
 
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
just be absolutely discriminatory thank
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
you you raised great points we'll look
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
into that because actually the
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs are they have another
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
definition of personal Mobility device
 
01:34:21.109 --> 01:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
so we'll look into that good point
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
anybody from the committee
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
chair so what about um getting back to
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
driver's license and IDs and stuff like
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
that what is what about um instead of
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
the driver's license being taken that uh
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
you have to voluntarily give it up in 10
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
days and get a non-driver's license
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
issued or if they do take one you know
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
then you have 10 days to go down and
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
swap it out to get a non-
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
driv um thank you so the way that that
 
01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
currently operates with some of the
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
suspensions is they will take it at the
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
time and then give you a sheet that
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
allows you to drive for 30 days um if
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
you are looking at one of the ALS um
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
suspensions um I I looked into all these
 
01:35:07.629 --> 01:35:07.639 align:start position:0%
different forms so with an ALS
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
suspension they take the license but
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
give you the pink sheet but with that
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
then it's returned the license is
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
returned to you in the mail with one
 
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
form that says here's your license and
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
another form that says you know if for
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
every day you hold it you're going to
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
have your license suspended longer so
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
this is part of a clean up and a true up
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
of the of the rules and then the laws
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
and the representative from the DMV will
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
be better able to speak to those
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
specifics for
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
you anybody representative
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
you representative for being here
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
know why
 
01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
LSA when legislative Services why they
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
didn't separate this is common sense
 
01:35:52.350 --> 01:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
legislation I so thank you for bringing
 
01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:55.159 align:start position:0%
it forward but why didn't they separate
 
01:35:57.149 --> 01:35:57.159 align:start position:0%
the driver's license issue and the
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
boundary issue into two
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
bills uh well thank you both of these
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
are regarding suspended licenses and so
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
since they're both part of suspended
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
licenses they sort of work together and
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
then we have one hearing as opposed to
 
01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
multiple hearings um it what it's just a
 
01:36:15.629 --> 01:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
technical change um as far as the
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
procedures of the department in order to
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
make that change to the statutes to back
 
01:36:20.189 --> 01:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
up the practice that they've been
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
undergoing and and um this other one as
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
well is is something that takes what
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
seems to be a common sense understanding
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
and puts it into
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
law I was just thinking that there could
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
be other issues that followup I'm sorry
 
01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chairman yes follow up okay
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
I was just wonder there could be other
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
issues where the definition of the
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
boundary takes place other than
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
driving okay and uh would we be
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
upsetting a definition somewhere El else
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
in another piece of
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislation um thank you that is a very
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
good question if you look at section six
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
on page three um that's lines 30 through
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
33 in the definition of a way um it adds
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
a new subparagraph three that says for
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
the purposes of um RSA 26364 that's the
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
one driving with um with a suspended
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
license any unimproved land between the
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
boundary lines described in paragraph
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
one and the maintained portion of the
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
roadway um and that
 
01:37:23.709 --> 01:37:23.719 align:start position:0%
has um if you go back to section one
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
which is in uh sorry sub paragraph one
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
which is just above that in section five
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
it has the definition of way there's
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
already a carve out for the paragraph
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
two so this simply would add another
 
01:37:36.910 --> 01:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
carve out for that paragraph three that
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
only for the purposes of driving with a
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
suspended license would that change in
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
the definition of way take hold that
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.199 --> 01:37:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative s yeah I just um you
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
may not be able to answer this for us
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
but um perhaps in your uh maybe you will
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm hopeful
 
01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
um on line 32 of paragraph with
 
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph three I forget what page it is
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
um you talk about for the purposes of
 
01:38:15.629 --> 01:38:15.639 align:start position:0%
the RSA get that any and this is where
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling a little bit unimproved
 
01:38:22.589 --> 01:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
land what is that is it defined
 
01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere is it defined under the rsas
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
for motor vehicle operation is it a land
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
use zoning thing I mean I'm very
 
01:38:35.589 --> 01:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about what that actually means
 
01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question if there
 
01:38:39.310 --> 01:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
is a better term I would be happy to
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
change the term however when I asked at
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
OS um I asked various different bodies
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
what you would describe as sort of the
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
edge of the lawn the edge of whatever
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
land that you have that it doesn't have
 
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
a sidewalk on it it doesn't have parking
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
area on it it doesn't have any
 
01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
improvements so if you look at even even
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
a drainage ditch is going to be an
 
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
improvement so as long as there are no
 
01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
improvements to the land that take it
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
from its natural state Beyond just a
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
vegetative um issue that that that's
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's the intention of it if there's a
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
clearer way to say it I'd be open to
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
that because the clearer our laws are
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
the more people know if they actually
 
01:39:19.189 --> 01:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.350 --> 01:39:22.360 align:start position:0%
not yeah so my thank you for your answer
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's I think it it points to the
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
conundrum that we I think the committee
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
um I I wonder
 
01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
how if you know I wonder do you have any
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts about who we might ask about
 
01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
this because just by your statement
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
earlier does that not
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
include when you plant grass that's
 
01:39:52.229 --> 01:39:52.239 align:start position:0%
improving the
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
land see that's that these are the kinds
 
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
of things that are buzzing around in my
 
01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
head and I I I think we're going to need
 
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
to work on this and I'm I I love the
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
idea of the you should be able to take
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
your Almo and use it I have no problem
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
with that I but I don't want to
 
01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
introduce ambiguities you know um thank
 
01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
you I can talk to some people in the
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
planning department in my town and get
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
some advice as to who to speak to to see
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
um I I haven't seen planting a lawn as
 
01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:21.510 align:start position:0%
um I I haven't seen planting a lawn as
improved

01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
improved
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
as much work as my husband puts into it
 
01:40:26.589 --> 01:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
all the tilling and leveling and seating
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
and adding compost uh it's it's never
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
been considered an improvement when
 
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
looking for taxation or any sort of
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.750 --> 01:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
use you're welcome yeah yeah couple of
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
good points raised and we will look for
 
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
some legal definitions uh any other
 
01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee and so you
 
01:40:49.149 --> 01:40:49.159 align:start position:0%
know I we do have somebody from the
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles signed up
 
01:40:51.870 --> 01:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
to speak as
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
well seeing none thank you very much if
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
I can say one more thing before I go if
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
you do want to clean up that a powered
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
wheelchair is not a motor vehicle I
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
would view that as a friendly Amendment
 
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
if that's something that you wanted to
 
01:41:06.669 --> 01:41:06.679 align:start position:0%
include because I can't imagine that
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
being a standalone bill but I think it
 
01:41:09.149 --> 01:41:09.159 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
worthy we're going to look at that
 
01:41:12.270 --> 01:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
because we also have to look at some of
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
the electric bicycles scooters and
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
everything else which is also
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
potentially being classified as personal
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
Mobility Vehicles by the federal
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
government so
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you we we may reach out to you for
 
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
some help um and no other questions
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh next up chair
 
01:41:30.109 --> 01:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
recognize Jen for Bailey from Department
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles in support of the
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill good morning chairman member of the
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh my name is Jenifer Bailey I am
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
with the Division of Motor Vehicles and
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill um we did
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
request the force first part of it for
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
surrendering of the license um so as
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
representative Lon discussed in
 
01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
2022 New Hampshire went live with state
 
01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
to state state to state is a program
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
that is rolling out Nationwide that
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
limits um a driver to one credential
 
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
therefore if you have another state so
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
you are a New Hampshire resident you
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
move to Massachusetts try to not
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
surrender your license to transfer
 
01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
officially to them it will come through
 
01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
and cancel your New Hampshire license so
 
01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
you only have one valid credential no
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
matter which jurisdiction you are
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
residing in or hold a credential in um
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
so when we did that
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
we um eliminated the need to surrender
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
your driver's license when you're
 
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
suspended so not all violations require
 
01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:32.679 align:start position:0%
you to surrender your license um the
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
ones that do are the ALS DWI Reckless
 
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
habitual offender and failure to file an
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
SR22 insurance policy any other if you
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
have a ticket that you're suspended for
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to surrender your license
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
what this did was it put a restriction
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
on your record that until you turned in
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
or Surrender Ed your license you could
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
not reinstate whether your time was up
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
or not um this also required you to
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
either mail in drop off at a local DMV
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
office or bring into the conquered DMV
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
to turn that license in and get a non-
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
driver's ID under state to state an
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
active credential is considered one that
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
is active or suspended therefore if you
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
get a non driver's identification card
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
your license then gets cancelled so
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're suspended yes but now your actual
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
license is also cancelled so if you then
 
01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
reinstate you have to go visit a DMV
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
office to have your license reissued to
 
01:43:35.589 --> 01:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
you we do that in a duplicate process
 
01:43:37.470 --> 01:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
but it was an added process that an
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
applicant then has to come in for so
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
when this happened we changed internally
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
our process that you no longer had to
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
surrender or get an ID and if we did
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
have them turned into them us we would
 
01:43:50.830 --> 01:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
send a send back letter stating that you
 
01:43:53.070 --> 01:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
may keep your license to use as
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
identification not for purposes of
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
driving um that has eliminated a cabinet
 
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
of thousands of licenses that we were
 
01:44:05.229 --> 01:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
holding um it eliminates the risk of us
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
misplacing those licenses or mailing
 
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
them back incorrectly so we are in
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
support of this part of this bill and we
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
did request for this to maintain how
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're currently running our practices we
 
01:44:20.669 --> 01:44:20.679 align:start position:0%
just are aware that the law did not
 
01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
match what we were doing and we're
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make that now match um the
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill we um also see
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
no issues with I did provide some
 
01:44:34.149 --> 01:44:34.159 align:start position:0%
written testimony and the upon away is
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
used in several other um driving offense
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
laws so RSA 2631
 
01:44:41.119 --> 01:44:42.750 align:start position:0%
laws so RSA 2631
26363

01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
26363
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
26582 265 A3 A4 and 14 are all laws that
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
you cannot be convicted of those vi
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
violations unless you are driving Upon A
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
Way in a motor vehicle so changing the
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
other law of operating after suspension
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
to also be upon away matches it to every
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
other violation law um that is all I
 
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
have I do have the RIS and testimony
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
with um more statements um but I'm open
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
for questions if you have any thank you
 
01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
very much questions from the committee
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair thank you do you
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
notify other states that if they they
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
somebody shows an ID they're stopped
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
they're not driving but I want to see
 
01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's ID in the car and they show
 
01:45:30.030 --> 01:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
that ID and it's under suspension but
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
you've not required for that license to
 
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
be turned in now have you notified other
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
states that they don't need to be
 
01:45:38.910 --> 01:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
grabbing these licenses yes we did go
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
through law enforcement and through um
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
other agencies that they no longer have
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
to surrender them right now the only
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
licenses that we do get surrendered to
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
us on a normal basis are ones um for
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
stock s with als's those ones are still
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
coming to us and we do mail those back
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
currently so I just a quick follow
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
clarify so you're telling me that all
 
01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
other 49 states have been notified their
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
law enforcement not to pull a driver's
 
01:46:07.950 --> 01:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
license from a New Hampshire residents
 
01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.790 align:start position:0%
license from a New Hampshire residents
resident

01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
resident
 
01:46:13.229 --> 01:46:13.239 align:start position:0%
because they don't need to well we don't
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
we actually have I've been with the DMV
 
01:46:17.550 --> 01:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
for 18 years and we've never had a
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
license turned in from an out of state
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer um so I'm not
 
01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:25.639 align:start position:0%
sure that they're collecting them but we

01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
longer and it wasn't necessarily law
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement that took them it was in
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
their letter to surrender them to the
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%

01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
them the only ones that law enforcement
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
took the license for was for ALS

their um license so you only mail it out

conquer for example and retrieve it
 
01:47:07.350 --> 01:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
personally or does it have to be mailed
 
01:47:09.709 --> 01:47:09.719 align:start position:0%
no if the only location they can go to
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
have it physically handed to them is the
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%

while you're under suspension if your
 
01:47:25.390 --> 01:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
license expires that would be one case
 
01:47:27.669 --> 01:47:27.679 align:start position:0%
where you would have to opt to get a
 
01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:29.719 align:start position:0%
non-driver in place because you cannot
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%

with that at that point do they what's
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%

01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
come to a DMV location and have their
 
01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:55.440 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you Mr chair and members
 
03:05:03.710 --> 03:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I uh introduced this
 
03:05:06.990 --> 03:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill um uh based on information I
 
03:05:10.110 --> 03:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
received from uh one of my constituents
 
03:05:13.630 --> 03:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
or a cons constituents family uh are
 
03:05:16.309 --> 03:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
here to uh maybe explain in better
 
03:05:18.990 --> 03:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
detail than I can but basically to
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
correct what I perceive to be and I hope
 
03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
the committee will agree is is sort of a
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
catch22 situation that exists under
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
current law the situation is this um
 
03:05:36.630 --> 03:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh the one of my constituents uh Martin
 
03:05:40.110 --> 03:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
moscowitz who will Who will testify next
 
03:05:43.309 --> 03:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
um is 16 years old he lives in Windam uh
 
03:05:45.990 --> 03:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
they live on cit's pond and he has a
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
small 12T boat that um has a i one or
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
two horsepower electric electric engine
 
03:06:00.550 --> 03:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
um he uses the boat uh to uh basically
 
03:06:04.510 --> 03:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
he he he takes he he uh buys ice cream
 
03:06:06.429 --> 03:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
in one form or another and he takes it
 
03:06:08.910 --> 03:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
out on the boat and he sells ice cream
 
03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
to other people that may be out on boats
 
03:06:12.950 --> 03:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
on the lake or whatever and donates a
 
03:06:15.070 --> 03:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
sub substantial amount of of the
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
proceeds that he makes uh to charity it
 
03:06:19.710 --> 03:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that's something that
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
we ought to encourage young people to do
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
as opposed to spending more time on
 
03:06:28.070 --> 03:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
their cell phones or or uh uh being on
 
03:06:31.950 --> 03:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
Facebook Etc the problem is this he had
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
the boat is registered it has tag
 
03:06:37.790 --> 03:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
numbers it has the regular registration
 
03:06:41.110 --> 03:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
but when he was out doing this he was in
 
03:06:43.870 --> 03:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
he was pulled over by Marine Patrol and
 
03:06:47.429 --> 03:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
said uh told that he's engaging in a
 
03:06:49.830 --> 03:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
commercial activity and therefore he has
 
03:06:51.790 --> 03:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
to have a commercial
 
03:06:55.030 --> 03:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
license he was willing to get the
 
03:06:57.190 --> 03:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
commercial license except that there's a
 
03:06:58.990 --> 03:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
regulation of the Department of Safety
 
03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
that says you can't have a commercial
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
license unless you're 18 um he's only 16
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
or at least was at the time um so I
 
03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
proposed this amendment uh to exempt
 
03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
situations similar to the one of Mr
 
03:07:20.389 --> 03:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
mosit now I I should
 
03:07:23.750 --> 03:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
emphasize that it's it's to the extent
 
03:07:25.590 --> 03:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
that the committee believes that a boat
 
03:07:28.349 --> 03:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
that is P that is a powered boat even if
 
03:07:30.830 --> 03:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
the it's a very low power engine ought
 
03:07:34.269 --> 03:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
to be registered I don't I'm not I'm not
 
03:07:35.870 --> 03:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that shouldn't be the
 
03:07:38.229 --> 03:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
case and I don't think he is either um
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
but but the problem here is he's been
 
03:07:43.630 --> 03:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
told in effect he needs to have
 
03:07:45.790 --> 03:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
two licenses if you will one for the
 
03:07:47.630 --> 03:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
boat to be registered and one for him to
 
03:07:49.950 --> 03:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
engage in commercial activity and he
 
03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
would even I guess be willing to to get
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
the the commercial activity license if
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
he could but there but he's being told
 
03:07:58.309 --> 03:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
no you can't do it because you're not
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
18 it seems to me that that's you know I
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
have some difficulty understanding what
 
03:08:08.469 --> 03:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
what uh public protection interest is
 
03:08:10.670 --> 03:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
Satisfied by this if the boat needs to
 
03:08:13.510 --> 03:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
be registered great but he ought to be
 
03:08:14.910 --> 03:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
able to do what he's doing I mean I
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
think this is something that the law
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
should encourage not not prohibit and so
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
that that's basically the uh the purpose
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill if I if you know if it
 
03:08:29.710 --> 03:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be redrafted in some way um uh
 
03:08:33.990 --> 03:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
to to to accomplish more precisely what
 
03:08:36.510 --> 03:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
what the uh what my purpose is I'm more
 
03:08:38.790 --> 03:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
than happy to do that to work with the
 
03:08:39.790 --> 03:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
committee or any members of the
 
03:08:41.670 --> 03:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
committee to try to do that but that's
 
03:08:45.229 --> 03:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
basically what what um my intent is and
 
03:08:47.790 --> 03:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
with that um I'm happy to answer any
 
03:08:50.269 --> 03:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir I see one
 
03:08:52.190 --> 03:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
already representative Hill thank you Mr
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:08:57.150 --> 03:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
question um I ran into this with a uh a
 
03:09:00.269 --> 03:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
child with a donut business um but we
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
ran into the Hawkers and peders side of
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
things as well um which I I'm seeing
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
nodding of heads behind you okay um but
 
03:09:13.710 --> 03:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
this is basically a um
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
a floating lemonade stand is it
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
not and and did you look up um where we
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
stand in New Hampshire for for lemonade
 
03:09:26.429 --> 03:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
stands and and the and the limits I
 
03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
don't recall if there was a $5,000 limit
 
03:09:31.389 --> 03:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
on things like that you know what I I I
 
03:09:33.670 --> 03:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
do have I do recall having some
 
03:09:35.510 --> 03:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
discussions about the lemonade isn't
 
03:09:36.670 --> 03:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
isn't there something that limits the
 
03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
lemonade stand to your property or
 
03:09:40.229 --> 03:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
something like that if you're if you're
 
03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
selling it on somebody else's property
 
03:09:43.550 --> 03:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
03:09:45.229 --> 03:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the details but I thought
 
03:09:47.070 --> 03:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
that there might be something he knows
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:53.710 --> 03:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
you actually hold on we'll call you up
 
03:09:56.790 --> 03:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
in a minute okay um so anyway I you know
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
I guess all I'm saying is what I think
 
03:10:03.309 --> 03:10:03.319 align:start position:0%
bottom line is there ought to be a way
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
for him to do this uh and right now he's
 
03:10:09.229 --> 03:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
he's just Flatout prohibited from doing
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
it and it just seems to me that that
 
03:10:13.110 --> 03:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense I don't as I
 
03:10:16.389 --> 03:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
said I I'll see what the why that's
 
03:10:18.910 --> 03:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
further some kind of good public
 
03:10:22.150 --> 03:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
policy representative C thank you Mr
 
03:10:23.910 --> 03:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
03:10:27.590 --> 03:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
question it looks to me like uh
 
03:10:29.790 --> 03:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not the vessel
 
03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
has a registration number on it he would
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
still be doing a commercial business so
 
03:10:38.630 --> 03:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking that what really needs
 
03:10:42.030 --> 03:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
to be addressed is the age minimum age
 
03:10:46.269 --> 03:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
for being able to to do commercial uh
 
03:10:48.790 --> 03:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
business that might be a way sure that
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
might be a way to uh to to handle the
 
03:10:54.030 --> 03:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
the the situation and again as I say I
 
03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
think um what what we ought to change is
 
03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
is is the basically what prohibits him
 
03:11:02.349 --> 03:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
from doing it and if the way to do that
 
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
is to change the the age that might make
 
03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to do
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
that representative SES thank you Mr
 
03:11:11.670 --> 03:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
03:11:13.349 --> 03:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I think
 
03:11:17.110 --> 03:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative C has hit on um the the
 
03:11:20.510 --> 03:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
points that I was curious about um one
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
is I'm concerned
 
03:11:25.110 --> 03:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
about I'm concerned that I'm going to
 
03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
phrase this a little bit that
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
um you've presented a very real world
 
03:11:34.590 --> 03:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
problem which demands and deserves a
 
03:11:38.190 --> 03:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
solution um but I I wonder why you chose
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
the route that uh of in terms of boat
 
03:11:45.070 --> 03:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
res uh registrations because there's a
 
03:11:48.110 --> 03:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff uh
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
from federal regulations and the funds
 
03:11:53.110 --> 03:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
that derive from boat registrations
 
03:11:55.950 --> 03:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a question about how
 
03:11:58.389 --> 03:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
algae is spread from pond to Pond and
 
03:12:00.030 --> 03:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
they try to keep track of the boats that
 
03:12:02.469 --> 03:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
are moving from one Pond to the next not
 
03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
that that's here but um there's speed
 
03:12:10.229 --> 03:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement issues it's there's a whole
 
03:12:12.429 --> 03:12:12.439 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff that it's a can of worms
 
03:12:12.439 --> 03:12:13.630 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff that it's a can of worms
that

03:12:13.630 --> 03:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:12:15.389 --> 03:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
that might be open and maybe the the
 
03:12:18.469 --> 03:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
easier fixed do you have um so I was
 
03:12:20.990 --> 03:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
curious about your point of view about
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
alternative Solutions versus the one
 
03:12:24.910 --> 03:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
you've presented us sure sure no and
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good question you know one of the
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
things um that I drafted the bill this
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
way initially because I thought it was
 
03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
sort of the simplest way but I
 
03:12:37.229 --> 03:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
understand your point I and I think I
 
03:12:39.630 --> 03:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
was not particularly focusing on what
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
you're what the concerns you're raising
 
03:12:43.750 --> 03:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
which I think are legitimate
 
03:12:47.070 --> 03:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
concerns the part of the difficulty is
 
03:12:50.590 --> 03:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
that I think this the the whole sort of
 
03:12:55.229 --> 03:12:55.239 align:start position:0%
270 statutory scheme is not all that
 
03:12:58.750 --> 03:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
clear um you know for example it's if
 
03:13:04.469 --> 03:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
you looked at just 270 e uh 2 and E4 um
 
03:13:08.030 --> 03:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
that talks about the registration of of
 
03:13:11.550 --> 03:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
of the vehicles it there's
 
03:13:14.830 --> 03:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
no there's no sort of uh reference in
 
03:13:21.870 --> 03:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:24.710 --> 03:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
27022 at least inferentially talks about
 
03:13:27.710 --> 03:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
having another sort of license the
 
03:13:32.389 --> 03:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
commercial license U Beyond just having
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh the boat registered and so um that
 
03:13:39.110 --> 03:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
was part I think part of the the
 
03:13:42.030 --> 03:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
difficulty that I that I uh was was
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
dealing with and and as I say I was not
 
03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of the particular issues that
 
03:13:48.469 --> 03:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
you raised but I I think they are
 
03:13:50.630 --> 03:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
legitimate legitimate
 
03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
issues follow yeah thank you Mr chair
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
again um representative so now I'm going
 
03:13:59.110 --> 03:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
to ask you
 
03:14:02.429 --> 03:14:02.439 align:start position:0%
a a somewhat loaded question so you can
 
03:14:05.710 --> 03:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
deal with it as you will um would you be
 
03:14:07.790 --> 03:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
amenable to
 
03:14:11.229 --> 03:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
having um amending the bill to fix the
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
problem which as I see it is that
 
03:14:16.790 --> 03:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
somebody 16 can't get a Parkers and
 
03:14:19.150 --> 03:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
peders license or whatever other kind of
 
03:14:21.790 --> 03:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
license that he needs amending the bill
 
03:14:23.990 --> 03:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
to fix that and then having it refer
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
re-referred to another committee because
 
03:14:29.349 --> 03:14:29.359 align:start position:0%
I I I I have some you know I think
 
03:14:31.870 --> 03:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
we're how do you feel about that yeah no
 
03:14:33.790 --> 03:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
I mean that that might I I would be
 
03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in how the
 
03:14:36.670 --> 03:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
Moscow which is what they have to say
 
03:14:38.070 --> 03:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
about that but I think that might make
 
03:14:40.110 --> 03:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
some sense the only question that I
 
03:14:43.630 --> 03:14:43.640 align:start position:0%
guess I would have is um
 
03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:46.510 align:start position:0%
guess I would have is um
is

03:14:46.510 --> 03:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:51.229 --> 03:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
this is is is what Mr moscowitz is doing
 
03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
is this really something that you want
 
03:14:56.469 --> 03:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
to characterize as commercial activity
 
03:15:00.550 --> 03:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
at all I mean without I you know it's
 
03:15:04.750 --> 03:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
it's at a pretty low level um uh and I
 
03:15:06.429 --> 03:15:06.439 align:start position:0%
and so I just I throw that out there
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you do maybe there are reasons
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
that you want to do that um uh and if
 
03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
and if that's if that's the case then
 
03:15:15.990 --> 03:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know I think it's perfectly it would
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
be perfectly legitimate to to simply
 
03:15:20.670 --> 03:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
lower the age so that somebody like Mr
 
03:15:23.790 --> 03:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
MTZ can is able to do it but I would
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
raised you know a broader question about
 
03:15:28.830 --> 03:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
whether you really want to consider this
 
03:15:31.389 --> 03:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
to be commercial activity at all um and
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
that's why you know I had put in the
 
03:15:36.630 --> 03:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
limits of uh it can't involve alcoholic
 
03:15:39.189 --> 03:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
beverages or uh things like that it
 
03:15:40.710 --> 03:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
can't it has to be under a certain under
 
03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
$5,000 a year that that kind of thing um
 
03:15:46.030 --> 03:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
and and obviously those you know the
 
03:15:49.229 --> 03:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
$5,000 is I I frankly just picked that
 
03:15:50.550 --> 03:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
out as something I thought sounded
 
03:15:52.750 --> 03:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable but if you know if it should
 
03:15:56.429 --> 03:15:56.439 align:start position:0%
be higher or lower or whatever um
 
03:16:00.309 --> 03:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
I defer to the committee on
 
03:16:03.150 --> 03:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
that any other questions from the
 
03:16:05.309 --> 03:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
committee the only one I have but I'm G
 
03:16:07.590 --> 03:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
to I'll defer it to somebody else why do
 
03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
I have a funny feeling there's some
 
03:16:11.870 --> 03:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
federal regulations involved in this but
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
but uh I'll ask I think somebody else is
 
03:16:15.830 --> 03:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
probably can nail the answer so thank
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:19.800 --> 03:16:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:16:23.110 --> 03:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
um I've
 
03:16:28.189 --> 03:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
got both of the m moscowitz is here
 
03:16:30.710 --> 03:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
would you like to come up together or
 
03:16:33.150 --> 03:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
individually okay then the chair
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
recognizes Martin and Aaron muscats who
 
03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
are in support of the
 
03:16:41.150 --> 03:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
bill if I can get you to state your name
 
03:16:44.349 --> 03:16:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Aaron mosz and uh this is
 
03:16:49.630 --> 03:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:51.790 --> 03:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
mosz um so to give you a little history
 
03:16:53.229 --> 03:16:53.239 align:start position:0%
and I'd love to respond to some of the
 
03:16:55.550 --> 03:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
questions that came up is the lemonade
 
03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
stand log I did research it and it does
 
03:17:01.150 --> 03:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
restrict you to your property and I
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
talked to the Marine Patrol the Marine
 
03:17:04.750 --> 03:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
Patrol said well if he stands on our
 
03:17:08.469 --> 03:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
dock on C's pond that's our property so
 
03:17:10.630 --> 03:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
he can sell whatever he
 
03:17:13.670 --> 03:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
wants but the minute he goes into the
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
lake now he's covered by state law and
 
03:17:18.189 --> 03:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
State Commercial
 
03:17:20.070 --> 03:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions so we did what we were
 
03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to we did get the Hawker and
 
03:17:23.189 --> 03:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
ped license while I think it should be
 
03:17:26.189 --> 03:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
free for kids under 18 we do pay for it
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
we paid for it for three years now um
 
03:17:30.670 --> 03:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired naval officer so I get
 
03:17:31.630 --> 03:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
mine for
 
03:17:35.630 --> 03:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
free but we have done all the research
 
03:17:36.710 --> 03:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
we've done everything we're supposed to
 
03:17:40.189 --> 03:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
do he has a 12- foot plastic
 
03:17:44.830 --> 03:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
Coleman robo with a 0.1
 
03:17:47.389 --> 03:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
horsepower electric trolling
 
03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
motor it is registered as as the other
 
03:17:52.710 --> 03:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative has talked about when I
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%

three years ago he's been doing this for
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
three years uh we were told we had to
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
register the boat as a commercial vessel
 
03:18:03.309 --> 03:18:03.319 align:start position:0%

boat as a commercial vessel I'm like you
 
03:20:14.269 --> 03:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
and at the same time the officer two
 
03:20:19.150 --> 03:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
years ago Saidi can't register this boat
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
as a commercial vessel you can't have a
 
03:20:22.790 --> 03:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's
 
03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
license he will have a New Hampshire
 
03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
State voting license at 16 when he turns
 
03:20:29.830 --> 03:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
16 this
 
03:20:32.110 --> 03:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
summer but he can't get a commercial
 
03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
voting license so he's 18 there's a lot
 
03:20:37.189 --> 03:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
of very con conflicting strange things
 
03:20:38.910 --> 03:20:38.920 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:20:43.189 --> 03:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
here and all in all Martin
 
03:20:46.670 --> 03:20:46.680 align:start position:0%
at 12 years old saw a Chronicle with me
 
03:20:48.309 --> 03:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
there was a child who was doing this in
 
03:20:48.319 --> 03:20:49.309 align:start position:0%
there was a child who was doing this in
Lake

03:20:49.309 --> 03:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
Lake
 
03:20:53.189 --> 03:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
winaki and they did a 15minute thing on
 
03:20:55.070 --> 03:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
this child who was doing this as a
 
03:20:56.710 --> 03:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
teenager and is now putting himself
 
03:21:00.030 --> 03:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
through college with a pontoon boat a
 
03:21:03.150 --> 03:21:03.160 align:start position:0%
hot dog stand popcorn pulling up the
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
boats and doing this and the whole
 
03:21:05.550 --> 03:21:05.560 align:start position:0%
article was
 
03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
about um how he got his his food
 
03:21:12.670 --> 03:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
license and now he's paying taxes
 
03:21:14.349 --> 03:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
and Martin and I looked at each other
 
03:21:15.910 --> 03:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
and said hey this is a great idea for
 
03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
cob pond it's a service people love
 
03:21:22.590 --> 03:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
it they get on Facebook and say where is
 
03:21:24.189 --> 03:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
Martin going to be
 
03:21:27.469 --> 03:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
today and the kids love it the renters
 
03:21:29.469 --> 03:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
love it he goes up to the boats in the
 
03:21:32.349 --> 03:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
middle of the lake they love it and the
 
03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol gives him
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
ultimatums last year when they pulled
 
03:21:39.030 --> 03:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
him over and said well you don't have a
 
03:21:41.349 --> 03:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
commercial boating license so you can
 
03:21:44.030 --> 03:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
get out of your boat and sell ice cream
 
03:21:45.790 --> 03:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
on anybody else's dock that's okay we
 
03:21:45.800 --> 03:21:47.229 align:start position:0%
on anybody else's dock that's okay we
don't

03:21:47.229 --> 03:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:21:49.229 --> 03:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
care but you can't go to the middle of
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
the lake and sell ice cream to people on
 
03:21:51.920 --> 03:21:53.710 align:start position:0%
the lake and sell ice cream to people on
a

03:21:53.710 --> 03:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
boat and it's very
 
03:21:59.550 --> 03:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
contradictory but I think the state
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
should be encouraging young
 
03:22:06.070 --> 03:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurship Martin made well gross
 
03:22:08.630 --> 03:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
receipts between $1,500 and $2,000 per
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
year he's donating between $4 and $500
 
03:22:14.590 --> 03:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
per year year to pancreatic research and
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
memory of his
 
03:22:18.670 --> 03:22:18.680 align:start position:0%
grandmother I think it's a great thing
 
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
for him it'll look great on his college
 
03:22:24.030 --> 03:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
application and I I think the state
 
03:22:26.389 --> 03:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
should support activities like this and
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
children like this who want to do
 
03:22:32.030 --> 03:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
this thank you thank you did you want to
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%

03:22:39.510 --> 03:22:39.520 align:start position:0%

up chair recognizes Tim dun Levy from
 
03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Marine Patrol opposed
 
03:22:58.550 --> 03:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
bill good morning Mr chair honorable
 
03:23:02.950 --> 03:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
members of the transportation committee
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Tim Dunley I come before you
 
03:23:07.429 --> 03:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
this morning representing the Department
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
of Safety Division of State Police
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
Marine Patrol unit uh and in the past
 
03:23:14.710 --> 03:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
several years ago in my prior position I
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
know I personally had conversations uh
 
03:23:19.990 --> 03:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
about this directly with the muset
 
03:23:23.830 --> 03:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
family uh without getting into specifics
 
03:23:26.950 --> 03:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
of every bit of testimony you've heard
 
03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh this morning truly this is a
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
circumstance where New Hampshire
 
03:23:34.110 --> 03:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
commercial boating law never considered
 
03:23:35.469 --> 03:23:35.479 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
activity um and so I come before you
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
today saying I agree with representative
 
03:23:44.189 --> 03:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
uh C incites that perhaps the
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
registration law is not the place to
 
03:23:48.750 --> 03:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
address this as we do have Federal
 
03:23:50.790 --> 03:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
requirements our federal exemptions I
 
03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
mean our state exemptions for vessel
 
03:23:55.189 --> 03:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
registration mirror that of the federal
 
03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
law and the coast guard for which we
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
receive federal funds for participating
 
03:24:02.950 --> 03:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
in to go beyond that to track these
 
03:24:05.950 --> 03:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
registration issues the DMV you may hear
 
03:24:09.710 --> 03:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
from them today um it's a software issue
 
03:24:13.950 --> 03:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
exempting boats uh less than 15 feet uh
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
and then also
 
03:24:18.030 --> 03:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
tracking the finances of an operation
 
03:24:20.469 --> 03:24:20.479 align:start position:0%
like this while this may be one how many
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
others are there that might pop up um
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
and knowing how much they're going to
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
earn but they they've got to register in
 
03:24:29.710 --> 03:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
May but the receipts don't come in until
 
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
September so there there are some issues
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
I respectfully suggest that you look at
 
03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:38.110 align:start position:0%
I respectfully suggest that you look at
RSA

03:24:38.110 --> 03:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
27030 where there is an exemption or a
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
caveat in the commercial boating
 
03:24:44.279 --> 03:24:46.309 align:start position:0%
caveat in the commercial boating
operators

03:24:46.309 --> 03:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
operators
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
law where someone other under 18 years
 
03:24:51.389 --> 03:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
of age can still operate a commercial
 
03:24:53.910 --> 03:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
boat with
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
restrictions um and and uh 16 years of
 
03:25:00.510 --> 03:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
age is still the magic number um but we
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
do allow 16 year olds to operate
 
03:25:05.309 --> 03:25:05.319 align:start position:0%
commercial boats when they are in in the
 
03:25:07.990 --> 03:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
case of a a camp sailing school
 
03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
situation where they are for rescue
 
03:25:12.229 --> 03:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
purposes only and if the wind dies and
 
03:25:14.229 --> 03:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
they need to to sailboat
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
in our commercial law currently is
 
03:25:21.309 --> 03:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
addressing things like fishing charters
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
the Mount
 
03:25:24.910 --> 03:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
Washington uh floating
 
03:25:28.830 --> 03:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants um Hotel tour boats where
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
those vessels are subject to the general
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
public boarding them not having any
 
03:25:35.950 --> 03:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
experience in case of an emergency so
 
03:25:38.750 --> 03:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
they those vessels and those operators
 
03:25:40.590 --> 03:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
are held to a higher standard to protect
 
03:25:43.870 --> 03:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
the public we recognize pedaling ice
 
03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
cream is not endangering 80 people on
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
board so perhaps we look at
 
03:25:53.710 --> 03:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
27030 and create something a little
 
03:25:57.349 --> 03:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
different uh that might accommodate for
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh the situation you have before you
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
today I will say that um when when and
 
03:26:07.189 --> 03:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
if you're entertaining that consider the
 
03:26:11.550 --> 03:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
age three years ago Mr MTZ was young Mr
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
musz was 12 or 13 and and Marine Patrol
 
03:26:17.429 --> 03:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
while the the the lemonade stand is on
 
03:26:19.870 --> 03:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk you're now subject to the
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
traffic of maybe it's Kitz Pawn maybe
 
03:26:24.790 --> 03:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's we's Bay on a
 
03:26:27.189 --> 03:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
Saturday I'm not questioning his
 
03:26:29.309 --> 03:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
decision making but we're opening up
 
03:26:31.150 --> 03:26:31.160 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to have potentially a
 
03:26:33.389 --> 03:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
12-year-old selling ice cream in in
 
03:26:36.309 --> 03:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
areas where maybe it's not safe so all
 
03:26:38.510 --> 03:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
things to consider I'm happy to work
 
03:26:40.910 --> 03:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
with uh with you folks on perhaps a
 
03:26:42.550 --> 03:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
solution and answer any questions you
 
03:26:45.309 --> 03:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
may have thank you very much sir
 
03:26:47.710 --> 03:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
question from the
 
03:26:50.429 --> 03:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
committee well you'll probably be
 
03:26:52.429 --> 03:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
hearing from a few of us but thank you
 
03:26:56.189 --> 03:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
very much uh next up chair recognizes
 
03:26:59.590 --> 03:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
Katherine and here Here We Go Again

Kathleen Dalman representing the
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles not taking
 
03:27:07.110 --> 03:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
a position on the bill yes thank you
 
03:27:08.790 --> 03:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you members I'm just
 
03:27:12.229 --> 03:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
here for informational purposes as um D
 
03:27:13.870 --> 03:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
talked about our system right now it
 
03:27:16.150 --> 03:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
isn't capable of tracking funds or
 
03:27:17.590 --> 03:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
anything like that so we'd have to
 
03:27:19.630 --> 03:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
reprogram our whole system which would
 
03:27:22.349 --> 03:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.389 --> 03:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
$25,000 all right thank you you're
 
03:27:25.630 --> 03:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
welcome take any questions if there are
 
03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
any sure are there any questions
 
03:27:27.880 --> 03:27:28.990 align:start position:0%
any sure are there any questions
representative

03:27:28.990 --> 03:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
Hill um tracking what uh so right here
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
it said more than $5,000 of gross income
 
03:27:37.790 --> 03:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
and if we' have to reprogram our whole
 
03:27:39.150 --> 03:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
system because right now we don't track
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:42.910 align:start position:0%
anything like
that

03:27:42.910 --> 03:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:47.389 --> 03:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
followup y um so it wouldn't be as
 
03:27:52.030 --> 03:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
simple as just having um any family
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
right in that they would that they are
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
doing this on the honor System that
 
03:27:58.429 --> 03:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
there's under 5,000 you would need we
 
03:28:02.349 --> 03:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
would need proof yeah
 
03:28:05.550 --> 03:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
okay representative Fox thank you Mr
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
chairman so do you track commercial
 
03:28:11.590 --> 03:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
sales other commercial sales we do not
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
we we track commercial boats how many
 
03:28:16.750 --> 03:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
boats we have we don't track commercial
 
03:28:21.309 --> 03:28:21.319 align:start position:0%
sale are there other commercial boats
 
03:28:23.830 --> 03:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
that provide a
 
03:28:27.469 --> 03:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
service such as this or similar or Food
 
03:28:29.910 --> 03:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
Service I honestly would not not know
 
03:28:29.920 --> 03:28:31.550 align:start position:0%
Service I honestly would not not know
that

03:28:31.550 --> 03:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
answer thank you you're welcome any
 
03:28:34.479 --> 03:28:36.030 align:start position:0%
answer thank you you're welcome any
other

03:28:36.030 --> 03:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:28:38.110 --> 03:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you very
 
03:28:41.309 --> 03:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
much thank you um Mr duny can I can I
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
ask you one more question can I call you
 
03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
back and that is yes sir an example of a
 
03:28:50.670 --> 03:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
a similar situation and we where Lake
 
03:28:53.189 --> 03:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
wiip basaki was mentioned that was UN
 
03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
chronical and successful and able to do
 
03:28:57.990 --> 03:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
it apparently is there a difference
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
between these two scenarios or did one
 
03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
get enforced and one not no it's I'm
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with that operation as well
 
03:29:06.309 --> 03:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
very familiar with it the registered
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
owner of the vessel is 18 years of age
 
03:29:10.189 --> 03:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
and there was a second person on that
 
03:29:12.910 --> 03:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
vessel the Young younger who was
 
03:29:16.269 --> 03:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
actually in chronicle was doing the
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
selling as an employee or as as a family
 
03:29:22.349 --> 03:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
member which is perfectly fine if Mr
 
03:29:24.070 --> 03:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
moscowitz was out there with his son and
 
03:29:25.429 --> 03:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
he's the registered owner and the
 
03:29:27.550 --> 03:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
operator at 18 years of age we don't
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
have an
 
03:29:32.429 --> 03:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
issue thank you very much I have nobody
 
03:29:34.469 --> 03:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
else signed up to speak so I'm going to
 
03:29:38.670 --> 03:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
03:29:41.469 --> 03:29:41.479 align:start position:0%
1158 uh we'll chat about this later on
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
how to tackle it um before before our
 
03:29:47.710 --> 03:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
exec session but uh whether it's maybe a
 
03:29:50.510 --> 03:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this one or we'll
 
03:29:53.670 --> 03:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
see um just give us a few minutes to
 
03:29:55.590 --> 03:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
regroup we'll be going right into house
 
03:29:55.600 --> 03:30:10.030 align:start position:0%
regroup we'll be going right into house
bill

03:30:10.030 --> 03:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:10.040 --> 03:35:40.110 align:start position:0%
 
118

03:35:40.110 --> 03:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.550 --> 03:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
okay welcome to back everybody going
 
03:35:45.630 --> 03:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing on House Bill
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
1118 relative to the issuance of
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses for aliens temporarily
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
residing in New Hampshire the chair
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
recognizes the prime sponsor
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:04.429 --> 03:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:36:06.830 --> 03:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
the committee for hearing me today I am
 
03:36:08.429 --> 03:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
Representative Steven Smith Sullivan
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
County District 3 Charlestown unity and
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
Newport in no particular
 
03:36:15.750 --> 03:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
order so um this bill is a thing that
 
03:36:17.269 --> 03:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
happens when somebody asks me to look at
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
a statute and I go oh my God no this is
 
03:36:23.229 --> 03:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
a mess um it's a big reorganization
 
03:36:26.910 --> 03:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
attempt so this applies to driver's
 
03:36:29.150 --> 03:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
licenses for aliens temporarily residing
 
03:36:30.030 --> 03:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
in New
 
03:36:33.670 --> 03:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the first thing I noticed was
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
someone told me that not all of these
 
03:36:37.189 --> 03:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
folks might have a Social Security
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
number but we had a statute with a whole
 
03:36:41.389 --> 03:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
process for giving them a license
 
03:36:45.070 --> 03:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
license the clean way to do that is to
 
03:36:47.550 --> 03:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
put in a disclaimer or a car out there's
 
03:36:49.950 --> 03:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of legal words for it the very
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
first thing you'll see that's bolded
 
03:36:57.429 --> 03:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding RSA 26340 a 26340 a is a
 
03:37:00.150 --> 03:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
standalone statute that requires anyone
 
03:37:01.710 --> 03:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
to have a Social Security number in
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
order to get a New Hampshire driver's
 
03:37:07.030 --> 03:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
license we might have been issuing these
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
to folks without driver's licenses
 
03:37:12.070 --> 03:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
because this is in
 
03:37:15.910 --> 03:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
26339 a but if we have been we ought not
 
03:37:17.790 --> 03:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
be doing that because it violates the
 
03:37:20.910 --> 03:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
other law because whenever we did that
 
03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
um 263 39a it was sloppy without the
 
03:37:29.189 --> 03:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
carve out so that disclaimer fixes
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
that moving down there is uh you'll see
 
03:37:36.750 --> 03:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
some bolded type beginning in paragraph
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
two now what paragraph two used to be
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
was a
 
03:37:44.910 --> 03:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
list all lowercase letters of
 
03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
identification stuff documentation stuff
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
proof that you know how to drive a
 
03:37:52.189 --> 03:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle or not and it was kind of
 
03:37:54.150 --> 03:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
jumbled together to me those are two
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
different categories I'm trying to look
 
03:37:58.030 --> 03:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
at it the average person to get an idea
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
of what do I actually have to do here is
 
03:38:02.070 --> 03:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
very confusing
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
so all of the I know how to drive a car
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
stuff is in the Bold type at the top now
 
03:38:11.070 --> 03:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
the certification from a foreign
 
03:38:12.670 --> 03:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
government reporting regarding the
 
03:38:14.750 --> 03:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
person's driving record and Licensing
 
03:38:17.710 --> 03:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
status that was already there to it I
 
03:38:20.550 --> 03:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
removed written or other testing proof
 
03:38:22.150 --> 03:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
of vehicle operation in the foreign
 
03:38:23.870 --> 03:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
country or proof of completion of an
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
approved driver ed education course
 
03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
acceptable director struck those out
 
03:38:32.670 --> 03:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
moved them up to the top and now you
 
03:38:35.110 --> 03:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
need one of those in order to show that
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
you know how to drive a car at the
 
03:38:39.309 --> 03:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
discretion of the
 
03:38:42.030 --> 03:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
director B was already there that's why
 
03:38:44.550 --> 03:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's not bold submission of social
 
03:38:46.269 --> 03:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
security number or if the person does
 
03:38:48.429 --> 03:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
not qualify for such number the
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
submission of certification to that
 
03:38:52.590 --> 03:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
effect as is acceptable to the
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner so that's the one that
 
03:38:55.870 --> 03:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
really wound my crank an explicit
 
03:38:57.990 --> 03:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
provision in state law that says you can
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
do this without a social security number
 
03:39:01.710 --> 03:39:01.720 align:start position:0%
without repealing modifying or
 
03:39:05.349 --> 03:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
referencing 26340 a is bad legislating
 
03:39:08.030 --> 03:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
and I probably participated in it so
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
there we
 
03:39:14.590 --> 03:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
are uh the paragraph three there here
 
03:39:17.870 --> 03:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
temporarily says so right in the title
 
03:39:21.510 --> 03:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
so the director will Peg the term of the
 
03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
license that they are issued with the
 
03:39:25.790 --> 03:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
length of their residence in their haire
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be valid after they go
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
home there is a drafting error that I
 
03:39:35.830 --> 03:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
would ask the committee to look at and a
 
03:39:39.550 --> 03:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
fix Roman numeral 2 says the director
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
may require any of the following uh that
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
means that the director is not required
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
to require any of the following and
 
03:39:50.469 --> 03:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
that's again to me sloppy legislating if
 
03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to give these list of
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
requirements well damn it is it the law
 
03:39:57.870 --> 03:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
or is it not like did we mean it so
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
considering that uh lowercase a that
 
03:40:05.990 --> 03:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
subparagraph is an option list you can
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
do any one of those things doesn't
 
03:40:11.550 --> 03:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
matter up to the director and we
 
03:40:14.429 --> 03:40:14.439 align:start position:0%
definitely want to know B if they've got
 
03:40:16.349 --> 03:40:16.359 align:start position:0%
a social security number a good reason
 
03:40:16.359 --> 03:40:17.790 align:start position:0%
a social security number a good reason
not

03:40:17.790 --> 03:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:40:21.070 --> 03:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
to and they can prove that which in
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner paragraph one Roman numeral
 
03:40:29.229 --> 03:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
one identifies the people the statute
 
03:40:32.229 --> 03:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
applies to so down in
 
03:40:32.239 --> 03:40:33.870 align:start position:0%
applies to so down in
two

03:40:33.870 --> 03:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:40:36.750 --> 03:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
c we would like them to show that they
 
03:40:38.830 --> 03:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
are one of those folks um we don't
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
specify the documentation requirements
 
03:40:42.550 --> 03:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
or what they have to show they just have
 
03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:43.469 align:start position:0%
or what they have to show they just have
to

03:40:43.469 --> 03:40:43.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
say more than an attestation I am one of
 
03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
these people here's what I have to show
 
03:40:51.710 --> 03:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
proof of identification we need to know
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
who they
 
03:40:55.030 --> 03:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
are whatever they can show the director
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable to DM DMV is fine but
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
these are the things that shall be
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
required so we want to know somehow that
 
03:41:06.110 --> 03:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
they know how to drive a car that if
 
03:41:08.309 --> 03:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
they don't have a Social Security number
 
03:41:11.309 --> 03:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
they have a good reason that they are
 
03:41:13.229 --> 03:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
one of the people this statute applies
 
03:41:15.189 --> 03:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
to and that they are who they say they
 
03:41:18.790 --> 03:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
are and uh most of this was existing
 
03:41:21.150 --> 03:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
policy the biggest change would be the
 
03:41:23.630 --> 03:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
ma to the Shell that we're absolutely
 
03:41:26.189 --> 03:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
going to do one of these things to
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
determine that you know how to drive a
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:41.910 --> 03:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
committee represenative Jones Thank you
 
03:41:44.950 --> 03:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh
 
03:41:47.070 --> 03:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative I think what you did hear
 
03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
is there's no really significant change
 
03:41:51.349 --> 03:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
you just made it more user friendly is
 
03:41:52.910 --> 03:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm reading
 
03:41:55.510 --> 03:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
here um thank you uh I guess it's kind
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
of a major change
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
that in Roman numeral to we're now
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
actually going to say that these things
 
03:42:06.510 --> 03:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
have to happen whereas before it said
 
03:42:08.349 --> 03:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
May and we all know that when you put
 
03:42:10.110 --> 03:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
May in a law it might happen might not
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
happen depends on who's around at the
 
03:42:14.429 --> 03:42:14.439 align:start position:0%
time so I guess that could be considered
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
a major change except that I believe the
 
03:42:19.189 --> 03:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
department has been doing these things
 
03:42:21.389 --> 03:42:21.399 align:start position:0%
already so hopefully it doesn't affect
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
them makes sense thank
 
03:42:26.910 --> 03:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
you representative SES thank you Mr
 
03:42:29.070 --> 03:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Smith thank you
 
03:42:31.630 --> 03:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I just want to
 
03:42:37.110 --> 03:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
be clear I if you can clarify for me
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
um you have um a requirement that they
 
03:42:44.349 --> 03:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
proof of identification as may be
 
03:42:47.309 --> 03:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the director might be the
 
03:42:49.830 --> 03:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
question belongs for the director but
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
will that proof uh include their age
 
03:42:53.840 --> 03:42:55.389 align:start position:0%
will that proof uh include their age
their

03:42:55.389 --> 03:42:55.399 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
um whatever their temporary residence
 
03:43:01.550 --> 03:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
within the state of New Hampshire is and
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
so on because typically when you get a
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license you have to prove how
 
03:43:07.429 --> 03:43:07.439 align:start position:0%
who you are how old you are and where
 
03:43:07.439 --> 03:43:08.870 align:start position:0%
who you are how old you are and where
you

03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
live I like it but um I was trying to do
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
this with a light touch and not affect
 
03:43:16.990 --> 03:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
what was there so I use the language
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
that was there um currently no it's not
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
required um I would imagine though that
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
any director would probably find that as
 
03:43:27.630 --> 03:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
the subset of being
 
03:43:30.349 --> 03:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
acceptable okay I didn't want to take oh
 
03:43:33.429 --> 03:43:33.439 align:start position:0%
sure I I would love to have ripped this
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
up started with a blank page but I was
 
03:43:38.990 --> 03:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
trying to First Do no harm sure thank
 
03:43:41.110 --> 03:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative C thank you Mr chairman
 
03:43:47.189 --> 03:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Tak my question uh they're on
 
03:43:49.469 --> 03:43:49.479 align:start position:0%
page one line 10 or
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
11 uh are you saying that it should be
 
03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
read the director shall require any of
 
03:43:54.600 --> 03:43:59.189 align:start position:0%
read the director shall require any of
the

03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
following yeah I don't know if you have
 
03:44:03.750 --> 03:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
the same kind of copy I do Roman numeral
 
03:44:05.229 --> 03:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
2 begins on
 
03:44:08.110 --> 03:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
911 yes all right so what I'd like to
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
see is rather than the director may
 
03:44:13.950 --> 03:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
require any of the following change it
 
03:44:17.229 --> 03:44:17.239 align:start position:0%
to the director shall require the
 
03:44:19.389 --> 03:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
following so the the proof that they
 
03:44:21.790 --> 03:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
know how to drive that was all included
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
in subparagraph a as an or or or or to
 
03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
facilitate doing that okay thank you any
 
03:44:30.359 --> 03:44:32.030 align:start position:0%
facilitate doing that okay thank you any
further

03:44:32.030 --> 03:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:44:35.110 --> 03:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
questions repr Rumbo just be sure I
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
understand follow up on the prior
 
03:44:39.429 --> 03:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
question thank you um that the way you
 
03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
moved and if if it were to say the
 
03:44:43.149 --> 03:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
director shall require the following
 
03:44:44.710 --> 03:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
would be any of the options in
 
03:44:48.990 --> 03:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
subsection a line 12 to 15 and then also
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
all the following b c d all those
 
03:44:54.670 --> 03:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
sections correct yep correct so so in a
 
03:44:56.670 --> 03:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's proven they know how to drive
 
03:44:58.910 --> 03:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
whichever one of those is acceptable and
 
03:45:00.590 --> 03:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
if they got another idea to add to it
 
03:45:02.429 --> 03:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
I'm open to it but this is all the
 
03:45:04.030 --> 03:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
language that was in the statute I just
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
moved it up but then yeah they um show
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
the social security number or why they
 
03:45:10.510 --> 03:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
don't have one
 
03:45:11.710 --> 03:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
prove that they're one of the folks
 
03:45:15.750 --> 03:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
listed in paragraph one and identify
 
03:45:18.750 --> 03:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
themselves somehow that's that's
 
03:45:21.269 --> 03:45:21.279 align:start position:0%
it further
 
03:45:24.149 --> 03:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing that thank you thank

Kathy
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
O'Neal um thank you for allowing us to
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
testify here this afternoon so I handed
 
03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
out written testimony um I will say that
 
03:46:02.229 --> 03:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
I drafted that written testimony based
 
03:46:03.910 --> 03:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
on the copy of the bill that I have
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
which is uh the copy um that is I just
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
had a supervisor at the DMV check the
 
03:46:10.630 --> 03:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
website the same copy that's on the
 
03:46:12.429 --> 03:46:12.439 align:start position:0%
website so that's what I'm working off
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
of I've had an opportunity to speak with
 
03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and get a little
 
03:46:18.670 --> 03:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
bit more clarification on aspects of the
 
03:46:20.670 --> 03:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
bill I will say that I confirmed with
 
03:46:22.110 --> 03:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety commissioner's
 
03:46:24.510 --> 03:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
office before I came here and before I
 
03:46:26.670 --> 03:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
issued this written testimony to oppose
 
03:46:28.189 --> 03:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
I have not had the opportunity to confer
 
03:46:30.510 --> 03:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
with them again on the updates and
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
explanations that representative Smith
 
03:46:34.189 --> 03:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
has offered um since I've been here at
 
03:46:36.510 --> 03:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
the lob so with that um I'm going to go
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
off of the version that I have and that
 
03:46:40.870 --> 03:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
we've reviewed as a team team um and I'm
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
just going to take it uh piece by piece
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
here um so the first section with
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
regards to um the social security number
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
um that is a practice where there's a
 
03:46:53.030 --> 03:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
denial letter that is brought in those
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
those individuals that are referenced at
 
03:46:56.429 --> 03:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the statute have legal
 
03:46:58.189 --> 03:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
status in the United States they have a
 
03:47:00.990 --> 03:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
legal right to come to the DMV and to go
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
through the testing and to receive a
 
03:47:05.149 --> 03:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
driver's license if they pass and so
 
03:47:07.710 --> 03:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
with that um if they don't have a Social
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
Security number um there is a denal
 
03:47:11.229 --> 03:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
letter that they bring with them to say
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
that they're not eligible and I'll let
 
03:47:16.030 --> 03:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
Kathy U O'Neal speak to that as if she
 
03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
has anything to add so typically workers
 
03:47:21.030 --> 03:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
or students f1s and such they they are
 
03:47:22.830 --> 03:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
not eligible for a social security card
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
they will be issued a denial letter from
 
03:47:25.950 --> 03:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
the actual Social Security
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
Administrative um they will come in with
 
03:47:29.710 --> 03:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
that um so we can proceed with their
 
03:47:29.720 --> 03:47:31.750 align:start position:0%
that um so we can proceed with their
licensing

03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
03:47:33.670 --> 03:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
transaction so there's currently a
 
03:47:36.349 --> 03:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
process to address um Social Security
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
numbers or lack thereof um that is a uh
 
03:47:41.870 --> 03:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
both the documentation to be here um in
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
a legal status and have the opportunity
 
03:47:45.510 --> 03:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
to come to the DMV and another Federal
 
03:47:46.750 --> 03:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
agency through the Social Security
 
03:47:48.910 --> 03:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
Administration on the denial letter to
 
03:47:50.830 --> 03:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
say the person's not eligible for the
 
03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
social security number um the second
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
part of the statute uh the May the
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
change from the director may require any
 
03:48:01.429 --> 03:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
of the following to a shall um I think
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's some issues that I see
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
right off the top there and I understand
 
03:48:06.149 --> 03:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
what representative Smith was trying to
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
do as he explained it to me he took
 
03:48:10.870 --> 03:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
section c WR or other testing and bumped
 
03:48:13.950 --> 03:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
it up um but right now if you look at
 
03:48:15.349 --> 03:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
certification from the foreign
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
government regarding the person's
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
driving record and Licensing status I'm
 
03:48:21.870 --> 03:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
being told by DMV supervisors we don't
 
03:48:23.950 --> 03:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
ask for that today so if we change that
 
03:48:27.870 --> 03:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
to a shell then okay that's one option
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
um in and amongst the others that are
 
03:48:31.349 --> 03:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
listed here and at the end or written or
 
03:48:33.429 --> 03:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
other testing um I could tell you right
 
03:48:35.590 --> 03:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
now that everybody that comes to the DMV
 
03:48:37.309 --> 03:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
that goes through the testing process
 
03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's a very very good process and
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
everybody starts with that same Baseline
 
03:48:42.950 --> 03:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
they don't pass the road test they come
 
03:48:44.429 --> 03:48:44.439 align:start position:0%
back they don't pass the knowledge test
 
03:48:45.870 --> 03:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
they come back they don't pass the
 
03:48:49.269 --> 03:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
vision Acuity test they come back okay
 
03:48:53.269 --> 03:48:53.279 align:start position:0%
so I say the written and other testing
 
03:48:55.710 --> 03:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
option is what I'm going to exercise and
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
why because that's what uh RSA
 
03:49:02.309 --> 03:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
2636 mandates um and it's also what the
 
03:49:05.269 --> 03:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
DMV rule set mandates for non- us
 
03:49:07.349 --> 03:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
transactions and any other transaction
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
for that matter so we're going to follow
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
the law we're going to go with the
 
03:49:13.950 --> 03:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
written uh and the physical road test
 
03:49:15.309 --> 03:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
that being said you could have a
 
03:49:16.950 --> 03:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
director that sits before you years from
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
now that says you know what uh
 
03:49:20.950 --> 03:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
everything here is an or uh I'm going to
 
03:49:23.030 --> 03:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
skip the written or other testing even
 
03:49:24.830 --> 03:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
though it conflicts with State Statute
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to say
 
03:49:28.910 --> 03:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
that um I need you to bring in proof of
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
previous vehicle operation in the
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
country uh or proof of completion of an
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
approved driver education course
 
03:49:37.990 --> 03:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the director well that's
 
03:49:40.830 --> 03:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
unfair that's unfair right now somebody
 
03:49:42.229 --> 03:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
from another country that comes into the
 
03:49:45.070 --> 03:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
DMV that has legal status that's here on
 
03:49:47.790 --> 03:49:47.800 align:start position:0%
a student visa or a work visa is able to
 
03:49:49.790 --> 03:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
come into the DMV present that
 
03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
documentation have it confirmed in the
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
save database and they're able to go
 
03:49:55.349 --> 03:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
through the testing like everybody else
 
03:49:57.630 --> 03:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
and get a driver's license if you have a
 
03:49:59.389 --> 03:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
different director that sits before you
 
03:50:01.349 --> 03:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
that says I'm going to lessen the
 
03:50:03.550 --> 03:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
written testing portion and I'm going to
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
go with that well what if it's somebody
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
that hasn't driven and we just changed
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
the DMV rule set through jail car
 
03:50:11.349 --> 03:50:11.359 align:start position:0%
because there's a section in there that
 
03:50:13.269 --> 03:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
existed for many many years and that
 
03:50:15.269 --> 03:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
section said if you came to the US from
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
another country and you came to New
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you were over 18 you had
 
03:50:22.630 --> 03:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
to take driver at even though if you're
 
03:50:24.750 --> 03:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
a US citizen and you're a New Hampshire
 
03:50:28.269 --> 03:50:28.279 align:start position:0%
resident and you're between 16 uh and 17
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
you take it and if you're over 18 you
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to you can come to the DMB
 
03:50:34.030 --> 03:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
and go right to the testing process we
 
03:50:36.349 --> 03:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
were having people in their 20s 30s and
 
03:50:38.429 --> 03:50:38.439 align:start position:0%
older coming from other countries around
 
03:50:40.229 --> 03:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
the world uh that were being held to a
 
03:50:42.189 --> 03:50:42.199 align:start position:0%
different standard we changed that and
 
03:50:43.389 --> 03:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
there's a bill that's coming forth
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
through Senator richardi to strike that
 
03:50:47.189 --> 03:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
in the statute as well to mirror the
 
03:50:49.590 --> 03:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
rule set um doing this would set us
 
03:50:51.189 --> 03:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
backwards from where we are right now
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to go forward and I think
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
that this law actually sets us backward
 
03:50:57.149 --> 03:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
by mandating with a sha that one of
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
those things is acceptable it's a policy
 
03:51:02.309 --> 03:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
decision by the director that's too much
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
power for the director to have we've got
 
03:51:06.670 --> 03:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
a state statute we've got a rule set
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
we've got a program over there let
 
03:51:10.950 --> 03:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
people satisfy the program
 
03:51:12.990 --> 03:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
program I also want to talk about
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreements you talk about
 
03:51:16.349 --> 03:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
standards just because somebody comes to
 
03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
the counter and they present a document
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
from another country I mean our
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
employees have a difficult enough job
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
preventing fraud conducting non- us
 
03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
transactions making that making sure
 
03:51:28.269 --> 03:51:28.279 align:start position:0%
that every document that comes into
 
03:51:31.229 --> 03:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
their possession is authentic it's
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
incredible what they're able to do but
 
03:51:34.469 --> 03:51:34.479 align:start position:0%
now we're going to go a step further and
 
03:51:37.269 --> 03:51:37.279 align:start position:0%
say Here's the document um in that
 
03:51:39.510 --> 03:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
document somehow has to be deconflict
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
with the country of origin to say not
 
03:51:43.550 --> 03:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
only is it a legitimate document but now
 
03:51:44.429 --> 03:51:44.439 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do go to the
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
website and figure out pick a country
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
around the world what are their driving
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
standards what does it take to get a
 
03:51:52.630 --> 03:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
license there do you have to take a road
 
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
test do you have to take a Knowledge
 
03:51:55.750 --> 03:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
Test how many questions are on it um
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
what's the caliber of travel in that
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
country is it a country that's more
 
03:52:03.510 --> 03:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
focused on U bicycle travel moped travel
 
03:52:05.309 --> 03:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle travel types of vehicles that we
 
03:52:08.030 --> 03:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
drive here in the US I don't know but I
 
03:52:10.590 --> 03:52:10.600 align:start position:0%
can tell you right now 400,000 customers
 
03:52:12.510 --> 03:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
that come through our doors every year
 
03:52:14.030 --> 03:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
DMV employees at the cter are not going
 
03:52:15.870 --> 03:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to decipher that and figure
 
03:52:18.429 --> 03:52:18.439 align:start position:0%
out um which country we can say yeah
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
you're good you don't have to take the
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
written test or the road test um you're
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
all set here you go here's a New
 
03:52:24.550 --> 03:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license go stand there and
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
have your photo taken that makes no
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
sense the one part of the bill that I
 
03:52:32.429 --> 03:52:32.439 align:start position:0%
look at that I say okay this this makes
 
03:52:34.590 --> 03:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
sense because we're already doing it is
 
03:52:34.600 --> 03:52:35.590 align:start position:0%
sense because we're already doing it is
section

03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:52:37.429 --> 03:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
three talks about the term of the
 
03:52:39.030 --> 03:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
license shall be no longer than 5 years
 
03:52:41.110 --> 03:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
years from the date of issuance and the
 
03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
director shall set a lesser term in
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
accordance with the length of the
 
03:52:46.389 --> 03:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
person's residence in New Hampshire
 
03:52:48.269 --> 03:52:48.279 align:start position:0%
we're already doing that it's Tethered
 
03:52:49.950 --> 03:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
to the federal documentation their
 
03:52:51.670 --> 03:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
length of stay is Tethered to the
 
03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
license is that correct C correct yes um
 
03:52:57.870 --> 03:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
so again it under undermines reciprocity
 
03:53:00.149 --> 03:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
agreements you know we have reciprocity
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
agreements with France we have a
 
03:53:03.510 --> 03:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreement with Canada uh
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're working on uh painstakingly a
 
03:53:08.189 --> 03:53:08.199 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreement with Taiwan I can
 
03:53:10.309 --> 03:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
tell you that uh DMVs around the country
 
03:53:11.990 --> 03:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
have reciprocity agreements with other
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
countries why do they have that they
 
03:53:16.670 --> 03:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
have that because they measured how they
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
test they've measured their standards
 
03:53:20.429 --> 03:53:20.439 align:start position:0%
they're similar one country that we're
 
03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
looking at is Jamaica Jamaica has a
 
03:53:24.349 --> 03:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
higher standard a higher threshold they
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
get a license to New Hampshire it would
 
03:53:28.429 --> 03:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
be very easy to enter into a reciprocity
 
03:53:30.030 --> 03:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
agreement with Jamaica and feel good
 
03:53:31.670 --> 03:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
about it but a lot of countries around
 
03:53:32.670 --> 03:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
the world we just don't know what their
 
03:53:34.229 --> 03:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
standards are and that's why you have
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
the reciprocity agreements and that's
 
03:53:37.750 --> 03:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
what the mvs around the country do and
 
03:53:39.229 --> 03:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
that's the right way to handle it the
 
03:53:41.149 --> 03:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
way to handle it is not this and make it
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
a policy decision and put it in the
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
court of a DMV director to say forget
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
the written for you I want to see that
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
you've driven a car before overseas
 
03:53:52.429 --> 03:53:52.439 align:start position:0%
that's not fair so we oppose the bill
 
03:53:55.950 --> 03:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:59.149 --> 03:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions from the
 
03:54:02.550 --> 03:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
committee represent Gorski thank you Mr
 
03:54:03.870 --> 03:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
03:54:06.070 --> 03:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned earlier this
 
03:54:08.030 --> 03:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
whole process starts you said with the
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
legal right to come to the DMV can you
 
03:54:11.630 --> 03:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit more what you mean
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
by the legal right yes sir um and I'll
 
03:54:17.149 --> 03:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
have uh supervisor O'Neal speak more to
 
03:54:18.550 --> 03:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
it um because she's been doing it for
 
03:54:20.550 --> 03:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
years I'm talking about visas I'm
 
03:54:22.950 --> 03:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
talking about a work visa student visa
 
03:54:24.590 --> 03:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
um something that has been vetted by the
 
03:54:26.550 --> 03:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
US government that gives the person
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
legal right um to attend academic
 
03:54:31.630 --> 03:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
institution or to work here in the state
 
03:54:33.070 --> 03:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire or in the US for that
 
03:54:35.429 --> 03:54:35.439 align:start position:0%
matter and they uh that documentation is
 
03:54:37.149 --> 03:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
on file with the federal government and
 
03:54:39.149 --> 03:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
they bring it to the DMV which which
 
03:54:42.550 --> 03:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
allows them uh the opportunity per uh
 
03:54:44.590 --> 03:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
State Statute and what is on the DMB
 
03:54:46.189 --> 03:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
website for what you need to bring in
 
03:54:48.149 --> 03:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
for documentation to get a license but
 
03:54:50.229 --> 03:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to C yep everybody
 
03:54:52.149 --> 03:54:52.159 align:start position:0%
goes through a process they um have to
 
03:54:54.429 --> 03:54:54.439 align:start position:0%
present documentation and then they get
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
approved by USCIS and they get either a
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
Visa a permanent resident card an EAD
 
03:55:00.670 --> 03:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
card depending on what their stat uh
 
03:55:02.590 --> 03:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
status is why they're coming here they
 
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
do get approval so when we do process
 
03:55:06.670 --> 03:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
seed licenses we actually run their
 
03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
alien number through this database it
 
03:55:10.510 --> 03:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
tells us whether they're here illegally
 
03:55:12.389 --> 03:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
or legally to actually be here to to
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions really I'm
 
03:55:21.680 --> 03:55:28.950 align:start position:0%
questions really I'm
surprised

03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.189 --> 03:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
um just in general terms going back to
 
03:55:33.910 --> 03:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
the initial statement you said
 
03:55:36.189 --> 03:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
describing legal I guess what I'm trying
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
to look at is because I've heard this
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
legal word thrown around a lot is legal
 
03:55:42.710 --> 03:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
to be here
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
legally different than being here
 
03:55:45.520 --> 03:55:46.910 align:start position:0%
legally different than being here
lawfully

03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
lawfully
 
03:55:49.110 --> 03:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
present what's the difference between
 
03:55:51.790 --> 03:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
those two
 
03:55:54.510 --> 03:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
categories I'll leave that to USCIS and
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
a constitutional attorney I don't I
 
03:55:58.269 --> 03:55:58.279 align:start position:0%

delay um I'm going to start off uh
 
04:36:07.670 --> 04:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
we've got a few bills that I've opted
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
not to bring up today so I'll list those
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%

1138 um I'm going to say 1304 as well
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
because it's a question on whether or
 
04:36:33.750 --> 04:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
not everybody has a draft
 
04:36:36.189 --> 04:36:36.199 align:start position:0%

Jones you care to speak your a motion
 
04:41:33.788 --> 04:41:33.798 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um having a 20-year
 
04:41:36.590 --> 04:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
floating time period for uh requiring
 
04:41:37.948 --> 04:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
titles makes a little more sense than a
 
04:41:40.628 --> 04:41:40.638 align:start position:0%
fixed period if you think about it in 20
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
30 40 years we're going to have vehicles
 
04:41:45.430 --> 04:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
that still require titles even though
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're basically junk and worthless um
 
04:41:50.470 --> 04:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
so going to a 20-year floating period
 
04:41:52.030 --> 04:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
just makes more administrative sense
 
04:41:54.070 --> 04:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
than what we do
 
04:41:57.150 --> 04:41:57.160 align:start position:0%
now fair enough anybody
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%

04:45:55.868 --> 04:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
zero okay the committee recommendation
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
of itl is adopted 170 do I hear a motion
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
for consent consent it is without
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
objection seeing none I'm going to close
 
04:46:07.470 --> 04:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
the executive
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
session uh next up and give us a few
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
1391

04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.548 --> 04:46:51.558 align:start position:0%
when open up the executive session on
 
04:46:54.470 --> 04:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1391 FN allowing new vehicles
 
04:46:56.430 --> 04:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
purchased in the model year or before to
 
04:46:58.030 --> 04:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
be inspected in the second year after
 
04:47:00.430 --> 04:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
purchase chair recognizes representative
 
04:47:01.628 --> 04:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
CER for a
 
04:47:03.750 --> 04:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you Mr chairman I'd like
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
to move that
 
04:47:09.310 --> 04:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 1391 for aop pass
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
second okay aop pass was moved seconded
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
by representative Hill do you care to
 
04:47:18.990 --> 04:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
speak to motion h yes sir um so 1391 is
 
04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
a common sense bill um we've looked at
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
it it uh the data doesn't support that
 
04:47:28.110 --> 04:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
there'll be any kind of impact on safety
 
04:47:30.310 --> 04:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
um you know this is something that we
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
could do small step in making a change
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
to our inspection program that uh that's
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
going to be measured and it's going to
 
04:47:39.910 --> 04:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
save our constituents a lot of time and
 
04:47:42.510 --> 04:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
um effort and I think it's uh what we
 
04:47:44.350 --> 04:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
should do and it's from the feedback
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
from my community it's what my
 
04:47:48.510 --> 04:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
constituents expect of me so thank
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
 
04:47:51.760 --> 04:47:52.990 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
representative

04:47:52.990 --> 04:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:47:55.070 --> 04:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr
 
04:47:57.750 --> 04:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um so I have a little bit to
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
say about this bill as well um I'm
 
04:48:03.510 --> 04:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to the motion um I have a bunch
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
of reasons I'm going to try and keep
 
04:48:08.390 --> 04:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
them as brief as I can um first and
 
04:48:15.628 --> 04:48:15.638 align:start position:0%
foremost um the bill is unclear about
 
04:48:15.638 --> 04:48:17.310 align:start position:0%
foremost um the bill is unclear about
how

04:48:17.310 --> 04:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
the not carrying out inspections on
 
04:48:21.750 --> 04:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are less than that are
 
04:48:24.390 --> 04:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
brand new or up to two years old and how
 
04:48:28.670 --> 04:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
that will impact on uh EPA emissions
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
questions um now
 
04:48:33.190 --> 04:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
admittedly folks will talk about how
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very small subset of the
 
04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
numbers of vehicles that are um
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
inspected but I would caution us as a
 
04:48:46.270 --> 04:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
committee to remember that
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
um when EPA standards are being
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
discussed the dep uh the Department of
 
04:48:56.470 --> 04:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services could not be def
 
04:48:58.510 --> 04:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
completely definitive about what might
 
04:48:59.868 --> 04:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
happen if we were to change the
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
inspection requirements for for this
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
these vehicles how that would impact
 
04:49:06.788 --> 04:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
their their relationships and the
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
working standards that they have with
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
the EPA in addition to that the
 
04:49:17.190 --> 04:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
um one thing that's needs to be clear to
 
04:49:19.948 --> 04:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
the committee as well is
 
04:49:23.548 --> 04:49:23.558 align:start position:0%
that the percentage
 
04:49:28.510 --> 04:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
of um greenhouse gases that come from
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
various sources in New Hampshire versus
 
04:49:33.948 --> 04:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
other states is very different uh new
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has very
 
04:49:38.670 --> 04:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
few um coal burning they do have one in
 
04:49:41.948 --> 04:49:41.958 align:start position:0%
Bow they but they have very few power
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
plants which are a big source of
 
04:49:47.190 --> 04:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
emission control which the APA does try
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
to control with scrubbers Etc um we also
 
04:49:53.830 --> 04:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
have very few um other sources of
 
04:49:56.628 --> 04:49:56.638 align:start position:0%
Industry that contribute to greenhouse
 
04:50:00.628 --> 04:50:00.638 align:start position:0%
gases so I think the number is slightly
 
04:50:03.470 --> 04:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
more than 50% of the greenhouse gases
 
04:50:05.390 --> 04:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
produced in this country are coming from
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
motorized vehicles if we take out even a
 
04:50:12.310 --> 04:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
small percentage of those
 
04:50:16.390 --> 04:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
Vehicles where will the where and the
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
EPA requires us to make up the
 
04:50:21.070 --> 04:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
difference where is that going to come
 
04:50:23.628 --> 04:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
from and no one can answer that question
 
04:50:26.430 --> 04:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
so that's one of my objections to the
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill secondly we heard testimony that uh
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
and that uh as an example rental cars
 
04:50:40.590 --> 04:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
their average use of rental cars is
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
which are primarily new vehicles um is
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
35,000 miles in a
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
year uh maybe I've got that wrong but
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I remember for two years
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
35,000 25 okay right I'll I'll take your
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
25 but I'll double it so because the
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
point is that
 
04:51:05.190 --> 04:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
um there's no restriction on this in
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
this bill for the numbers of miles that
 
04:51:10.230 --> 04:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
may occur now if you're like me and I
 
04:51:13.390 --> 04:51:13.400 align:start position:0%
would suspect the majority of uh motor
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle operators in this
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
state you don't necessarily get under
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
the hood and inspect yourself as
 
04:51:25.868 --> 04:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
carefully as you might otherwise and so
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's some there's a good chance that
 
04:51:30.190 --> 04:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
you won't even notice that you have
 
04:51:31.590 --> 04:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
problems with your vehicle that need to
 
04:51:33.310 --> 04:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
be inspected even though it's within
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
that two
 
04:51:39.628 --> 04:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
2-year possibility uh program cars um
 
04:51:41.110 --> 04:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know people who commute long
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
distances to their job they're going to
 
04:51:45.270 --> 04:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
be putting on significant miles and may
 
04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
notified sooner rather than later which
 
04:51:52.830 --> 04:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
leads to another problem
 
04:51:56.708 --> 04:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
um most car warranties I understand it
 
04:52:00.470 --> 04:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
are somewhere around 36 months 36,000
 
04:52:00.480 --> 04:52:02.110 align:start position:0%
are somewhere around 36 months 36,000
miles

04:52:02.110 --> 04:52:02.120 align:start position:0%
miles
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
nowadays okay so you go 40,000 Mi during
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
this time frame and they bring your car
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
in for inspection after the end of 2
 
04:52:12.548 --> 04:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
years which is required now and the
 
04:52:15.628 --> 04:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
garage says to you you have this problem
 
04:52:17.548 --> 04:52:17.558 align:start position:0%
with your car it needs to be fixed for
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
it to pass
 
04:52:21.948 --> 04:52:21.958 align:start position:0%
inspection who's going to pay rather
 
04:52:23.948 --> 04:52:23.958 align:start position:0%
than being covered by warranty work
 
04:52:25.750 --> 04:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to pay and I think
 
04:52:28.350 --> 04:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
that's a disservice to our
 
04:52:28.360 --> 04:52:30.070 align:start position:0%
that's a disservice to our
constituents

04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
04:52:35.070 --> 04:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
um the primary Genesis are are or uh
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
impetus behind this bill was about
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
complaints about how the inspection
 
04:52:40.798 --> 04:52:42.230 align:start position:0%
complaints about how the inspection
system

04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:52:45.670 --> 04:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
works and I will submit to you that the
 
04:52:47.470 --> 04:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles has made
 
04:52:51.708 --> 04:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
some progress in terms of making vehicle
 
04:52:57.150 --> 04:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
owners more aware that there is a a way
 
04:52:59.708 --> 04:52:59.718 align:start position:0%
a road to figure this out no pun
 
04:52:59.718 --> 04:53:01.270 align:start position:0%
a road to figure this out no pun
intended

04:53:01.270 --> 04:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
intended
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
um by changing some of the things that
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
they do um I would also submit that um
 
04:53:08.718 --> 04:53:10.190 align:start position:0%
they do um I would also submit that um
beyond

04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
04:53:15.628 --> 04:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
that um there is no data I would repeat
 
04:53:18.030 --> 04:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
again and we should be making databased
 
04:53:21.708 --> 04:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
decisions not emotional decisions there
 
04:53:25.990 --> 04:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
is no data to tell us the numbers of
 
04:53:28.830 --> 04:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
complaints about garages supposedly or
 
04:53:32.548 --> 04:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
not or supposedly I I'm being fair to
 
04:53:35.070 --> 04:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of garage does there's no
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
data that says x a number amounts of
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
complaints were received versus X number
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
amounts of inspections were
 
04:53:45.948 --> 04:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
conducted are we throwing the baby out
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
with the bath water
 
04:53:51.990 --> 04:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
because of some loud complaints for the
 
04:53:55.830 --> 04:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
a very small number of problem garages
 
04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
where the majority of those garages are
 
04:54:01.390 --> 04:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
doing their jobs as they
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
should um again no study's been
 
04:54:06.990 --> 04:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
completed to make this connection I you
 
04:54:08.670 --> 04:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
know I think that needs to be done or no
 
04:54:10.990 --> 04:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
data was presented there's been no
 
04:54:12.510 --> 04:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
actual studies
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:18.910 --> 04:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
see the connection between vehicle
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
inspections and safety now the argument
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
is that there's only a this is only
 
04:54:27.548 --> 04:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
affecting a small number of cars that
 
04:54:31.390 --> 04:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
have motor vehicle crashes related to
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
some part of the inspection process that
 
04:54:37.788 --> 04:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
failed I'll give you that but was any
 
04:54:39.868 --> 04:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
data studied to see how serious those
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
crashes were and when is it when does it
 
04:54:45.470 --> 04:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
become serious
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
enough that we should have done
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
something ahead of time and so there is
 
04:54:54.150 --> 04:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
a connection in my mind at least until
 
04:54:56.670 --> 04:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
we have real data that answers these
 
04:55:00.430 --> 04:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
types of questions um so with all of
 
04:55:02.990 --> 04:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
that in mind I would urge my colleagues
 
04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
inpire of the feel-good nature of the
 
04:55:09.750 --> 04:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill to vote against the motion so that
 
04:55:12.788 --> 04:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
another motion could be
 
04:55:14.510 --> 04:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
introduced anybody else from the
 
04:55:16.548 --> 04:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
committee representative St
 
04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you
 
04:55:23.830 --> 04:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the air
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
emissions I think that our state uh
 
04:55:30.750 --> 04:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
agency that is in charge of that has uh
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
has the capabilities to figure out how
 
04:55:36.430 --> 04:55:36.440 align:start position:0%
the other plus 30 plus states that have
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
no inspections at all can see how
 
04:55:43.510 --> 04:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
they're getting that uh enforced because
 
04:55:45.788 --> 04:55:45.798 align:start position:0%
other states have many more cars than we
 
04:55:49.350 --> 04:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
do in some cases close to a million
 
04:55:52.110 --> 04:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
maybe more cars if you look at a state
 
04:55:52.120 --> 04:55:53.590 align:start position:0%
maybe more cars if you look at a state
like

04:55:53.590 --> 04:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Pennsylvania Florida
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
Colorado uh what are they doing they
 
04:56:03.590 --> 04:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
they have the same EPA regs that we do
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh so there's something being done and I
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
would hope that uh if this build is
 
04:56:11.910 --> 04:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
advances that uh our local state agents
 
04:56:14.150 --> 04:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
will uh will look into
 
04:56:18.070 --> 04:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
that as far as a rental cars you notice
 
04:56:19.990 --> 04:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
that you go to rent a car quite often
 
04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
they have an out ofate plate there is no
 
04:56:25.868 --> 04:56:25.878 align:start position:0%
restrictions to rental agencies to only
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
rent cars in this state with a New
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plate on it so you could have
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
a car with Pennsylvania plates on it
 
04:56:34.910 --> 04:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
Colorado again Connecticut it
 
04:56:37.310 --> 04:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
Florida they're not going to have a
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
sticker on it at any mileage or any time
 
04:56:43.910 --> 04:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
so that's something to to think about
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
how we're how that's been not affecting
 
04:56:49.150 --> 04:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
us per
 
04:56:51.910 --> 04:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
se and I as far as people not looking
 
04:56:53.830 --> 04:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
under the hoods again this is I'm just
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
answering my opinion on these um new
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
cars come with this thing it can be very
 
04:57:01.150 --> 04:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
annoying it's called an engine
 
04:57:03.470 --> 04:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
light so you don't even have have to
 
04:57:05.948 --> 04:57:05.958 align:start position:0%
look under the hood because the thing is
 
04:57:08.270 --> 04:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to start telling you engine check
 
04:57:13.030 --> 04:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
oil check engine transmission low tires
 
04:57:15.948 --> 04:57:15.958 align:start position:0%
pressure we have all these gadgets now
 
04:57:17.788 --> 04:57:17.798 align:start position:0%
and for a lot of people that that is the
 
04:57:19.628 --> 04:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
wakeup call is geez I better get this
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
checked out now granted they're going to
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
be some people that say I'm never going
 
04:57:25.510 --> 04:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
to do it but they wer going to do it
 
04:57:28.310 --> 04:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
anyway I think this is a logical
 
04:57:32.350 --> 04:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
bill um and I hope that uh we vote to
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
pass it thank you
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
 
04:57:37.868 --> 04:57:37.878 align:start position:0%
representative sellers thank you Mr
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh I agree with uh representative
 
04:57:43.708 --> 04:57:43.718 align:start position:0%
St Clair and honestly I I think the bill
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't go far enough I think it's it's
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
great uh if you have the money to buy a
 
04:57:50.470 --> 04:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
new car and you don't have to get a
 
04:57:54.070 --> 04:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
sticker you save them 40 50 bucks but
 
04:57:55.830 --> 04:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see this bill actually
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
expanded but we'll take it as it is
 
04:58:01.628 --> 04:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
right now and on and looking at the um
 
04:58:04.110 --> 04:58:04.120 align:start position:0%
the percentage of
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
EPA possible issues I mean if you we
 
04:58:09.670 --> 04:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
don't I I couldn't find the number of
 
04:58:13.110 --> 04:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
cars we sell in New Hampshire but I mean
 
04:58:15.070 --> 04:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
if you if you say we're selling 20,000
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
cars a year and we have maybe 300 or 400
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
that had EPA problems that's that's
 
04:58:24.030 --> 04:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
nothing it's a drop in the bucket you
 
04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
know and as uh representative s Clair
 
04:58:28.948 --> 04:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
said that especially on the rental cars
 
04:58:31.230 --> 04:58:31.240 align:start position:0%
they come from all over you know
 
04:58:34.868 --> 04:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
so we could have you know all these cars
 
04:58:37.628 --> 04:58:37.638 align:start position:0%
from states that don't have inspections
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
and they're doing exactly what we're not
 
04:58:42.030 --> 04:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
do able to do here and they at they're
 
04:58:45.150 --> 04:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
brand new so I I I support this bill I
 
04:58:46.948 --> 04:58:46.958 align:start position:0%
think it should
 
04:58:50.910 --> 04:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
pass anybody else we Gorski thank you Mr
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
chairman um in my career I've I've had
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
the chance to buy a new vehicle and
 
04:58:57.708 --> 04:58:57.718 align:start position:0%
recently bought a certified pre-owned
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle and I heard the testimony that
 
04:59:02.788 --> 04:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
you know car can go over 70,000 mil in 2
 
04:59:05.230 --> 04:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
years years and things can happen all I
 
04:59:08.190 --> 04:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
know is when I brought my car in even
 
04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
now they put it through a 17p point
 
04:59:13.708 --> 04:59:13.718 align:start position:0%
check even if I'm doing an oil change
 
04:59:15.150 --> 04:59:15.160 align:start position:0%
and they're checking to see if
 
04:59:16.590 --> 04:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
anything's gone wrong and they're
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
checking to see to if there's anything
 
04:59:21.150 --> 04:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
that needs to be repaired and I go there
 
04:59:22.868 --> 04:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
because it's still under
 
04:59:25.510 --> 04:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
warranty so the way I look at this is a
 
04:59:27.948 --> 04:59:27.958 align:start position:0%
two-year car twoyear any new car is
 
04:59:29.310 --> 04:59:29.320 align:start position:0%
still going to be under warranty and a
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
reasonable person is going to go back to
 
04:59:34.548 --> 04:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
the dealer to do the basics and I've had
 
04:59:37.070 --> 04:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
different types of cars and every make a
 
04:59:40.030 --> 04:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
car has gone through a 17 to a 25 Point
 
04:59:42.150 --> 04:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
check because of that it's gonna those
 
04:59:43.470 --> 04:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
are the things are going to get caught
 
04:59:45.628 --> 04:59:45.638 align:start position:0%
and from that because of that I'm going
 
04:59:48.190 --> 04:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
to support this
 
04:59:51.628 --> 04:59:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:54.548 --> 04:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
else represent
 
04:59:56.830 --> 04:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
Smith yeah on the warranty thing I think
 
04:59:59.350 --> 04:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
one thing that we missed too was you can
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
do things that will void your warranty I
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
would never do that a warranty is a
 
05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing because if I bought a
 
05:00:09.948 --> 05:00:09.958 align:start position:0%
new car I would beat the well I would
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
beat something out of it in the first
 
05:00:13.390 --> 05:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
year and make them fix
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
everything one of the ways you can not
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
have the benefit of a warranty anymore
 
05:00:20.670 --> 05:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
though is not bring your car back in for
 
05:00:22.510 --> 05:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
required Services if you're not
 
05:00:25.310 --> 05:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
maintaining it properly through their
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
recommendations they will void your
 
05:00:29.310 --> 05:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
warranty so I just Lo looked up chrys
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
service schedule they
 
05:00:35.708 --> 05:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
recommend every 8,000 Mi or every 6
 
05:00:38.910 --> 05:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
months to like 96,000 Mi I I don't know
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
if they still cover things there if
 
05:00:43.310 --> 05:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're still covering things at 96,000
 
05:00:46.750 --> 05:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
Mi maybe I'll go down but like 32,000 Mi
 
05:00:51.590 --> 05:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
or 24 months um if you don't do this you
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
may have to replace your own engine or
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you break so these cars are not
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
going to be in disrepair in the first
 
05:01:01.230 --> 05:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
year because people like their warranty
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
they paid way too much money for the new
 
05:01:05.708 --> 05:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
car for the benefit of not having to fix
 
05:01:05.718 --> 05:01:06.868 align:start position:0%
car for the benefit of not having to fix
it

05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
so really what's going to happen that
 
05:01:11.110 --> 05:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
pesky check engine light comes on and I
 
05:01:12.868 --> 05:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
have a new car I am going straight back
 
05:01:15.310 --> 05:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
and I am not happy and I expect to get a
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
loner and I expect to get my car back
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
with the light out and everything fine
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
so I mean I believe there's zero risk to
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
increasing emissions through this thank
 
05:01:27.948 --> 05:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
you anybody else representative Jones
 
05:01:30.430 --> 05:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to get on this one thank
 
05:01:34.628 --> 05:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I'm just reading from
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
the position paper from the Department
 
05:01:40.350 --> 05:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
of Safety uh in brand new cars last year
 
05:01:43.948 --> 05:01:43.958 align:start position:0%
two 271 brand new vehicles were failing
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
their initial safety inspection that's
 
05:01:49.548 --> 05:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
271 vehicles that probably the owner
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
didn't even know wouldn't have known it
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
needed maintaining unless they had that
 
05:01:57.510 --> 05:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
inspection that's
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
271 could have been unsafe cars on our
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
road that could have been easily fixed
 
05:02:05.070 --> 05:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
there would have been no burden on the
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
owner because it would have fallen under
 
05:02:07.400 --> 05:02:08.628 align:start position:0%
owner because it would have fallen under
the

05:02:08.628 --> 05:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:02:10.868 --> 05:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
warrantee and one other thing I just
 
05:02:12.868 --> 05:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
want to pull from the Department of
 
05:02:16.868 --> 05:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
Safety position um the goal the original
 
05:02:20.670 --> 05:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
goal be reason for this issue was
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
complaints about the in uh the
 
05:02:26.110 --> 05:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
inspection C stations and uh it says
 
05:02:27.390 --> 05:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
here that complaints are thoroughly
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
investigated by troop by State Police
 
05:02:33.030 --> 05:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
Troop G when violations are identified
 
05:02:35.070 --> 05:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
through an audit or investigation harsh
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
penalties are
 
05:02:40.030 --> 05:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
recommended so I think uh there's some
 
05:02:43.030 --> 05:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
protections I'm I would be
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
opposed anybody
 
05:02:49.830 --> 05:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
else I'll have to add a couple of words
 
05:02:54.030 --> 05:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
myself um what's that I've been
 
05:02:57.230 --> 05:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
defending the safety program for 12
 
05:02:59.708 --> 05:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
years now and I always
 
05:03:02.150 --> 05:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
will um and I've taken my lumps for
 
05:03:04.350 --> 05:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
doing so I was originally going to rebut
 
05:03:05.948 --> 05:03:05.958 align:start position:0%
some of the things I said but I'm not
 
05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to because I think this build is
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
that easy um over the last few years
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
we've actually taken more of a turn at
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
trying to make the people hate it less
 
05:03:18.910 --> 05:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
as a way to defend it for the future and
 
05:03:21.470 --> 05:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
I look at this bill of being just that
 
05:03:22.990 --> 05:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh I've had conversations with the
 
05:03:24.708 --> 05:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles and I thank
 
05:03:26.868 --> 05:03:26.878 align:start position:0%
them for doing some of the things on the
 
05:03:28.590 --> 05:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
receipts that you get from Gordon derby
 
05:03:31.030 --> 05:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
with a phone number as almost a hotline
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
if you will to go after those shops uh
 
05:03:35.910 --> 05:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
and these are all good things to make
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
people hate it less this is just doing
 
05:03:40.510 --> 05:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
the same thing uh I think we can all
 
05:03:43.150 --> 05:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
agree Common Sense uh with these
 
05:03:45.110 --> 05:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles brand new what they cost and
 
05:03:48.150 --> 05:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
under warranty uh I don't see a major
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
problem with unsafe vehicles on the
 
05:03:52.990 --> 05:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
roads the other I did I will rebut one
 
05:03:56.830 --> 05:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
argument for some of the things that
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
failed um a safety
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
inspection most of those things I don't
 
05:04:04.788 --> 05:04:04.798 align:start position:0%
believe are covered warranty anyway um
 
05:04:06.270 --> 05:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
there's not too many warranties for
 
05:04:06.280 --> 05:04:07.868 align:start position:0%
there's not too many warranties for
atire

05:04:07.868 --> 05:04:07.878 align:start position:0%
atire
 
05:04:10.990 --> 05:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
so again I I'll leave it at that um
 
05:04:13.390 --> 05:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
let's again one more strive to make
 
05:04:15.670 --> 05:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
people hate this less and maybe we won't
 
05:04:17.110 --> 05:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
have so many bills to repeal it
 
05:04:18.270 --> 05:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
completely in the
 
05:04:21.310 --> 05:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
future thank you I encourage everybody
 
05:04:23.708 --> 05:04:23.718 align:start position:0%

this will be going on the regular
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
calendar and two off to a second
 
05:05:47.548 --> 05:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
committee as well so I'm going to close
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
the executive session on House Bill
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
1391 and just for our future planning
 
05:05:54.320 --> 05:05:57.110 align:start position:0%
1391 and just for our future planning
purposes

05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
um I will reschedule these bills
 
05:06:04.270 --> 05:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh they are early bills all these are
 
05:06:05.948 --> 05:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
the early bills and so I we'll have to
 
05:06:07.830 --> 05:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
do these the next time we come here
 
05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
which will be on the 30th uh I I think
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
we can afford to take off the week of
 
05:06:15.110 --> 05:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
the 23rd we meet on Tuesdays that's
 
05:06:17.350 --> 05:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
election day so I think we're in pretty
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
good shape to take the week off uh so
 
05:06:22.230 --> 05:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
30th is our next time here I will do the
 
05:06:24.590 --> 05:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
same thing public hearings in the
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
morning in probably a pretty lengthy
 
05:06:28.230 --> 05:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
executive session in the afternoon just
 
05:06:30.990 --> 05:06:31.000 align:start position:0%

05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
