00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
some of that is on me but you know
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get a stien back uh after

uh legislators only make $100 a year um
 
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.510 align:start position:0%
uh legislators only make $100 a year um
the

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
um we discussed it on the phone
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I do I I think we're going
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
to work on trying to get maybe a line
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
item in the budget next time in the
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
future for in case any of these um trade
 
00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
missions come up that the legislators or
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
elected officials I know if the governor
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
goes he's got his own budget but we
 
00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.309 align:start position:0%
goes he's got his own budget but we
don't

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
so if there's another um chance that
 
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
there's a trade Mission I think there's
 
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
a line item that any elected officials
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 align:start position:0%

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
$8600 appropriation or line for travel
 
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
on this particular item so none of that
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
can be used to reimburse you is that
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
what we're told oh that's a question my
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
understanding is no this is federal
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
money um so the the uh trade mission was
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
based thanks so that's correct director
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
can answer that question you're welcome
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
so can any of that money be used to
 
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
reimburse or travel no sir we we've
 
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
looked at that and it's said these are
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
federal dollars so there there are um
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
unfortunately limitations that are
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
placed on how we use those funds um and
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
they're directed exclusively at small
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
small businesses and their and their
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
costs a portion of their costs when they
 
00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.110 align:start position:0%
costs a portion of their costs when they
travel

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
travel
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
abroad but but as Senator mentioned that
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
we we did discuss some options that we
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
we could potentially look at going
 
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
forward that I think would maybe remedy
 
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
forward that I think would maybe remedy
that

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%

for something she's resent did
 
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
that I did I'm sorry I try not to copy
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
everybody but I told Mr Kane I didn't
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
want to remove it from consent anymore
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
correct you're you're correct you want
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
we got some exp repetition of the other
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
ones from the department so I no longer
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
the senator had a question the question
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
resolve the issue and now she does not
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
want to pull it okay which item was that
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%

seconds further discussion seeing none
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
are ready for the question all in favor
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
say I I oppose no we we'll first move so
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar is accepted with
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
2427 I think
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
it's what's the what's
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
the yeah
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
testing and that would be the health and
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
are Senator rosenwall did you have a
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
question I did thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
actually had a couple of questions one
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
is for
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
Dees um who sent some further
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
explanation this morning saying
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
that the the money that was appropriated
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
in 2019 for the drinking water in
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
groundwater test which I think was
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
between1 and a half and $2
 
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
million they were unable to use so they
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
ended that Grant
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
um my question is did wasn't that non
 
00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:48.430 align:start position:0%
um my question is did wasn't that non
labing

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
how where where is what is that money
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
doing now sure Senator so that's a
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
question that Dees uh Su Carlson will be
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
a to answer has to do with the fiscal
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
year 2019 appropriation from the
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
drinking water and groundwater trust
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
fund for schools was that
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
Doe um
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning um for the record my
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
name is Susan Carlson Environmental
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
Services the money that we are giving
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services is actually
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
coming from a Federal grant primarily
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
and then $400,000 from the drinking
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund the money
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
we had given the Department of Education
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
that you were referring to um that Grant
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
has been closed and was returned to the
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
money could I follow up yeah follow what
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
was the mechanism for returning the
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
money that we appropriated to the
 
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.230 align:start position:0%
money that we appropriated to the
trust

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
trust
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
the when I when I say return the money I
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
mean the Department of Education
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
um we ended the grant with them it's not
 
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
an actual cash transfer um we ended that
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
Grant with them because um of um they
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
were not spending the money and we
 
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
pivoted for the lead in schools and dayc
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
carees because of changes in law to um
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
work with Department of environment
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me of Health and Human Services
 
00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839 align:start position:0%
to deal with lead in um Child Care
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
Centers and Dees itself is handling
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
grants directly to the schools for lead
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
remediation I follow thank you could you
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
provide us with the statutory language
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
that allowed you to do that and my
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
second question is for HHS and that is
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
how many child care facilities are going
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
to receive these grants to have their
 
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:00.759 align:start position:0%
water uh drinking water sources upgraded
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
to to be led free sure good morning uh
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee my name is Ian W I'm
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
the interm director for uh division of
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services so there are 717
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
licensed uh child carees in the state of
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we anticipate up to 20%
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
may need some kind of lead remediation
 
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
activities and those would largely be
 
00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
fixture we we anticipate most of them
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
would be fixture Replacements um we're
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
hoping there aren't as many kind of
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
broadscale water system impacts
 
00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
obviously those are more costly and and
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
would impact the funds available um but
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
everyone would be eligible for these
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
funds and we anticipate it may be
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
between 100 and 150 facilities that may
 
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.470 align:start position:0%
between 100 and 150 facilities that may
need

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%

tell me until you get the money and go
 
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:43.399 align:start position:0%

commissioner and I head down uh
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman had a question on
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
this thank you Mr chairman so I see that
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
you have a remaining budget of about
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
$7.9 million and this particular item
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
expires if you will or ends in November
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
of next year are you going to be able to
 
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
spend all that money because you haven't
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
made many requests on it so far yes sir
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely I the the the issue has
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
been the design of the programs that we
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
are going to be bringing forward we have
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
to have those approved by the economic
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
development Administration so that's a
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
back and forth so as we get those
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
approvals we bring them here but we have
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
programs that are going to be showing up
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
over the next couple of months that will
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
get us on track to have those funds
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
spent well in advance of November of
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
chairman further questions I'd move the
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
item representative leishman moves
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
24003 seconded by Senator gray any
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none you ready
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
for the question all in favor say I I
 
00:22:58.269 --> 00:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
oppose no 24003 is adopted we're moving
 
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.000 align:start position:0%

245 Department of Health and Human
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
Services and I have down that uh
 
00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has a question uh
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um it's good to be
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
back it's been 7 months so I hope I
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
remember how to do this but um I um I
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
specifically would like to get an idea
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
24005 uh under class
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
101 it it describes that the funds will
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
be used for U Medicaid Care Management
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
capit ation payments fee for service uh
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
provider payments uh
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
DCF uh Behavioral Services for clients
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
enrolled in uh New Hampshire's Medicaid
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
Program so um keeping in mind that I'm
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
for a full education on this I just
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
would like to understand better at maybe
 
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:24.440 align:start position:0%
a Layman's
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
language what this money is is going to
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
be spent on is this is this money going
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
to be spent because we've had increased
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
volumes is it going to be uh added to re
 
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
um reimbursement rates is it something
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
that we've actually have already owed
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
and this is going to give us an
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to pay it just where where
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
does this money go sure um Nathan white
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
Chief Financial Officer held and Human
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
Services uh so I'm just going to back up
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
a little bit to put some of this into
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
context so this item is similar to an
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
item that was approved by this committee
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
last February um what we are approving
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
here this is this is met this is
 
00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
additional met Revenue um when the
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
department budgeted last year or in the
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
summer of 2020 um that was obviously a
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
challenging time for many and when we
 
00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:22.120 align:start position:0%
budgeted our Revenue within our Medicade
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
program account and so this is the 7948
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is the Medicaid Care Management
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
account this is the account from which
 
00:25:30.909 --> 00:25:30.919 align:start position:0%
we and and class line in this specific
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
case from which we pay um our per member
 
00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
per month rates we pay our fee for
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
Service rates so to directly answer your
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards this
 
00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
would be pay these funds would be
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
supporting the existing Medicaid Program
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
and the existing payments that that we
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
have the reason why you're seeing $39
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
million here this was $1 million in the
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
prior year is because when we made our
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
our Dish payment payments and that's
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
part of the larger disproportionate
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
share hospital um program in the prior
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
year we earned an additional 5% federal
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
funds that we Norm in a normal world we
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
would not have otherwise so we were able
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
to earn additional federal revenue
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
additionally going back to the summer of
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
2020 when we originally prepared the
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 23 budget um we
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
budgeted conservatively because the met
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
the the Met revenues it's a 5.4% tax on
 
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
net patient service Revenue we assumed
 
00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
at that point in time that Hospital's
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
net Patient Service Revenue was probably
 
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
going to be lower um that it we we had a
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
slightly different experience obviously
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
than than what we anticipated in that
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
year but in uh for example in 2021 the
 
00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
Met Revenue came in at 248 million and
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
by state fiscal year 2023 met Revenue
 
00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
was at 301 million um so so Statewide we
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
saw a large increase in that and so
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
today we're asking you to allow us to
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
accept these funds into the standard
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget and this budget is Carri
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
forward from year to year uh it doesn't
 
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
lapse at the end of the bium um and this
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
would allow us to make provider payments
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
and if there are changes un you know
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
unpredicted changes um in enrollment
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
numbers or utilization um these funds
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
would would be used to pay for that but
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
they would not to answer your question
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
directly they would not be used to pay
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
for rate increases that was a separate
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
trch of funds um that this committee
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
already discussed back in
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
October followup followup question uh uh
 
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr White um for being gentle
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
with me on that so um what what I'd
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
still like to come back to is um a
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
commitment that was made uh when we were
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
all negotiating in good faith with each
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
other on on uh um Monies to be allocated
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
to the Medicaid reimbursement rate
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
increases and uh in a in I think in an
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
act of nobility the hospital system
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
stepped forward and said that they would
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
defer their share of a Medicaid
 
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate so we could
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
distribute it far further across the the
 
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
community to help others and I'm just
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
curious if uh it happens that this met
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
money is uh going to be um an
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
anticipated benefit to the hospital
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
system that would rightly deserve it but
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious where where we are in
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
terms of keeping track of um our
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
commitments and
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
Promises does that make
 
00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:48.039 align:start position:0%
sense is this is this met money going to
 
00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
the hospitals no so the the the Dish
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
payment um program that that's that's
 
00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
articulated within the 2018 settlement
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
agreement and RSA
 
00:28:59.950 --> 00:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
um those payments are based on the
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
methodology specified therein um this
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
These funds would not be used to
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
increase those payments These funds
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
would be used to pay for and support the
 
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.509 align:start position:0%
would be used to pay for and support the
Medicaid

00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
Program all right uh thank you with I'm
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
satisfied I think Senator Rosenwald may
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
have a question Senator Rosenwald for
 
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you following up on
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards though don't the
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
hospit hospitals account for the
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
majority of
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid claims or a huge chunk of it so
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
won't some of those increased provider
 
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
payments ACR to the
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
hospitals the even though we didn't give
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
them a rate increase the the the the
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
payments are based on utilization so it
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
it would be based on where the need is
 
00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.750 align:start position:0%
it would be based on where the need is
like

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
there this is essentially going into our
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
larger Medicaid a program account 7948
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's one of the largest accounting units
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the state um and it's used to support
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
that program so I I don't see any direct
 
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
relationship or incentive or causality
 
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
associated with this accept an expend
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
and and any outcomes associated with
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
what what you were indicating Senator
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
Rosen wal fur question thank you so the
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have this pretty
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
significant excess met
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
Revenue has has the
 
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
department tried to figure out to what
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
extent it's caused by increased
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
utilization and to what extent it's
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
caused by increased
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
prices I would have to check with the
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid team to know if they've
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
conducted that kind of level of analysis
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
at this point though I'm not aware of
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
one but Henry limpin just stood
 
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
up try to help good
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
observation good morning for the record
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
Henry Litman the state's Medicaid
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
director so the the Met tax money that
 
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
funds the dish that the the arrangement
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
that is codified in 2018 House Bill 1817
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
we F fulfilled that completely Our
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
obligation on that um in terms of this
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
um additional met tax it was expected to
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
cover things
 
00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the enrollment um other
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
growth and services but in terms of your
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
directly on your question um we saw
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
typically the Met Revenue has been
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
growing in more typical years between
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
three and 7% um is what what we see net
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
Patient Service Revenue growing in the
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
hospitals that drives the tax collection
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
to go up um but keep in mind the reason
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
some of this is continually
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
appropriated just one example is um as
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
we look at next year we have um
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
identified at least
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
66 um new Gene therapies and and drugs
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
that are potentially coming at the
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program um some of them um you
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
know we think in the end we probably
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
about 31 will come in the next
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
year when I say these 31 they have a
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
minimum cost of
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and some um like for example
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
the the one on sickle cell anemia the
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
prices on those are 2.1 and three
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
million there is a rebate that we get on
 
00:32:36.149 --> 00:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
it but you know in terms of the 39 39
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
million is a big uh dollar amount but
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
some of the uncertainties in terms of
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
where spending is going to go as a
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
result of these types of things that
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
that's I think why the past legislature
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
has given um some difference to this
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
additional money because we have
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
enrollment um variation which has been
 
00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's settling down more to what
 
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
we expected right now um but all these
 
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
other things coming at us that that's
 
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
why I think that money is intended to
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
support that and you know other
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
utilization changes as uh as uh Nathan
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
helps thank you director any further

request if you could provide us some
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
future point of a breakdown of the claim
 
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
sizes you know are they all coming in
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
one and a half million or some of them
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of between zero a half a

million that kind of thing just get an
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%

such as by the Attorney General's office
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
or through resolution proceeding whether

it's zero to 100,000 awarded 100 to some
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%

information thank you all

right you don't have any more questions
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
no no I'm done all right someone had a
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
question on

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
representa Edwards is recognized for a
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair um this
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
is a report that uh I've seen in various
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
iterations over the last couple of years
 
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
and one of the takeaways of this report
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
tends to be that the legislature has
 
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
once again um fully appropriated all the
 
00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
money that would be necessary to have a
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
zero weight list and it's been a long
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
time since I've had an opportunity to
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
ask qu the question is though is um how
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
are we doing on the ground I know that
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
we've appropriated all the money um I'm
 
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
glad we've done that and we've done that
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
for two or three years now but the
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
question that I had asked um
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
periodically was uh are all of the kids
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
who are eligible for services actually
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
receiving them we we we used to have a
 
00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
gap between the kids that we had money
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
for and the kids that had providers
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
because not everybody had the providers
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
they needed so we were long time ago
 
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
looking for a metric to give us some
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
idea of how healthy we are at
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
kids um thank you for the question um
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um for the record
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
Chris santinello associate commissioner
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
this report here is geared towards the
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
child care Development Fund funding and
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
children needing access to a subsidy um
 
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
we don't have a um collect a weit list
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
for children who who do not receive
 
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
these funding who are looking for
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
placement in a child care
 
00:39:06.309 --> 00:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
setting so so let me restate that
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
because I think I understand you but
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
what I think I just heard you say is um
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have any kids that are
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
eligible that don't also have a a
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
matching to a provider at this point we
 
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.430 align:start position:0%
matching to a provider at this point we
don't

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
have data we don't have any children who
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
are eligible for the child Child Care
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship funding who are waiting for
 
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.870 align:start position:0%
scholarship funding who are waiting for
that

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
funding so that's that's all good news
 
00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
right there's nothing hidden in there I
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
should be picking on that sounds all
 
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:39.640 align:start position:0%
good I don't think so I mean but this is
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
funding and so I
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
think yeah well and the funds if they
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
don't get used they they're non-aps are
 
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.550 align:start position:0%
don't get used they they're non-aps are
they

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.150 align:start position:0%
they
not

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
the I the federal funds carry over
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
year to year okay um and then I think I
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
had another question um we changed the
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility for this program in hb2 I
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
believe um and we were curious what the
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
status is on the eligibility update so
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
that just went into effect um January
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
1st January 1 it went into yes so I
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
don't really have data on that you just
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
did that was the answer okay thank you
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
perfect yeah okay um that's all the
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions I have on this that's all okay
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
all right do you have one anybody else
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
have any questions on this item thank
 
00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
you I think we also have
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
2426 yes sir we had question from I
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
think Senator
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
Six

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
Six
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not hearing you with your mic
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
off I also had questions on the
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
litigation fund but while the department
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
is here I had a
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
question about the the
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
dashboard the long-term care program the
 
00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:19.030 align:start position:0%
dashboard the long-term care program the
CFI

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
CFI
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
numbers which were projected to rise and
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
be just under 6,000 and have continued
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
to fall and are
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
currently this fiscal year and last
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year below where they were pre
 
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the nursing home bed census
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
is also down versus goal so my question
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
is where's the bottleneck in the
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
department and and what is the
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
department doing
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
to um get more more
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
people uh provided with the services
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for and are approved
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
for thank you for the question um I'm
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
Melissa Hardy I'm the division director
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
for long-term supports and services so I
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
think a couple of things um that we're
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
doing to to increase the supports in the
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
community Through the CFI program one is
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
the legislation in hp2 for the system of
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
care for healthy aging um looking at
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility um requirement ments and how
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.109 align:start position:0%
you any further questions on that item
yes

00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
sir representative Edwards um thank you
 
00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:33.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um there's there are some
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
tables here that paint a potentially
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
interesting short story um tables um one
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
two three uh where it looks like the
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
amount of workload going through
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid has been
 
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
dropping quite a lot and I know some of
 
00:43:58.829 --> 00:43:58.839 align:start position:0%
this is from the Department's efforts to
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
um um modify
 
00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility but is there more going on
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
to Behind These charts that would
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
present a couple of sentences of a short
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
story well the on on page one t table
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
one that that's that's referring to the
 
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
total count um on page two if if you're
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
looking at Medicaid case loads I mean
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing there is the
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
unwind um that's the significant drop
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
that that we're seeing there um
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
utilization in tanif I mean that's
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a downward Trend there for
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
quite quite some time so I'm not I'm not
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily drawing any other
 
00:44:43.069 --> 00:44:43.079 align:start position:0%
conclusions there what what what were
 
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
you thinking representative efforts well
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just seeing a a kind of an
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
unexpected to me drop in Medicaid
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
utilization and and some of it seems to
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
be associated with with the unwind but
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if there's something
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
deeper beneath the the the the
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
decline uh that would indicate a
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
healthier population or a population
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
that's harder for us to access or you
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
know I'm it just it just alerts me that
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
something seems to be odd no I I mean
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
the the unwind trans that took period
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
over a period of 9 10 12 months or I
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
guess not quite 12 but um that's been
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
going on for a period of time that's why
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
we see a slow gradual um decline there
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
but B basically what what we're seeing
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
like in standard Medicaid is a return to
 
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
you know pre pandemic levels so I I I
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
mean Henry litman's here he can
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
certainly speak to it more in depth but
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not aware of anything unusual
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
there ju just shake your head if you
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
think that there's something more
 
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
unusual going on there otherwise I'll
 
00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
unusual going on there otherwise I'll
leave

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.670 align:start position:0%
leave
it

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
we we can we can talk later I want to
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
talk to you about Opthalmology
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
anyways uh all right and then uh I would
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
like to jump forward to Table Six this
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
is the U
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
cunu U
 
00:46:16.829 --> 00:46:16.839 align:start position:0%
Services and in the last six orth six
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
months or so uh we've been hitting an
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
average daily census of 18 pretty
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
commonly and this makes me
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
nervous because um I I thought we were
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
going to be able to build the new cunu
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
center uh with
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
18 realizing that 18 was a maximum
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
number that we needed in a flexible
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
situation but if but logically if we're
 
00:46:47.549 --> 00:46:47.559 align:start position:0%
at 18
 
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
regularly then we've given up our
 
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility and and we may be in sort of
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
a red situation already I'm I'm curious
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
what you what you think did did I screw
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
up by not telling you to build 20
 
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:05.240 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
18 uh good morning uh Marissa hen Deputy
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
Commissioner uh for the record it's
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
really Mr ribson by the way Miss yeah we
 
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:17.559 align:start position:0%
screwed up it's oh oh we can blame it on
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
our dcyf predecessor so um you are right
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
that the census at syc has been high for
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
the past year um part of that seems to
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
be due to some of the changes in what
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing around Juvenile Justice
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
related to um Gang Related activity and
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
also the number the seriousness of
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
crimes is resulting in more youth being
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
committed meaning they're spending
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
longer sentences versus that short
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
detention period so there's been a bit
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
of a shift just in the overall landscape
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
of Juvenile Justice not only in New
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but in other states um so
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
we're doing a number of things in
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
response to that because it has been
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
made uh exceedingly clear to us not just
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
last session but for many sessions that
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
18 is the limit for the um New YDC build
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
so the things that we're doing are first
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
of all we're working to actually
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
continue to drive that number down by
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
doing all the preventive Upstream work
 
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
of getting kids and fam services that we
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
know make a difference um I won't detail
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
those for you but you've you've heard me
 
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
talk about them before um the second
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
thing is we're working with the court
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
system to say what should we do in that
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
situation we're obviously still a couple
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
years out from the new YDC being
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
um you know accepting youth but we need
 
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
to be prepared so those are essentially
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
what we're doing we're working to to uh
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
to lessen the actual um uh demand and
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
then we're actually working in the event
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
that the the demand exceeds Supply um
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
working with the court system who are
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
the only ones who can order youth to the
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh YDC in the first place to say um what
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
would we do in that situation because
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
the the future build is um an 18 Max
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.950 align:start position:0%
 
exception

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
question follow up follow up so it it
 
00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
seems like the trend in the growth is in
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
the uh detained youth
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
column and and that the committed youth
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
column is has been pretty stable for
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
quite some time and so is it the court
 
00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:18.799 align:start position:0%
system that may be able to work with you
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
the most to influence the detained youth
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
or is that all prescribed by law um so
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
essentially when I'm referring to the
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
increase in committed I'm comparing it
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
to last year at this time when you see
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
the number was around two or three and
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
now is around six so it's really that
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
change from a year from when the
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
legislation passed where we had a census
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
I think of around uh 12 um on average to
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
that that higher number so so the
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
problem with committed and detained and
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
actually we're in the process per a
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
really thoughtful request from
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative wner to update this to
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
show um the cumulative number of
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
admissions because looking only at
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
detained or committed is a bit of a
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
misleading snapshot the detained youth
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
are sometimes only there for a couple
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
days a few weeks the committed youth are
 
00:50:08.349 --> 00:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
often there for years um sometimes the
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
the uh remainder of their minority um so
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
so I think the the answer to your
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
question is we are seeing an increase
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a change in the composition
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
in population this isn't just New
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is happening regionally
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
and nationally um and yes it requires
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
working with the courts because DHHS
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
can't actually decide who goes to YDC um
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
we uh rely on the courts and working
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
with the courts to make those
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
determinations based on very strict
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
criteria I I appreciate your answer
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
chair senator birdell for a question
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
thank thank you taking my question um
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that the YDC the the new
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
YDC is going to have an 18 bed Max is
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.119 --> 00:51:00.750 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
thanks so again I think that the
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
situation is one of it's not entirely up
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
to just DHHS um even now let's say um
 
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
there was a major incident you know of
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
an array of criminal activity that
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
resulted in 10 kids being sent to syc
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
today we could not accommodate that with
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
our staffing with our facility with our
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
ability to meet federal regulations for
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
separating youth um in a way that's safe
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not it's never out of the
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
question that the um demand for services
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
could exceed Supply and I think it would
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
require um just careful conversations
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
with the courts to say we have to come
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
up with Alternatives we have to find
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
ways to get some of these youth into
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
residential treatment we have to make
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
sure all of them are actually
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate um and can't be served
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
elsewhere don't require psychiatric
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
treatment so so it's never it's not like
 
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
the possibility isn't always there um I
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
think we're taking it much more
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
seriously given the concern that you've
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
raised that we're we're awfully close to
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
now any further questions from committee
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
much if there's no further questions on
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
the informational items we'll move on to
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
the I'm sorry Senator rosemal yes I had
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
a question on the litigation report from
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice okay I see the
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%

00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
to oh it's number 2434 under tab 11 yeah
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely good morning um um
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
page three of the 2023 report yep I just
 
00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:49.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you about two items there
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
are no line numbers but they're the two
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
expensive it items the first one is GK
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
at all versus Christopher sonunu at all
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
is that an ER boarding case no Senator
 
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839 align:start position:0%
that that is that's not ER boarding this
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
is um a class action that was brought
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
against uh the state by four uh four
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
youth who are in foster care but but
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
have um have mental
 
00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities so they that is basically a
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
challenge to
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
how whe whether the state is doing what
 
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
it needs to be doing under the law to
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
provide services for kids who might be
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
in foster care that that have mental
 
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities okay thank you yep and um
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
my second question is down almost at the
 
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.950 align:start position:0%
my second question is down almost at the
bottom

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
investigation YDC it's $1.9 million are
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
those the criminal cases or is that yes

yep thank you yep
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
chairman representative lean for a
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
question thanks Mr chairman and thanks
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
for being here you do a staggering
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
amount of work which is obvious by these
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
two documents you've given us so I had a
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
couple of questions um one I saw the
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
conille line was about $850,000 is that
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
where does that stand now is that under
 
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
stay is it being repealed yeah so it it
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
well right now we filed the motion for
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
reconsideration but we we anticipate
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
that going up on appeal and we do not
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
expect the costs on appeal to be
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere close to what the costs were to
 
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
prepare the case for trial and actually
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
try the case okay thank you and just one
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
other question Mr chairman follow up I
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
saw a couple of Liquor Commission items
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
where you were involved are you being
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by The Liquor Commission for
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
that any of that litigation
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
or I I don't believe we get reimbursed
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
no we just we represent every everyone
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
we we used the litigation fund for for
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
that okay was something that former
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ober and I were always
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about that um the litigation
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
at least from The Liquor Commission
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't being reimbursed to the euro
 
00:55:09.599 --> 00:55:12.470 align:start position:0%
wasn't being reimbursed to the euro
office

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
but yeah so so um uh Kathy Carr was just
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
saying they do pay into swab for civil
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
so so they do like every other agency
 
00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:22.839 align:start position:0%
sort of sort of pay in and there are
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
shared costs for an agency like ours
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
that that serves every agency in state
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
government so there is that
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement that is sort of the same
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
as as other agencies but there's no
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
direct reimbursement we don't Bill The
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%

um related to the required supplementary
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
information that's an in relation to
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
opinion and that in required

supplementary information is the mdna
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
and the OPB and pension
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
schedules what that means is that we
 
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
subject the information in within those
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
three schedules to our audit procedures
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they were presented
 
00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
fairly presented fairly in all material
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
respects with the audited financials
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
we have on Slide Five of our
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
presentation our required um
 
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
communication summarized there and I
 
01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
just went through the key points that I
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to present now jumping to slide
 
01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
seven um we have noted three uncorrected
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
audited adjustments and no corrected
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
audit adjustments these three um
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
management was aware of of and they
 
01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:21.640 align:start position:0%
primarily relate to Corrections of
 
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
errors that were identified to ensure
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
that the financial stat for the current
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
year and going forward are
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
accurate we have received
 
01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
representations from management and
 
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
concur that the effect of these
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
uncorrected financial statements and
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
related counseling and disclosures are
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
immaterial to the users both
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
individually and in the
 
01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
aggregate if you will know on slide
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
eight we did not identify any material
 
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
weaknesses we do aine on internal
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
controls as relate to financial
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
reporting and material weakness with
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
would be the most severe level of a
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
breakdown of internal control so that is
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
a testament to your internal control
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
structure here at the state we did
 
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
identify one significant deficiency
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
which is a slight carryover from the
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
previous years as relates to the
 
01:01:12.029 --> 01:01:12.039 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation trust fund it
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
relates to the reconciliation of their
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
acrs on an annual basis that when I say
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
acrs I mean their acrel accounts
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the year they're on a cash
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
basis and at year end they'll they'll go
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
through a process of preparing for acral
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
reporting and it's the timeliness of
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
reconciling those accounts that we
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
reported on management is in concurrence
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
with that and continues to make efforts
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
to ensure they have the proper levels of
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
Staffing and support to be able to
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
perform those reconciliations in a
 
01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:40.750 align:start position:0%
perform those reconciliations in a
timely

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
timely
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
manner we have issued a report on
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
internal controls over financial
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
reporting and compliance and other
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
matters on the audit of the financial
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
statements prepared in accordance with
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
governmental auditing standards within
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
that report we do identify that there
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
were no material weaknesses in internal
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
controls and we identify that one
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
significant deficiency I am the lead
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
partner on the federal single audit and
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
I'll be presenting to you in April this
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
letter will be included within the
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
federal single audit report that gets
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
filed with the with the federal
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
government the report um and lastly the
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
one I additional item I want to
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
highlight is that there were no dis
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
disagreements with management and there
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
was no significant dis difficulties
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
during the audit I felt that we had a
 
01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
very strong working relationship and
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
Open Candid conversations and I do
 
01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that of management um to feel
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
confident in providing you with that
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
this opinion over the basic financial
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
statements does anyone have any
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
you director commissioner
 
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
just I I won't belabor things but um
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
we've had a good relationship Marie was
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually the lead partner of my first
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
audit as commissioner and then she went
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
away and then she came back so that's a
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's a good sign I think I'm not sure
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
um uh we worked very uh closely and
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
cooperatively with both KPMG and LBA but
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure to uh to thank um we
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
have a very strong accounting staff um
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the state and in accounting services
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
and and you all know the com troller
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
very well but I want to make sure I
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned um Scott Egan who's our
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
director of financial reporting who's a
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
newer employee who did Yan's work on
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
this um so many times when I when I
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
stopped by the third floor would wander
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
down because there was only one light on
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
um late at night and hopefully he's
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
occurring lots of comp time um which is
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
a grand thing but and and Cat Bogan and
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
Deputy comproller um Karen Burke as well
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
so we have very good staff who did a
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
very good job on this um and it's why
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
the results are as good as you see and
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%

01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
the report on internal control over
 
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
financial reporting and compliance
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
and the third is um the debt compliance
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
letter and before I go through each of
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
those uh quickly I just wanted to um
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
congratulate Danielle and her team for
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
all their efforts um during the audit
 
01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
there a lot of lot of time spent uh
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
compiling the financial statements uh
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
timely and accurately so uh just wanted
 
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
to uh congratulate uh Danielle and her
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
team um with respect to uh the financial
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
statement opinion um that opinion
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
indicates that uh management is
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
responsible for the fair presentation
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
and uh accuracy of the financial
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
statements and KPMG is responsible for
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
expressing an opinion on the financial
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
statements um we conducted our audit in
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
accordance with generally accepted
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
auditing standards as well as Government
 
01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.630 align:start position:0%
auditing standards as well as Government
auditing

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
auditing
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
standards and that report uh also
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
references uh the report on internal
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
control of financial reporting which I
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
indicated earlier was the second report
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
in your uh materials that uh yellow book
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
report indicates that there were no
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
significant deficiencies or material
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
weaknesses identified uh during the
 
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
course of the audit so again um
 
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
congratulations to Danielle and her team
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
um and then the last report in your
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
materials the debt compliance report uh
 
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
indicates that we reviewed the
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
provisions and Covenants within the bond
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
resolutions and determined that uh the
 
01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:20.839 align:start position:0%
turnpike system was in compliance uh
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
with those Provisions um so all good
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
news to report with respect to uh the
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
reports that you have in front of you um
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
in addition I will cover the required
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
Communications um to the committee so uh
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
there were no uh significant or unusual
 
01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
transactions that we identified during
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
the course of the audit uh there was one
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
uncorrected misstatement uh which
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
relates to a nog Gap policy which is
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
consistent with uh uh uncorrected
 
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
misstatement that we have identified in
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
the past related to the allocation of
 
01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
the net other post-employment benefit
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
liability um so the state does not
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
allocate The Trusted OPB um plan
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
liability to the Enterprise funds and
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
the Turnpike being one of those so um
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
again that's it's about a million dollar
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh net pension liability that was not
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
allocated so that was one uncorrected
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
misstatement that we identified there
 
01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:17.239 align:start position:0%
were no corrected uh misstatements that
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
we identified during the course of the
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
audit um again there were no U material
 
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
weaknesses or significant deficiencies
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
identified uh we did discuss uh the
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
significant accounting policies which
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
are disclosed in the notes of the
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
financial statements uh with management
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
during the course of the audit um and
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
determined that they were reasonable in
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
addition we evaluated the uh significant
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
accounting estimates uh during the
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
course of the audit uh which included uh
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
the valuation of Investments uh the
 
01:08:48.269 --> 01:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
valuation of the toll receiv receivables
 
01:08:51.870 --> 01:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
allowance as well as uh acrs of expenses
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
and also determine those to be re
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable um there were no actual or
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
suspected uh illegal acts that we
 
01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
identified during the course of the
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
audit uh there were no subsequent events
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh that we
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
identified uh no non-compliance with
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
laws or regulations uh no significant
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
difficulties that we encountered during
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
the audit um management did not uh
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
consult with other accountants uh that
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
we are aware of uh there were no uh
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
difficult or contentious matters that we
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh dealt with during the course of the
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
audit uh no disagreements with
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
management during the course of the
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
audit um and we are independent of the
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
turnpike um as well so with that um
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for prepared remarks
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%

on the lottery commission's basic

the notes and other supplementary
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
information while our opinion speaks
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
directly to the basic financial
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
statements and notes no matters came to
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
our attention that caused us to believe
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
that other information in the financial
 
01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
section of the report was inconsistent
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
with the basic financial
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%

01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%

not go through each of them individually

increase they remarkable ability
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
um um essentially everything working
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
well um and um you take advantage of
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
natural occurrences right so Powerball
 
01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
had a good year because interest rates
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
went up yeah and so jackpot sizes went
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
up because jackpots are a factor of cash
 
01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
on hand times the bond factor which is
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
essentially interest rates that being
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
said New Hampshire was number one in the
 
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
country of Powerball sales so
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
yes it was a natural occurrence a
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
Tailwind but also we took remarkable
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
advantage of the Tailwind so um you know
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
the more I prepare you know the more I
 
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
prepare the better luck we have so
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
anyway and sports betting also we're
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
number two in the country of sports
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
betting profitability for the state
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
so yes we have natural occurrences yes
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank the Dallas Cowboys for
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
losing because that alone um and
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
I I reminded commissioner capatos that I
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
thanked him personally and said we owe J
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
Jones a fruit basket so
 
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh anyway so number of good factors
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%

result of our audit while our opinion

statements auditing standards require
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%

stores and keeping everything moving any
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
challenges ahead that you
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
see well I think that you know we had
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
some challenges uh at the end of the
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
last fiscal year the weather wasn't
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
great we didn't have a great summer uh
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
we lost some of our large volume sales
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
from across but we're we're adjusting
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
our prices we've got some major
 
01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
competition in Massachusetts with Total
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
Wine building eight stores there since
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
2016 uh so uh but we are doing our best
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
and we're up about
 
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
13 13 million thus far this fiscal year
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much Mr
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
chairman Senator alisandra thank you Mr
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's
 
01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
remarkable that the commission has done
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
as well as it has given the level of
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
competition I don't know how many of you
 
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
get the globe and listen to public our
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
public radio where where the competition
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
is advertising against us on our own
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
public system that's that's damn
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to deal with and and I think
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
the commission does a terrific job in in
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
sustaining its profitability and and
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
doing it doing the job properly so kudos
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
to the commission and everyone involved
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm I'm very very concerned about
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
the future based on a the level of
 
01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
competition the fact that that the the
 
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
competitive the competitive Advent that
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
we once held doesn't really exist
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
anymore it's only through the efforts of
 
01:22:57.870 --> 01:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
the commission that we sustain but
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
competition is severe at at this point
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
in time and this uh this local wine
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
situation that's a massive Corporation
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
massive Corporation and as I say they're
 
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're uh attacking us so kudos for the
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
job well done thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
you further from the
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
committee senator Rosal thank you what's
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
the vacancy
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
rate in your
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
stores from an employee standpoint uh
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're actually in pretty good shape
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
right at the moment the vacancy rate is
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
very low uh We've
 
01:23:43.229 --> 01:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
basically uh given the 10% and we're our
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
opening uh salary is
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
1564 now so we've found that to be very
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
competitive and we've seen a lot of
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
people come back to the market that come
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
back to the part-time labor market that
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
weren't there as well as the incentive
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
program which has worked wonderfully
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
which is drawing some folks back to us
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't get incentives in these
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
positions in these retail positions in
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
other markets so thank you thank you
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
Senator I think that's worked out well
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
where you expanded your hours with
 
01:24:19.149 --> 01:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
part-time people they were happy to get
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
the jobs and your customers were
 
01:24:23.629 --> 01:24:23.639 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to get there in late
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
hours and on weekends so that was that
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
was a a big step appreciated that you
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
very much represent further from the
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
committee Senator Ro
 
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.830 align:start position:0%
committee Senator Ro
Senator

01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
bdel just a comment Hamstead would like
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
back it's all a matter of volume we
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
we're hoping everybody loves the new
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
Dairy Store Senator thank
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%

01:24:55.270 --> 01:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
Lehman well hearing Senator delis
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
Sandro's comments I just uh guess I'm
 
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:02.440 align:start position:0%
looking for how are we going to deal
 
01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
with this declining Revenue based on all
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
the competition you're getting do you
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
have a plan in place or because
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
obviously it's having an impact on your
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
revenues well it hasn't had necessarily
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
had an impact in the revenues this year
 
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
going forward you were seeing it there
 
01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
what we've done what the plan is to do
 
01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:25.719 align:start position:0%
is to do greater discounting what we've
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
seen from Total Wine is you know they'll
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
literally on National Brands they'll
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
work on a penny a bottle two cents a
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
bottle uh they're a a private label
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
retailer so they'll work on 50 or 60%
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
markup on their private labels and give
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
away the national brand so by
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
discounting additional discounts uh from
 
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
15 to 20% Which has only driven our
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
gross profit down about a quarter of a
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
percent thus far given that we started
 
01:25:58.030 --> 01:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
this program in July and we've run it
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
through uh we're seeing uh those folks
 
01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
come back to us and buy here so it's
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
costing us a quarter of a percent to
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
become more aggressive across the border
 
01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
and you know we have to we also have to
 
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
be concerned with the three states
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
around us that have cannabis because
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
there's additional funds there's only so
 
01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
much funds that people have to spend
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
on uh you know these types of things and
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that in the three states
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
around us we're do they're doing just
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
under $2.5 billion doar in cannabis
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
sales Massachusetts did 1.75 billion
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
last year so the type of discretionary
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
income that normally would have been
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
spent on alcohol uh is being spent on
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis and when you see the Baby
 
01:26:49.149 --> 01:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
Boomers moving out of the market there
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know the the folks born from 46 to
 
01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
64 are moving out of the alcohol Market
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
the people moving in behind them the
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
generations behind them are buying less
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol and they're buying more cannabis
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing a split in that Revenue
 
01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
being spent uh which is affecting the
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol business overall worldwide and
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
Nationwide we have a glut of wine in
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
France that they're pouring down the
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
drain they're pulling up they're pulling
 
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
up vines in Spain and in in in South
 
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
America America and they're planting
 
01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
other crops because the the folks that
 
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
the Baby Boomers that drove the alcohol
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
market for many years are now aging out
 
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
and the people behind them don't drink
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
at the same pattern so it's something
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
that we're we're we're we realize and
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's something that we're working on
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
aggressively thank you Mr chairman
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
pleasure so Mr chairman I guess we ought
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
illegal Ro
 
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.910 align:start position:0%
illegal Ro
[Laughter]

01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.350 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
a

01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
CL no he obviously has some challenges I
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
wonder if this U new business in
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts can sustain the low prices
 
01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.510 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts can sustain the low prices
they

01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:28:13.910 --> 01:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
have well being a national chain uh they
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
have they're in 24 25 States now they
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
have uh about 260 stores and uh you know
 
01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:24.199 align:start position:0%
they're they're running somewhere just
 
01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
under $4 billion in sales they have
 
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
13,000 employees Nationwide so they're
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
you know they're a big company and a lot
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
of the national National suppliers don't
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily like what they're doing with
 
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
dropping those prices and building a
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
knockoff brand against them but they're
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
such a huge brand that you cannot do
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
business with them so it's kind of
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're you're caught between a rock and
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
a hard place if you're uh if you're a
 
01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
national supplier and so you have to do
 
01:28:58.910 --> 01:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
business with them the the The Sweet
 
01:29:01.629 --> 01:29:01.639 align:start position:0%
Spot for us is knowing that they do not
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
they do not have the type of inventory
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
that we have so when we put something on
 
01:29:09.790 --> 01:29:09.800 align:start position:0%
sale we have tens of thousands of cases
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
to back that sale up they clearly do not
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
that they don't have that and they never
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
have so they disappoint consumer after
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
consumer that comes to those stores
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
looking for that for those products at
 
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
that price they may have six or seven
 
01:29:28.430 --> 01:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
bottles so at at that particular price
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
and what we've seen in Massachusetts is
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're offering those low prices but
 
01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
they'll be doing it in P particular
 
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
stores sometimes they'll say only
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
available in natic only available in
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
shoes Berry so they're they're moving
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
consumers around they're you know
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
they're playing a shell game with
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
consumers and we as a business do not do
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
that and I think our consumers are
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
responding to it aren't they paying hire
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
tax on wine and
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
mass well I think in general there
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
there's no sales tax on alcohol anymore
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts it's been dropped it
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
was something that they put in place and
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
then they pulled away but there's talk
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
of it coming back and Praise Jesus that
 
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.590 align:start position:0%
of it coming back and Praise Jesus that
it

01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
does knowing the history of that state
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
as we do I think the taxes will go
 
01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
back representative Earth thank you Mr
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
chair could you speak to the increased
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.550 --> 01:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
23 those are primarily uh due to
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits and our contracts
 
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
and rents for um our locations so the
 
01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
rents have increased for the additional
 
01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
Square footages for the new locations
 
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
that we've brought
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
on by 25% no but then there's the salary
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
and benefits are increase in debt so
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
there's many different factors that um
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
drive those cost up and do you expect
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
that to be the same going forward the
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
same kind of increases going forward um
 
01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
not to that same level but we do have
 
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
the increase this year for the um pay
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
raise that went into effect the 10% pay
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
raise thank
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
you anything
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
further represent lean just backing up
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
to the last response that national chain
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
with a 260 some OD stores how Clos are
 
01:31:23.830 --> 01:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
are they like in methu or at Kingsboro
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
are they right on the border now
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%

01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
in naq was their first store uh but they
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%

Northborough line and everything else is
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%

Island border to our border and they've
 
01:31:59.229 --> 01:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
kind of controlled that and it's caused
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
