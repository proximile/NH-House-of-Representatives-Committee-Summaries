rescheduled this is a revenue estimates
 
00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 align:start position:0%
meeting the legislative revenue
 
00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 align:start position:0%
estimates by addition that was developed
 
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 align:start position:0%
in the early 1970s are handled
 
00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 align:start position:0%
differently from regular legislation
 
00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 align:start position:0%
they end up as a house resolution which
 
00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 align:start position:0%
never leaves the house usually the
 
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
resolution finishes each year dying on
 
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
the table but it forms the sense of the
 
00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 align:start position:0%
house as to where the state's revenues
 
00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 align:start position:0%
will end up and provides a measure of
 
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 align:start position:0%
how bad or good our revenues are
 
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 align:start position:0%
we need to cut spending or take other
 
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 align:start position:0%
preventative measures or have extra
 
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
money for new ideas growing needs or
 
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
savings when the Senate considers these
 
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 align:start position:0%
issues it usually starts from the House
 
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 align:start position:0%
estimates and they are inserted mostly
 
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 align:start position:0%
intact into budget bills as conditions
 
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
change the Ways and Means Committee
 
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
reconsiders the estimates puts up a new
 
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
pillow or it takes the old one off the
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
table amends it and then puts it back on
 
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 align:start position:0%
the table because of this sentence
 
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 align:start position:0%
scenario we do not start with a drafted
 
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 align:start position:0%
resolution today this is the second year
 
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
the first one died on the table
 
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 align:start position:0%
we start with prior year's revenues
 
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 align:start position:0%
agency or of course research economists
 
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
chambers of commerce and our own
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
personal experiences and training we've
 
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
been working on redoing the budget
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
estimates since the kovin shutdown began
 
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
as individuals in caucuses in small
 
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 align:start position:0%
groups and finally when able in public
 
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 align:start position:0%
session together today we will vote on
 
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
the final estimates for the fiscal year
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
that is ending and the one that begins
 
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
July 1 there is still considerable
 
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 align:start position:0%
unknowns about what June's revenues will
 
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 align:start position:0%
bring us and many more unknowns for the
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
coming year as a result most of our
 
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 align:start position:0%
estimates this time will be in ranges
 
00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
our committee has a tradition of working
 
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
on these estimates bipartisanly and we
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
representative major I'm here by myself
 
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
in plasto representative Griffin I'm
 
00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:21.380 align:start position:0%
here and wind him alone all the way I'm
 
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:30.130 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:34.790 align:start position:0%
see you but I did not hear an answer use
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:41.980 align:start position:0%
see you but I did not hear an answer use
me

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.010 align:start position:0%
it looks like representative Lang
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
representative Lang I am traveling in
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
upstate New York and I am alone
 
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:54.290 align:start position:0%
representative you said President Salem
 
00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
alone representative Edwards I'm in
 
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:02.180 align:start position:0%
Auburn and my wife will be moving in and
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
out of the room and background and two
 
00:10:09.519 --> 00:10:09.529 align:start position:0%
dogs I'll keep them quiet represented
 
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
bursting I'm in beautiful Nottingham New
 
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:27.110 align:start position:0%
beautiful new action and the 118 I count
 
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:32.180 align:start position:0%
18 present two absent thank you and one
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
of us has fallen off again but well hope
 
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
that he gets back ok so we are going to
 
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
have a couple of changes from the way
 
00:10:47.439 --> 00:10:47.449 align:start position:0%
we've been doing things before for those
 
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:50.270 align:start position:0%
of you who weren't here before we
 
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:53.900 align:start position:0%
started on this we are going to have to
 
00:10:59.680 --> 00:10:59.690 align:start position:0%
do a vote on every single revenue option
 
00:11:06.579 --> 00:11:06.589 align:start position:0%
that we that we consider on and decide
 
00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:11.329 align:start position:0%
to take a vote on so it's going to take
 
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
quite some time probably to get through
 
00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:17.350 align:start position:0%
some of these particularly the the
 
00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.060 align:start position:0%
business taxes and the medicine rooms
 
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:28.220 align:start position:0%
tax which are fairly far apart and what
 
00:11:34.439 --> 00:11:34.449 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do first is to take ten I
 
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
believe it's ten at this point revenues
 
00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:44.029 align:start position:0%
and fill them in on the chart with a
 
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:46.660 align:start position:0%
split screen that Chris Shea will put up
 
00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:51.949 align:start position:0%
one by one and then see if everybody is
 
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:54.470 align:start position:0%
willing to take a joint vote on those
 
00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:00.949 align:start position:0%
and get them out of the way does anybody
 
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:03.020 align:start position:0%
have an objection to that procedure I
 
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.110 align:start position:0%
think it sounds highly well-organized
 
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:09.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm grateful for your efforts and
 
00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sure representative majors - yes
 
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:14.780 align:start position:0%
representative nature and I though I
 
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.190 align:start position:0%
just realized this problem this morning
 
00:12:28.889 --> 00:12:28.899 align:start position:0%
we discussed it a bit so so crochet
 
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:32.670 align:start position:0%
would you split the screen and put up
 
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:38.430 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimate sheet spreadsheet
 
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:43.660 align:start position:0%
and list off one by one and we can go to
 
00:12:48.179 --> 00:12:48.189 align:start position:0%
those and fill them in okay you should
 
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.170 align:start position:0%
see it now mm-hmm so represent a major
 
00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
would you like to start the filling in
 
00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:12.009 align:start position:0%
of this perhaps set a major yes there
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
you are we'll start with the insurance
 
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:34.350 align:start position:0%
tax yes and the insurance tax take
 
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:38.860 align:start position:0%
agency estimates for FY 2020 which is
 
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:43.420 align:start position:0%
one thirty three point nine man follow
 
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
the high in the low and for twenty one
 
00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:49.389 align:start position:0%
one twenty eight point two million for
 
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:53.980 align:start position:0%
the high end the logs could I interrupt
 
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.689 align:start position:0%
the high end the logs could I interrupt
here

00:13:56.689 --> 00:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:02.589 align:start position:0%
I'd like well maybe we should ask Chris
 
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:05.980 align:start position:0%
about this on there are certain taxes
 
00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:11.709 align:start position:0%
where we agreed when we were discussing
 
00:14:12.929 --> 00:14:12.939 align:start position:0%
this before
 
00:14:17.369 --> 00:14:17.379 align:start position:0%
that we want to take the agency estimate
 
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:20.860 align:start position:0%
and the agency estimate is in this form
 
00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:25.029 align:start position:0%
in rounded to the hundred thousands or
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
at least when we do it it's rounded to
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
the hundred thousands when it's over a
 
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
the hundred thousands when it's over a
hundred

00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:31.369 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:36.470 align:start position:0%
and it's not the agency estimate I would
 
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.110 align:start position:0%
like to see us rounding to a million
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
unless the whole revenue source is under
 
00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:46.189 align:start position:0%
such as the beer taxes is under 50
 
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:51.170 align:start position:0%
million I don't know if everybody is is
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
in agreement with that the idea would be
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
to show this this is an estimate with
 
00:14:59.889 --> 00:14:59.899 align:start position:0%
considerable questions to it but it
 
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:03.970 align:start position:0%
would change the final result someone
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
could I have a comment by Chris Shea on
 
00:15:10.449 --> 00:15:10.459 align:start position:0%
what your you can provide whatever
 
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.110 align:start position:0%
estimates you would like represent
 
00:15:16.989 --> 00:15:16.999 align:start position:0%
follow me so if you wanted round to the
 
00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:18.709 align:start position:0%
insurance for instance excuse me the
 
00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:20.269 align:start position:0%
yeah the insurance we're just talking if
 
00:15:24.879 --> 00:15:24.889 align:start position:0%
you want to say 134 up 133 nine that's
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
the company's prerogative to do that yes
 
00:15:31.329 --> 00:15:31.339 align:start position:0%
so typically in the past you have always
 
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:35.410 align:start position:0%
gone to the the 10th if there is a yes
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.050 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with a 10th well when it's
 
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:49.550 align:start position:0%
the agency's estimate I guess that's a
 
00:15:51.129 --> 00:15:51.139 align:start position:0%
better thing but if we're doing
 
00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:53.569 align:start position:0%
something like saying we have a range
 
00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:58.540 align:start position:0%
between five hundred and sixty-eight
 
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:02.990 align:start position:0%
point two million and seven hundred and
 
00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:08.269 align:start position:0%
twenty point six million that seems a
 
00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:14.209 align:start position:0%
little bit - okay I thought we were
 
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:17.540 align:start position:0%
discussing right now we are right now I
 
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:29.110 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring that up early the
 
00:16:34.179 --> 00:16:34.189 align:start position:0%
agency estimate with the the point will
 
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:42.850 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:47.810 align:start position:0%
why okay let me just do the insurance
 
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:51.470 align:start position:0%
tax again yeah well round to a hundred
 
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
and thirty three point nine it's both
 
00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:00.339 align:start position:0%
high and low for the FY 2010 fight 21
 
00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:06.189 align:start position:0%
one twenty eight point two a high in law
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
do you want me to continue our white so
 
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.510 align:start position:0%
Susan comes back I have a that has the
 
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:41.570 align:start position:0%
once we agreed on to know so why don't
 
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
we we just go back and and forth the
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
next one is the communication services
 
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:56.510 align:start position:0%
tax that's gene and the house estimate
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
is thirty nine point seven for the first
 
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:09.710 align:start position:0%
year high and low and and thirty eight
 
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.070 align:start position:0%
point eight million for the second year
 
00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:21.500 align:start position:0%
high and low unless those any objections
 
00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
will just continue yes Brahmi has his
 
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:33.140 align:start position:0%
hand raised I'm not sure if what what he
 
00:18:43.299 --> 00:18:43.309 align:start position:0%
needs from a DUI mutant tell us what
 
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:52.950 align:start position:0%
your hands about rounding thing
 
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:54.990 align:start position:0%
so but some of these we are gonna have
 
00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:58.890 align:start position:0%
Rangers correct yes okay yes these are
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
the ones that essentially with them
 
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
because the agency suggested them as
 
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:11.970 align:start position:0%
single numbers and and all of us seem to
 
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
think that the number was as reasonable
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
as as we were going to get they're
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
usually their taxes that are or revenue
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
sources that are usually pretty well
 
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
estimated by the agency can be estimated
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
easily by the agency I agree when we get
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
to fishing game and like we should
 
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
public a lot to decimals but that's just
 
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:39.650 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:46.590 align:start position:0%
okay those revenues that were grand with
 
00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
the agencies right and and none of these
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
have ranges and we want to do is discuss
 
00:19:59.240 --> 00:19:59.250 align:start position:0%
them all at the same time like a
 
00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
consensus the agenda salt the next one
 
00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:17.889 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:22.549 align:start position:0%
Court starts and the communication tax
 
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
then I did the communication sticks and
 
00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:31.899 align:start position:0%
you you do the courts okay the court
 
00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:35.059 align:start position:0%
came in at twelve point three five I
 
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
would recommend twelve point four for
 
00:20:48.009 --> 00:20:48.019 align:start position:0%
high and low range for fy2008 point zero
 
00:20:52.899 --> 00:20:52.909 align:start position:0%
for the high-rent I mean the the low low
 
00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:58.100 align:start position:0%
range for twenty one and nine point zero
 
00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559 align:start position:0%
for the high range but twenty one nine
 
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:12.740 align:start position:0%
point one would be the rounding okay
 
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:17.630 align:start position:0%
nine point one yeah yeah makes very
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
little difference but I think that nine
 
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.460 align:start position:0%
point one for the high range for FY
 
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
point one for the high range for FY
twenty-one

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:27.070 align:start position:0%
twenty-one
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and that leaves me to do
 
00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:39.429 align:start position:0%
securities which would be forty three
 
00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:44.539 align:start position:0%
they rounded themselves 43 for the low
 
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:49.730 align:start position:0%
and high range or twenty and 43 for the
 
00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:54.500 align:start position:0%
low and high range for twenty-one on the
 
00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:03.019 align:start position:0%
beer tax the high and low range for
 
00:22:06.399 --> 00:22:06.409 align:start position:0%
twenty twelve point eight and the high
 
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.110 align:start position:0%
and low range for twenty one twelve
 
00:22:17.529 --> 00:22:17.539 align:start position:0%
point nine yes and for other which is
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:43.900 align:start position:0%
okay so the vote being 17 to zero our
 
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:46.820 align:start position:0%
consent calendar consisting of the
 
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:48.830 align:start position:0%
revenues for insurance communication
 
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:51.890 align:start position:0%
services tax court securities beer other
 
00:30:55.419 --> 00:30:55.429 align:start position:0%
to echo settlement utility property
 
00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.010 align:start position:0%
texts statewide property tax and
 
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:04.220 align:start position:0%
recoveries passes so now we will go on
 
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:15.590 align:start position:0%
to discuss the the business taxes and we
 
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:22.400 align:start position:0%
are it it sounds like were we're sort of
 
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:24.830 align:start position:0%
in we we are at least overlapping a fair
 
00:31:30.279 --> 00:31:30.289 align:start position:0%
amount let's put it that way and what
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do is suggest a
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
couple of alternatives and then discuss
 
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
them and then see if we want to add a
 
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:45.860 align:start position:0%
third or more or yet another alternative
 
00:31:53.409 --> 00:31:53.419 align:start position:0%
and on vote on all of those in see if we
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
can get to a vote that has the majority
 
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.130 align:start position:0%
of the people present for one of them
 
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:05.270 align:start position:0%
and that and the one that has the most
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
votes it's somewhat like what we do with
 
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.250 align:start position:0%
our usual straw votes but it's going to
 
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:14.510 align:start position:0%
take longer so I would like to start out
 
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:19.580 align:start position:0%
by recommending a range for business
 
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.090 align:start position:0%
taxes for the year 20 and I think we
 
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:25.490 align:start position:0%
should do 20 and 21 separately on this
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
should do 20 and 21 separately on this
one

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:25.850 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:30.500 align:start position:0%
on the year twenty on of six hundred and
 
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:33.770 align:start position:0%
seventy eight million to seven hundred
 
00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:38.450 align:start position:0%
and twenty-two million and we are using
 
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.010 align:start position:0%
rounding to the to the million mark
 
00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:44.630 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about very large
 
00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:46.460 align:start position:0%
amounts of money and huge amounts of
 
00:32:48.989 --> 00:32:48.999 align:start position:0%
uncertainty so six hundred
 
00:32:57.209 --> 00:32:57.219 align:start position:0%
seventy-eight low to 722 high and if you
 
00:33:00.689 --> 00:33:00.699 align:start position:0%
can all note those down because we're we
 
00:33:03.119 --> 00:33:03.129 align:start position:0%
I don't think Chris is going to want to
 
00:33:07.529 --> 00:33:07.539 align:start position:0%
put in individual he doesn't have a
 
00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:11.889 align:start position:0%
place to put in options so represented
 
00:33:14.969 --> 00:33:14.979 align:start position:0%
major would you like to represent a
 
00:33:25.489 --> 00:33:25.499 align:start position:0%
range 420 you're muted there you go okay
 
00:33:29.189 --> 00:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
range 420 for the business taxes six
 
00:33:35.369 --> 00:33:35.379 align:start position:0%
thirty six to seven 1600 right now I'm
 
00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:42.909 align:start position:0%
looking at the six thirty six to seven
 
00:33:49.739 --> 00:33:49.749 align:start position:0%
sixteen yes yes Epson balmy yes on the
 
00:33:52.109 --> 00:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
shear screener you're able to see below
 
00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:54.129 align:start position:0%
where I've added you arrange and rip
 
00:33:57.479 --> 00:33:57.489 align:start position:0%
some majors range oh very good thank you
 
00:33:58.579 --> 00:33:58.589 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:34:08.749 --> 00:34:08.759 align:start position:0%
everybody can see that right so where
 
00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:13.529 align:start position:0%
could we I would like to have
 
00:34:18.419 --> 00:34:18.429 align:start position:0%
representative Ames discuss the low and
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
reasons for the low and high on the
 
00:34:27.089 --> 00:34:27.099 align:start position:0%
Democratic side and represent major can
 
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:30.490 align:start position:0%
can present or ask someone else to
 
00:34:33.269 --> 00:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
present the reasons for low on and high
 
00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
present the reasons for low on and high
on

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:43.210 align:start position:0%
on the Republican side and see if we can
 
00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.290 align:start position:0%
come up with a joint alternative names
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:55.210 align:start position:0%
okay I hadn't been anticipated being
 
00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:57.129 align:start position:0%
called on in this manner but I'll do my
 
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:05.020 align:start position:0%
best so no that's fine so I want to
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
start by saying that we're dealing with
 
00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:15.910 align:start position:0%
tremendous uncertainty and even even
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
though they're in fiscal year twenty
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
were really at the nearly at the end of
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
the year there's still uncertainty and
 
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:28.710 align:start position:0%
that uncertainty in the business taxes
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
derives in part from the novelty of the
 
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:42.190 align:start position:0%
Javad virus economic circumstances that
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
we're living through but also and
 
00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:53.250 align:start position:0%
related is the decision by DRA who
 
00:35:59.339 --> 00:35:59.349 align:start position:0%
allowed a deferral of payments from the
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
deadlines that had been in place in
 
00:36:07.859 --> 00:36:07.869 align:start position:0%
April to mid June so a couple of month a
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks from now payments will
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
have come in that ordinarily would come
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
in in April and those payments will make
 
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:22.930 align:start position:0%
all the difference they will shed a lot
 
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:26.890 align:start position:0%
of light on this situation we're talking
 
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:34.270 align:start position:0%
about right now the FY 2013 said what we
 
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:37.660 align:start position:0%
know about business tax is historically
 
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
is that a big chunk of the in fact
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
almost all of the
 
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:53.150 align:start position:0%
payments in June the revenues that come
 
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.210 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:03.110 align:start position:0%
estimated payments on the expected tax
 
00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:05.630 align:start position:0%
that will be due at the end of the year
 
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:07.460 align:start position:0%
these are called if we call them
 
00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:15.020 align:start position:0%
estimates and the the it's almost as
 
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:17.780 align:start position:0%
maybe ninety five percent or perhaps
 
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:19.580 align:start position:0%
even a little higher than that sometimes
 
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:23.930 align:start position:0%
our estimates in this year so estimates
 
00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
relate to at least in theory to the
 
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:31.610 align:start position:0%
expected tax liability for the current
 
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:35.690 align:start position:0%
year and so they are likely but not
 
00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:39.950 align:start position:0%
necessarily to reflect covin however
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
many taxpayers in the ordinary course
 
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
pay estimates based on last year's tax
 
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:53.740 align:start position:0%
taxes and if that behavior continues
 
00:37:59.050 --> 00:37:59.060 align:start position:0%
then over it doesn't really affect in a
 
00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:11.270 align:start position:0%
significant way okay thank you Tom but
 
00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
so so I guess what I want to get to is
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
that there's uncertainty and then the
 
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:20.300 align:start position:0%
other end there are it's uncertainty
 
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:22.250 align:start position:0%
related to estimates and the other point
 
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:27.830 align:start position:0%
is that given the deferral ad by by D
 
00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:30.290 align:start position:0%
are a significant revenue is going to
 
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:32.750 align:start position:0%
come in this month that ordinarily would
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
come in in April we don't know how much
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
that is a lot of it will be related to
 
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:44.540 align:start position:0%
to payment of tax on activities that
 
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:46.790 align:start position:0%
occurred last year
 
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:49.370 align:start position:0%
DRA has estimated about forty eight
 
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:53.180 align:start position:0%
million dollars will come over and we
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
will receive in in June I have no
 
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:00.710 align:start position:0%
question - no no basis for questioning
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
question - no no basis for questioning
that

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:02.450 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:06.940 align:start position:0%
number and so I think we're left with
 
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:14.900 align:start position:0%
with estimating how much of the usual
 
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:19.790 align:start position:0%
estimates will be paid in and Joan
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps also where we need to question
 
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:26.870 align:start position:0%
the 48 million dollars that the RAS
 
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:28.490 align:start position:0%
estimating would come over and perhaps
 
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:32.330 align:start position:0%
some taxpayers simply won't pay because
 
00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:37.970 align:start position:0%
of the circumstances they're in so given
 
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:49.210 align:start position:0%
all that the the low range that that
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about is its 678 636
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no getting confused here 678
 
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:09.470 align:start position:0%
and that is essentially what DRA has
 
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:14.630 align:start position:0%
estimated that the low and we think
 
00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:17.690 align:start position:0%
that's about as low as this going it
 
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:19.670 align:start position:0%
could possibly go so that's why we put
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
that in I'll be interested to hear what
 
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
the basis for the lower number of 636 is
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
in the other proposal on the high end
 
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:37.070 align:start position:0%
722 represents a assumption that all of
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
dr a's estimated revenue from april will
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
in fact four over into and be received
 
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:49.180 align:start position:0%
in june so the april revenues would be
 
00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:52.460 align:start position:0%
we'd get an add-on of about 48 million
 
00:40:59.170 --> 00:40:59.180 align:start position:0%
dollars and then the additional money
 
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:04.610 align:start position:0%
that we see coming in in in june would
 
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:10.610 align:start position:0%
be would represent estimates plus about
 
00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:13.250 align:start position:0%
five million dollars i think or roughly
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
five million dollars i think or roughly
that

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:14.890 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:17.660 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous revenues from tax returns
 
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:26.510 align:start position:0%
and audits less less refunds and it
 
00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:32.930 align:start position:0%
would reflect I think a reduction of the
 
00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
usual estimates that we think we would
 
00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:38.210 align:start position:0%
get by about fifteen percent so all of
 
00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:43.340 align:start position:0%
that brings us down to the high number
 
00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:47.300 align:start position:0%
that's in the Omni range of 722 that's
 
00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:52.340 align:start position:0%
roughly the story and that represents
 
00:41:57.850 --> 00:41:57.860 align:start position:0%
our my thought anyway on how this these
 
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:02.930 align:start position:0%
numbers might materialize thank you and
 
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:06.530 align:start position:0%
that's that yes fifteen percent that's
 
00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:09.890 align:start position:0%
the way we were working it out yesterday
 
00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:13.700 align:start position:0%
I do have representative streams hands
 
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:17.660 align:start position:0%
up hand up he was involved in reworking
 
00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:20.930 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I'd like to recognize him
 
00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:25.100 align:start position:0%
before I recognize represented Burstyn
 
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.050 align:start position:0%
who is also got his hand up okay thank
 
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:31.460 align:start position:0%
you I guess
 
00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:35.180 align:start position:0%
adding to what representative Ames had
 
00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:39.470 align:start position:0%
to say and adding and adding in my own
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
thoughts as well here is what we know
 
00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:45.860 align:start position:0%
that we know we know what the numbers
 
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:47.810 align:start position:0%
delivered to date are that we've already
 
00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
taken in about five hundred and seventy
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
three million dollars of business taxes
 
00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:54.860 align:start position:0%
so if we have no money in June that's
 
00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:56.900 align:start position:0%
where we'd end up
 
00:42:59.560 --> 00:42:59.570 align:start position:0%
we know that many businesses are filing
 
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:04.010 align:start position:0%
later as representative instead and we
 
00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:07.070 align:start position:0%
hope in June where originally they would
 
00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:11.390 align:start position:0%
file in April we know that last year was
 
00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:12.380 align:start position:0%
a good year for the New Hampshire
 
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.010 align:start position:0%
economy and likely for businesses we
 
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:19.290 align:start position:0%
know the business tax rates were reduced
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know that we've been running about
 
00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
three percent under forecast before the
 
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
corona virus hits here's what we think
 
00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:32.970 align:start position:0%
we know we know we have a number from
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
DRA of about 48 million that was
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
normally would have come in April that
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
is now expected in June and we think we
 
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:44.670 align:start position:0%
know that what the forecasted amount for
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
June would be for delay in filing had
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
not occurred and that number was
 
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:54.510 align:start position:0%
approximately 142 million so so that
 
00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
those are some things to work with a
 
00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:58.590 align:start position:0%
base assumptions what we don't know is
 
00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:01.890 align:start position:0%
whether business filing the estimated
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
taxes that would come in in June and
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
take into account the impact of kovat or
 
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're just filing based on last year
 
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:13.830 align:start position:0%
and safe harbors we don't we some
 
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:15.990 align:start position:0%
businesses may file in July rather than
 
00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:18.770 align:start position:0%
June that that would really mess us up
 
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:21.450 align:start position:0%
but to what degree the state will count
 
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
the live filing returns for this year's
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
even if they come after the end of the
 
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:30.810 align:start position:0%
year or something else so you know
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
basically when I look at 48 million and
 
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:38.850 align:start position:0%
then you know the normal 141 million
 
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:41.010 align:start position:0%
that people would file in June if things
 
00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
were normal and we reduced that by about
 
00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:45.270 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:50.190 align:start position:0%
oh you know we're looking at even
 
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
numbers that are a little higher you
 
00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:55.070 align:start position:0%
know I would say that's an optimistic
 
00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:58.290 align:start position:0%
scenario that gets us to around 7 130
 
00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:02.430 align:start position:0%
million in the high end and you know I I
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
don't see us with already at five
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy three million I
 
00:45:12.859 --> 00:45:12.869 align:start position:0%
don't see us collecting 63 million
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
dollars in June when normally we would
 
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
have collected a hundred and forty forty
 
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:21.210 align:start position:0%
two million plus we have the monies from
 
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:24.210 align:start position:0%
April being delayed I just don't see you
 
00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:26.910 align:start position:0%
know kind of you know only getting 33
 
00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:28.340 align:start position:0%
percent in the amount
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
that would seem to be you know a no
 
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.090 align:start position:0%
coronavirus estimate for this point so I
 
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:43.300 align:start position:0%
think the the the representative Army's
 
00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:46.730 align:start position:0%
low-end numbers are are more realistic
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
meaning I think there's you know less
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
than a five percent chance the numbers
 
00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:52.850 align:start position:0%
will come in below that amount and I
 
00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:57.650 align:start position:0%
think there's you know a five percent
 
00:45:59.260 --> 00:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
chance the numbers might even be above
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
730 million so I don't know if he need
 
00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:05.330 align:start position:0%
me to go through the math a little bit
 
00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:08.060 align:start position:0%
more but where 572 now we got one month
 
00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:11.900 align:start position:0%
left and the two components are going to
 
00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
be the gene estimated filings and the
 
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
annual returns that haven't been
 
00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:23.030 align:start position:0%
submitted yet that come in June so that
 
00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:25.820 align:start position:0%
was kind of the process and you know
 
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
when I boiled it down to we all boiled
 
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.010 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:36.260 align:start position:0%
thank you I just like to make sure we're
 
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:40.970 align:start position:0%
using the same numbers on Devanagari
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
case sent to us on Friday night which
 
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:48.050 align:start position:0%
was the their end of the month for the
 
00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:52.370 align:start position:0%
month of May on a document on the
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
business tax analysis document says that
 
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:00.650 align:start position:0%
they and many with year-to-date 579
 
00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:04.820 align:start position:0%
point five which is somewhat higher than
 
00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:07.430 align:start position:0%
what you were using
 
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I have 573 so I appreciate
 
00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:13.670 align:start position:0%
that that was where what we had before
 
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
but on maybe we should bring in briefly
 
00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
from the audience I can't remember
 
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:27.260 align:start position:0%
whether Devin Devin is is in there and
 
00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:33.020 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rollins is in there so that they
 
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:37.190 align:start position:0%
can confirm to us although
 
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:38.630 align:start position:0%
representative I'm here this is Devin
 
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:41.900 align:start position:0%
Roderick from Department of Revenue
 
00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um when when I printed out
 
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:52.410 align:start position:0%
your NHD are a business tax analysis
 
00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:56.850 align:start position:0%
sheet that you sent Friday night it said
 
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:02.970 align:start position:0%
that for the month of for the end of the
 
00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:09.330 align:start position:0%
year FF YTD net if I'm reading that
 
00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:13.590 align:start position:0%
correctly on this year we have five
 
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:15.690 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy nine point five
 
00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
million is that recessionary yes just so
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
you know Melissa Rawlins is also unmuted
 
00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:29.130 align:start position:0%
she has her hand up okay so let us know
 
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
where she was if she had some
 
00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:33.150 align:start position:0%
information for you as well so just as
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
you're asking your question right so
 
00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:41.420 align:start position:0%
should I on ask her to come up first
 
00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:44.250 align:start position:0%
she's available to speak yet her her
 
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:47.670 align:start position:0%
she's unmuted and she can respond now if
 
00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:58.170 align:start position:0%
she would like okay okay okay yes sure
 
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:01.350 align:start position:0%
um the difference between two numbers
 
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:03.450 align:start position:0%
that you're speaking about one with the
 
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
neutral dr a business tax analysis that
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
Devon had sent down that number is just
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
a breakdown of document types but it
 
00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
does not include adjustments adjustments
 
00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:18.210 align:start position:0%
are typically bounced checks not
 
00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:24.150 align:start position:0%
supplied payments seven number should be
 
00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:30.630 align:start position:0%
using five seventy three million is
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
adjust Menemsha ideally business tax
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
analysis is gross deposits okay so we
 
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:43.100 align:start position:0%
should be using five seventy three point
 
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:47.550 align:start position:0%
points what point seven one seven thank
 
00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:47.930 align:start position:0%
points what point seven one seven thank
you

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:51.150 align:start position:0%
and that's the number from the FY 2010
 
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:53.670 align:start position:0%
are a daily cash revenue report that
 
00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:54.870 align:start position:0%
sent along with the monthly
 
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:01.530 align:start position:0%
quartz on Friday okay it's good so this
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
is fugitivity adjustments that you
 
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:06.140 align:start position:0%
normally get bounced checks and
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
something else that I missed yeah I mean
 
00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:12.770 align:start position:0%
miss apply payments mystified payments
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
that have to come out cut okay so so our
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
number is approximately six million
 
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:31.590 align:start position:0%
higher for the high end if we calculate
 
00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:36.290 align:start position:0%
it the way we calculated it yesterday
 
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:42.270 align:start position:0%
which was to take the June 19 s Timofey
 
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:47.910 align:start position:0%
Minh which were 105.9 add 5% for all the
 
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
other money that comes in and out and
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
then take a 15% loss of estimate
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
payments in 2020 June bringing it down
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
to ninety four point five million and
 
00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:11.490 align:start position:0%
which would give us a two in total of
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
142 point seven million and a high
 
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:18.810 align:start position:0%
estimate on which has to go down five
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.059 --> 00:51:38.069 align:start position:0%
17 million point for on representative
 
00:51:46.579 --> 00:51:46.589 align:start position:0%
streams estimate going up to 7:30 I'm
 
00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:48.990 align:start position:0%
not quite sure how he got to that using
 
00:51:57.799 --> 00:51:57.809 align:start position:0%
a twenty percent loss but on the 20
 
00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:00.329 align:start position:0%
percent loss when I had calculated it
 
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:03.510 align:start position:0%
out as I recall was another three or
 
00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:09.890 align:start position:0%
four million or something like that so
 
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
we on we want to L&amp;D want to talk before
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
norm talks absent of bursting you know
 
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
norm talks absent of bursting you know
yeah

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:25.730 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
representative majors before I make my
 
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:30.510 align:start position:0%
comments many myself already addressed
 
00:52:35.779 --> 00:52:35.789 align:start position:0%
by representative string them but right
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
and Romney is put his hand up do you
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
want to and I I don't were being unmuted
 
00:52:53.299 --> 00:52:53.309 align:start position:0%
from afar but looks like we have to keep
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
on hitting ourselves yes so my only
 
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:02.250 align:start position:0%
thought is you know your range you're
 
00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:09.150 align:start position:0%
using the da's rain estimate basically
 
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:20.490 align:start position:0%
your low end of a range mind as well so
 
00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:24.750 align:start position:0%
that's fun and now can come talk to this
 
00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:28.230 align:start position:0%
uh discussion around the the large
 
00:53:32.059 --> 00:53:32.069 align:start position:0%
companies you know just not paying and
 
00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:34.950 align:start position:0%
taking the penalty then we have a
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:40.770 align:start position:0%
whether or not when the audits done at
 
00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:42.510 align:start position:0%
the end of the you know that their
 
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:44.730 align:start position:0%
adjustments what takes up revenue put it
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
where it should be and so that's kind of
 
00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:56.930 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:01.650 align:start position:0%
low end that much that it was gonna be
 
00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:08.670 align:start position:0%
that rosy but yeah one thing that hasn't
 
00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:12.930 align:start position:0%
been mentioned and that is due to the
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic well most of your business is
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
out hurting you big businesses as well
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
as small business and what's keeping
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
them afloat be able to have cash and my
 
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:33.210 align:start position:0%
feeling is is they're going to hold on
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
to their cash as long as possible in
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
order to be able to survive this hasn't
 
00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:41.910 align:start position:0%
been taking into account yet and that's
 
00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:44.430 align:start position:0%
one of the factors that we're down to
 
00:54:59.089 --> 00:54:59.099 align:start position:0%
the six thirty six I can easily and as
 
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:03.930 align:start position:0%
far as the panel take me that cash can
 
00:55:07.339 --> 00:55:07.349 align:start position:0%
come from two ways one is not paying the
 
00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:10.130 align:start position:0%
taxes that they had anticipated and
 
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
defer them as long as possible into
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
twenty-one or really scraping the barrel
 
00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:20.339 align:start position:0%
for their credit carryover using the
 
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:22.770 align:start position:0%
credit carryover from right here they
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
used about 75% of the DQ and we're up to
 
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:30.030 align:start position:0%
about two hundred and seventy million
 
00:55:37.039 --> 00:55:37.049 align:start position:0%
dollars so he did and 25% of of that is
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
about better than sixty million dollars
 
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
and if they use what they able to scrape
 
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
up their top of that thirty name they
 
00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:50.380 align:start position:0%
will be doing that
 
00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:52.530 align:start position:0%
and then that's in the basis of
 
00:55:58.350 --> 00:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
contributing to our lower number thank
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
you Mon could we hear again from Melissa
 
00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:13.050 align:start position:0%
about on the idea that the credit on
 
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
clarify for us exactly what the credit
 
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
clarify for us exactly what the credit
carry-forward

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:18.490 align:start position:0%
carry-forward
 
00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:27.850 align:start position:0%
is does it include business enterprise
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
tax payers that have not been paying
 
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:38.770 align:start position:0%
business profits tax but have a right to
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
credits for it if they do so what the
 
00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:46.390 align:start position:0%
credit carryover is is it's taxpayers
 
00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:49.570 align:start position:0%
who overpaid their tax liability in the
 
00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:52.690 align:start position:0%
prior year so when a taxpayer either
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
pays their tax liability they can take
 
00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:56.860 align:start position:0%
it in two ways they can use a request a
 
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
refund or they can have that money over
 
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:23.050 align:start position:0%
it so it's not those taxes just recently
 
00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:24.790 align:start position:0%
to see how much of that is utilized
 
00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:27.310 align:start position:0%
everywhere it was a pretty consistent
 
00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:29.730 align:start position:0%
trend that about seventy five percent is
 
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:33.850 align:start position:0%
realized about six percent is refunded
 
00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:37.770 align:start position:0%
maybe about 19 percent as sort of a
 
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
potential liability and of course that
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
can fluctuate each year slightly with
 
00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:51.580 align:start position:0%
requests that's just one the need for
 
00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:56.770 align:start position:0%
extra cash during the carryover possibly
 
00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:00.130 align:start position:0%
no and the other is to defer the taxes
 
00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:03.310 align:start position:0%
into 2021 if they deferred far enough
 
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:04.090 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:08.770 align:start position:0%
why didn't they walk back into 2020 that
 
00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:12.030 align:start position:0%
would be it deferrals till September yes
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
yes paying substantial penalties
 
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:22.690 align:start position:0%
interest at that point but their goal is
 
00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:28.930 align:start position:0%
to stay alive yes so and you haven't
 
00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:31.060 align:start position:0%
been talking about the net operating
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
loss which we have more difficulty with
 
00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:43.450 align:start position:0%
still I believe with estimating how much
 
00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:52.780 align:start position:0%
is out there 2021 that would seem to me
 
00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:55.750 align:start position:0%
to be more likely to be used because
 
00:58:59.010 --> 00:58:59.020 align:start position:0%
there must be some reason that these
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
businesses are not using that that final
 
00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:08.410 align:start position:0%
19 percent each year unless they were
 
00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:10.570 align:start position:0%
really worried about a recession hurting
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
things now yeah because six percent goes
 
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:30.090 align:start position:0%
back in refunds no I'm just saying
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
that it's there businesses can save up
 
00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:45.130 align:start position:0%
to ten million dollars to be paying off
 
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:49.930 align:start position:0%
things you know we won't have good
 
00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:53.350 align:start position:0%
reasons for our numbers they won't write
 
00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:56.830 align:start position:0%
them right so in order to go forward I
 
01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:01.270 align:start position:0%
think on the time that I think we both
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
kind of agree towards the eye in our
 
01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:11.770 align:start position:0%
disagreement is on the Loewen yes and so
 
01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:17.730 align:start position:0%
now is the time to the ocean yes
 
01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:21.670 align:start position:0%
Tom Samberg has his hand up I don't know
 
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:23.530 align:start position:0%
if he is a question about what we're
 
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:29.250 align:start position:0%
talking about yes I do Madame chair
 
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:33.340 align:start position:0%
between what we've already heard and I
 
01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
think norm has just brought it up is
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
there a middle point that we can come to
 
01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:45.100 align:start position:0%
on the whole end here that's what he's
 
01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:52.900 align:start position:0%
talking about doing one of the reasons
 
01:00:59.180 --> 01:00:59.190 align:start position:0%
that we picked the low end as the the
 
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:02.890 align:start position:0%
agency's estimate is that it seemed to
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
us looking at the various
 
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:08.890 align:start position:0%
recommendations that they were being
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
really they are not used to giving us
 
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:15.010 align:start position:0%
single numbers they were used to giving
 
01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:19.030 align:start position:0%
us ranges but I presume they were asked
 
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:21.250 align:start position:0%
by the governor for single numbers and
 
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:24.970 align:start position:0%
then they passed them on to us on and it
 
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:27.430 align:start position:0%
seemed to us that they were being risk
 
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:29.830 align:start position:0%
averse in those single numbers and
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
taking their low end I don't know if
 
01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:34.150 align:start position:0%
they would be willing to talk about that
 
01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:42.190 align:start position:0%
or not if Melissa would be want to say
 
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
anything about how they picked a single
 
01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:46.810 align:start position:0%
number whether they were heading towards
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
the midpoint where they were heading
 
01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:51.790 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom so that they wouldn't
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
have to later say oh it's less than that
 
01:01:57.690 --> 01:01:57.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question represent
 
01:01:59.640 --> 01:01:59.650 align:start position:0%
Amy I think we just looked at a
 
01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
completely different this year than we
 
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:03.010 align:start position:0%
typically did I think Commissioner step
 
01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:05.530 align:start position:0%
had sort of alluded to this that there
 
01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:07.300 align:start position:0%
are so many different scenarios that we
 
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:09.700 align:start position:0%
could have picked and we just sort of
 
01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:12.730 align:start position:0%
tried to go and identify what we thought
 
01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:18.220 align:start position:0%
would happen based on the data that we
 
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.050 align:start position:0%
had already received and looking at each
 
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:22.510 align:start position:0%
individual painting type by fiscal year
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
and that's how we got to the number
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
on either side of that number of course
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
we've never done it before so while the
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
truth is the best day that we have to
 
01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:47.670 align:start position:0%
get to where we we got to thank you a
 
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
bottom number no I don't think we looked
 
01:02:53.609 --> 01:02:53.619 align:start position:0%
at this is this was a risk averse bottom
 
01:02:55.289 --> 01:02:55.299 align:start position:0%
number I think this is where we just
 
01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
looked at this is where we thought they
 
01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:10.329 align:start position:0%
would come in at yeah okay so let me try
 
01:03:18.809 --> 01:03:18.819 align:start position:0%
a compromise here which would be it's
 
01:03:21.539 --> 01:03:21.549 align:start position:0%
going to be quite a large range but I
 
01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:26.380 align:start position:0%
think we were that the situation
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
probably requires it
 
01:03:34.259 --> 01:03:34.269 align:start position:0%
can we rip salami you never have some
 
01:03:42.499 --> 01:03:42.509 align:start position:0%
Tucker who has her hand up country I'm
 
01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:45.099 align:start position:0%
you're apparently about to come up with
 
01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:49.349 align:start position:0%
the number but I was gonna suggest 650
 
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:52.660 align:start position:0%
you can say ting out I was going to
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
recommend 650 as the number six five Oh
 
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
recommend 650 as the number six five Oh
mm-hmm

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:00.450 align:start position:0%
mm-hmm
 
01:04:06.569 --> 01:04:06.579 align:start position:0%
as a compromise because lower number yes
 
01:04:10.979 --> 01:04:10.989 align:start position:0%
and concerns we were spending so much
 
01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:14.980 align:start position:0%
time on FY 20 when I think 21 is going
 
01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:22.900 align:start position:0%
to be much more did almost 21 is we were
 
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:27.190 align:start position:0%
very close on 21 actually and I don't
 
01:04:31.259 --> 01:04:31.269 align:start position:0%
know what the methodology is used on the
 
01:04:33.599 --> 01:04:33.609 align:start position:0%
other side where we've had to develop
 
01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:38.420 align:start position:0%
these and anyway that was my suggestions
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
yes so let's take 652 716 and see how
 
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:51.700 align:start position:0%
many people are willing to vote on that
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
represent major would you go along with
 
01:05:00.279 --> 01:05:00.289 align:start position:0%
that just as a first effort or do you
 
01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:04.700 align:start position:0%
want to try let's try one thing at a
 
01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:10.630 align:start position:0%
time one thing at a time to try 650 to
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
716 sure alternative let's call it one
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
just in case although in 2020 a low of
 
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:45.470 align:start position:0%
yes I'm making a note on my sheet here
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
of that particular one because we're
 
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:50.450 align:start position:0%
gonna take I'll fill out a separate vote
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
sheet for each one of these proposals so
 
01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:00.580 align:start position:0%
we'll have it documented yeah so for
 
01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:05.090 align:start position:0%
alternative one that we've just talked
 
01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:16.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:22.570 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:30.740 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth yes clerk
 
01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:35.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:42.370 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:48.230 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker yes person
 
01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:49.150 align:start position:0%
tentative bunker
 
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:01.930 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:13.450 align:start position:0%
representative major yes represented
 
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:25.810 align:start position:0%
Griffin yeah represent Valerie represent
 
01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:27.310 align:start position:0%
all right yeah there we go
 
01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:36.090 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:48.690 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:50.980 align:start position:0%
think we've lost Rick represent
 
01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:58.330 align:start position:0%
interesting yes you have representative
 
01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:08.070 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.020 --> 01:08:13.030 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards yes I'm sending
 
01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:22.710 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you it looks like we can go with
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
that one the vote being 13 to 4 on will
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
go with 650 to 716 for the first year
 
01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:10.190 align:start position:0%
the second year we have two ranges one I
 
01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
am proposing from 582 656 and the other
 
01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:20.210 align:start position:0%
on representing major is proposing from
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
574 to 653 observe almac did you give me
 
01:09:47.729 --> 01:09:47.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:53.020 align:start position:0%
thank you I represent Brahmi has his
 
01:09:59.180 --> 01:09:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:06.430 align:start position:0%
represent of a bra me your dude okay
 
01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:10.570 align:start position:0%
how's that I very close on these I would
 
01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:12.250 align:start position:0%
just say take the average of the high
 
01:10:15.330 --> 01:10:15.340 align:start position:0%
and the low and call it a day this is a
 
01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:19.030 align:start position:0%
very fun to project yes just quickly we
 
01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:23.710 align:start position:0%
think things are going to come back with
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
this clothes on high and a low
 
01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:28.870 align:start position:0%
so again my suggestion is take the
 
01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:33.820 align:start position:0%
midpoint of both yes we essentially took
 
01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:36.310 align:start position:0%
a little bit larger range than you did
 
01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:40.590 align:start position:0%
but I think we each respected the
 
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:45.810 align:start position:0%
agency's attempt to estimate this as a
 
01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative Eames has his hand up
 
01:11:27.129 --> 01:11:27.139 align:start position:0%
ripp surnames have San Mames he may need
 
01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:30.170 align:start position:0%
to respond to a prompt about muting yes
 
01:11:34.319 --> 01:11:34.329 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so yeah I just wanted to
 
01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
support representative romney's
 
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:40.010 align:start position:0%
suggestion i think that's a reasonable
 
01:11:48.989 --> 01:11:48.999 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
there we go yeah I think we're gonna be
 
01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:58.010 align:start position:0%
pleasantly surprised in 21 a lot of
 
01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:01.039 align:start position:0%
people have put if you take a look at
 
01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:03.380 align:start position:0%
the savings accounts in their other
 
01:12:05.739 --> 01:12:05.749 align:start position:0%
rates a lot of that stimulus money went
 
01:12:08.859 --> 01:12:08.869 align:start position:0%
into savings so I think there we're
 
01:12:10.419 --> 01:12:10.429 align:start position:0%
going to be pleasantly surprised but
 
01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:12.460 align:start position:0%
I'll stick with what we have right there
 
01:12:20.739 --> 01:12:20.749 align:start position:0%
okay I thought the stimulus money was
 
01:12:25.419 --> 01:12:25.429 align:start position:0%
required to be spent actually they
 
01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:27.260 align:start position:0%
didn't call it stimulus today they
 
01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:42.050 align:start position:0%
called it survival represents to unmute
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
please Jerry all right the the the way
 
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:51.670 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the stimulus money works
 
01:12:54.339 --> 01:12:54.349 align:start position:0%
especially for state tax it just things
 
01:12:59.169 --> 01:12:59.179 align:start position:0%
like the PPE the for federal for federal
 
01:13:04.479 --> 01:13:04.489 align:start position:0%
taxes the PPP money they receive is not
 
01:13:08.529 --> 01:13:08.539 align:start position:0%
taxable but the expenditures that turn
 
01:13:11.259 --> 01:13:11.269 align:start position:0%
it into a grant on largely on payroll
 
01:13:15.089 --> 01:13:15.099 align:start position:0%
are still deductible from the income
 
01:13:17.649 --> 01:13:17.659 align:start position:0%
however you know our best understanding
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
and without a change in the law is that
 
01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
the the PP money they receive
 
01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
we'll be taxable for state business
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
taxes even though it's not taxable or
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
federal income tax for the businesses so
 
01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:38.700 align:start position:0%
they vote and and businesses that are
 
01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:41.370 align:start position:0%
doing well like law firms that got some
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
PPP money or or certain other businesses
 
01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:47.670 align:start position:0%
may have not seen much of a decline
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
I've actually still received PPP money
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
still had pretty much the same amount of
 
01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
income in a similar amount of expenses
 
01:13:58.730 --> 01:13:58.740 align:start position:0%
so they're actually gonna see a little
 
01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:03.390 align:start position:0%
bit of a boost in their business income
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
or business profits tax purposes and
 
01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
that'll be part of this second year of
 
01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
the biennium calculation I mean it's not
 
01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:16.110 align:start position:0%
true for everyone and there's obviously
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of businesses you know that are
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
severely bottom line hurt but a lot of
 
01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
the stimulus money is not you know
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
purely offsetting new costs or lost
 
01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
profits for the businesses and it may
 
01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:38.490 align:start position:0%
actually fill in some some some of you
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
know overall the gap in in in lost
 
01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
profit that we saw I mean I know I
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
couldn't give you a range but because
 
01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
the way our business taxes are set up
 
01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
you know that may buffer a little bit of
 
01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:57.950 align:start position:0%
or a significant portion of the hit that
 
01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:02.700 align:start position:0%
that we would have seen this year so so
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the stip whether the
 
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:08.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:10.950 align:start position:0%
following up on representative ovaries
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
comments I would have to say I agree I
 
01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:16.460 align:start position:0%
agree with that sentiment you know maybe
 
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
you know using a slightly different
 
01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:25.790 align:start position:0%
you know using a slightly different
rationale

01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.210 --> 01:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
thank you we're talking about a hit of
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
about 70 million at the high end year to
 
01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:53.490 align:start position:0%
year and the low end at this point and
 
01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:57.710 align:start position:0%
70 million also I well a little bit
 
01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:08.250 align:start position:0%
from year to year based on what happens
 
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
in 20 that we tax in 21 so does anyone
 
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
want to change the 577 to 655 for the
 
01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:27.570 align:start position:0%
second year
 
01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:31.950 align:start position:0%
on this basis or just represent a
 
01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
represent how does he end up just went
 
01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:36.500 align:start position:0%
represent how does he end up just went
dead

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:36.510 align:start position:0%
dead
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay again represent bursting yeah I
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted Jordan's comments - I didn't
 
01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:48.330 align:start position:0%
interpret it as the business sector was
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
saving I think an article came across my
 
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
newsfeed this week that the April
 
01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
savings rate among consumers among the
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer was 33 percent and that was a
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
record savings rate for any and I
 
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
interpreted Jordan's comment
 
01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:08.550 align:start position:0%
representative all these comments to be
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
focusing on the consumer or the taxpayer
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
not he wasn't talking about the business
 
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:16.290 align:start position:0%
stimulus I think he was talking about
 
01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
the 12 on your dollar check I don't know
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
if I agree with his point but I think
 
01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
that was his point and maybe he could
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
get back on here to clarify that's it
 
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:28.590 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you represent all or do you
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
No and then rep says his you do oh yes
 
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
we do not fear us he ranked zebra but
 
01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:47.790 align:start position:0%
now do you know yes absolutely
 
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:53.850 align:start position:0%
this is a pain yes um Allen was correct
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
I was referring to the $1200 savings in
 
01:17:59.960 --> 01:17:59.970 align:start position:0%
the 33% rate and then once people are
 
01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:01.770 align:start position:0%
allowed to get out and get around and
 
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
you start doing things I think will see
 
01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:06.830 align:start position:0%
a boost in meals rooms and the business
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
taxes as well as the entire economy in
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
the entire society actually starts
 
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:16.050 align:start position:0%
getting active and starts going again in
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
and will come back with a bigger boom
 
01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:24.510 align:start position:0%
than it has but again you know 70
 
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
million I don't know if we're gonna take
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
that big of a hit or not for the second
 
01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:41.090 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:48.090 align:start position:0%
Tucker onion please yes I think we
 
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
should try a vote on the alternative one
 
01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:57.510 align:start position:0%
I think at that point we're presented
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
this quite reasonable okay any other
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
comments then the clerk will call the
 
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:17.250 align:start position:0%
roll on business taxes FY 21 low of 577
 
01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:35.390 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:39.380 align:start position:0%
okay there we go
 
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
this is for the vote on the vote of the
 
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:51.810 align:start position:0%
low of 577 million to the high of 655
 
01:19:58.570 --> 01:19:58.580 align:start position:0%
million for FY 2021 representative aims
 
01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:06.180 align:start position:0%
yes obscenity of Carrick yes presented
 
01:20:09.130 --> 01:20:09.140 align:start position:0%

bunker yes

representative gamar low speak up please
 
01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:41.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:48.500 align:start position:0%
tentative major yes percent of Griffin
 
01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:55.070 align:start position:0%
yeah representative O'Leary yes there's
 
01:20:58.140 --> 01:20:58.150 align:start position:0%
the end of a bra me yes
 
01:21:12.490 --> 01:21:12.500 align:start position:0%
representative Lang yes representative
 
01:21:19.979 --> 01:21:19.989 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:22.790 align:start position:0%
representative all me yes
 
01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:36.430 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.959 --> 01:21:37.969 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:44.459 --> 01:21:44.469 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:48.830 align:start position:0%
recommendation of 577 million for a low
 
01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:52.070 align:start position:0%
number and six six six 55 for a high
 
01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:55.370 align:start position:0%
number for business taxes in FY 21
 
01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:07.730 align:start position:0%
passes and will get entered okay we also
 
01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:14.780 align:start position:0%
have a considerable range for the meals
 
01:22:19.959 --> 01:22:19.969 align:start position:0%
and rooms taxes on in the second year in
 
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:26.770 align:start position:0%
the first year what we are looking at on
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
on I am proposing a range of 321 to 323
 
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:41.890 align:start position:0%
this tax is mostly in at this point and
 
01:22:48.669 --> 01:22:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:52.610 align:start position:0%
we have the prep send major on right now
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
yes for the 2020 we're going to stick
 
01:23:01.959 --> 01:23:01.969 align:start position:0%
with the agency's number three 18.6 26
 
01:23:06.620 --> 01:23:06.630 align:start position:0%
then for the second year we have a law
 
01:23:11.689 --> 01:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
of 320 point two got into that one yet
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay all right so so the I'm trying to
 
01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:29.850 align:start position:0%
remember here the agency estimate I
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
believe is three 18.6 and they revised
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
part way through our process they
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
revised it I think was just at the just
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
before the weekend they revised it to
 
01:23:56.479 --> 01:23:56.489 align:start position:0%
318 six yes and before that they were at
 
01:24:04.129 --> 01:24:04.139 align:start position:0%
321 to 323 rather they were at 320 2.3
 
01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:12.570 align:start position:0%
or something like that I forget so could
 
01:24:15.459 --> 01:24:15.469 align:start position:0%
perhaps we listen to
 
01:24:19.490 --> 01:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rawlins talk to us about why
 
01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:26.730 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:30.580 align:start position:0%
representative Ali their vision was just
 
01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:36.130 align:start position:0%
to to an adjustment to the formula I'm
 
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:39.070 align:start position:0%
looking at a presentation we have done
 
01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:41.830 align:start position:0%
an adjustment to the months based on the
 
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:47.050 align:start position:0%
code of 19 as well as an economic
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.170 --> 01:24:55.180 align:start position:0%
yeah the economic adjustment that's what
 
01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:57.310 align:start position:0%
the reduction in the 3 million was was
 
01:24:59.780 --> 01:24:59.790 align:start position:0%
reducing the economic adjustment which
 
01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:02.770 align:start position:0%
was how plan was coming in without an
 
01:25:25.770 --> 01:25:25.780 align:start position:0%
effect of code 19 we need in June what
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
we expect to get in June you're taking
 
01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:31.630 align:start position:0%
the entire economic adjustment as I
 
01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:33.670 align:start position:0%
understand it off the month of June and
 
01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:37.270 align:start position:0%
I understand why that makes sense in
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
terms of chewing up on the the business
 
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:48.010 align:start position:0%
taxes because they're putting in two
 
01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:51.430 align:start position:0%
estimates at the same time in and doing
 
01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of them and they're chewing up
 
01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:57.250 align:start position:0%
what they did the prior year in their
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
reporting but taking it off of June when
 
01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:05.350 align:start position:0%
we've already got all the rest of the
 
01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:12.790 align:start position:0%
money in the bank seems seems a strange
 
01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:19.130 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:23.670 align:start position:0%
it's it's a 0.8% adjustment for the
 
01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:25.230 align:start position:0%
economic adjustment of the fiscal year
 
01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:31.670 align:start position:0%
twenty so the revenue had floating
 
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
thought there might be an adjustment
 
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
that might come down a little bit more
 
01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:38.390 align:start position:0%
compared to how plan was so I think
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioner step had spoke about how we
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
originally did the plan as if there was
 
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:49.530 align:start position:0%
no covin 19 happening so we made any
 
01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:51.270 align:start position:0%
adjustments that we thought would just
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
typically happen if we were doing the
 
01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:56.790 align:start position:0%
estimate adjustment presentation to you
 
01:26:58.580 --> 01:26:58.590 align:start position:0%
guys at this point and that would have
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
been a 0.8% which is the 3 million down
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
for June and then we looked at what the
 
01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:10.170 align:start position:0%
adjustment would have been for June
 
01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
which I think we had a 56% adjustment
 
01:27:20.210 --> 01:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
which was about the 17 million which was
 
01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:31.340 align:start position:0%
a reduction of three had anticipated
 
01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:33.630 align:start position:0%
so again I think you have some wiggle
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
room you know as the 321 to the 318 and
 
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
I think we will be comfortable with a
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
number somewhere in there between 318
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
and 321 yep ok 73083 million dollars
 
01:27:52.190 --> 01:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
that we were we were talking about yes
 
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:56.730 align:start position:0%
but it seems to me you're taking the
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
entire economic adjustment for the year
 
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:01.590 align:start position:0%
that we've already experienced 11 months
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the year and putting it into the
 
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:09.450 align:start position:0%
final month and and these taxes are
 
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:12.390 align:start position:0%
collected monthly on the basis of
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
reality rather than in terms of
 
01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:18.209 align:start position:0%
reality rather than in terms of
estimates

01:28:18.209 --> 01:28:18.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:21.530 align:start position:0%
that I I still think for June we would
 
01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:23.210 align:start position:0%
have thought without code of nineteen
 
01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:28.930 align:start position:0%
that we would have fallen below plan yes
 
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
by 0.8 percent in June not what
 
01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:40.100 align:start position:0%
disregarding the kovat 19 but the Cohen
 
01:28:44.170 --> 01:28:44.180 align:start position:0%
19 is already shown up in May which was
 
01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:48.130 align:start position:0%
the April numbers which were full coding
 
01:28:51.459 --> 01:28:51.469 align:start position:0%
so I didn't think I'm sorry I misspoke
 
01:28:54.459 --> 01:28:54.469 align:start position:0%
but the 3 million was spread out when we
 
01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:57.890 align:start position:0%
get our revenue estimates for May June
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
and they came in you can feel free to
 
01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:02.930 align:start position:0%
adjust that if you don't think that's
 
01:29:02.930 --> 01:29:03.990 align:start position:0%
adjust that if you don't think that's
correct

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:13.850 align:start position:0%
we're fine with that yeah well how many
 
01:29:18.729 --> 01:29:18.739 align:start position:0%
people are willing to go with you said
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
318 but you'd said before or 3 18.6
 
01:29:28.750 --> 01:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
which rounds up to 319 but we could
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
leave it at 3 18.6 are willing to go
 
01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:38.870 align:start position:0%
with that as the low number and 321 is
 
01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:42.050 align:start position:0%
the high number of ami reps fo Brahmi
 
01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
has his hand up on represented but
 
01:29:48.490 --> 01:29:48.500 align:start position:0%
Brahmi as well as major reps and agents
 
01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:55.610 align:start position:0%
yes I see no point to mid point even
 
01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:58.250 align:start position:0%
though we don't have a range at 1.4 man
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
apart which is a percent yeah at some
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
320 oh there was a major way in nature
 
01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:13.730 align:start position:0%
webs on earth Romney correct why don't
 
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
we just what the difference it's not
 
01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
would be less than a percent now yes can
 
01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:27.410 align:start position:0%
we can we do it arranged then would you
 
01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:30.570 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
for this the first answer for the
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
differences of tool and I would propose
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
we go to 3:21 period without a range
 
01:31:10.190 --> 01:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
right no worries okay any comments on
 
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
right no worries okay any comments on
that

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:12.330 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:18.010 align:start position:0%
I've got no hands up so we are talking
 
01:31:20.700 --> 01:31:20.710 align:start position:0%
about fairly small differences at this
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
point so so we have that as a
 
01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:34.330 align:start position:0%
possibility for twenty and twenty-one we
 
01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:37.750 align:start position:0%
have a much wider difference why don't
 
01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:42.850 align:start position:0%
we blow it on twenty okay so if there
 
01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:45.670 align:start position:0%
are is no further discussion on twenty
 
01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:47.970 align:start position:0%
and the clerk will call the roll on
 
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
Nelson Rose fiscal year twenty at 321
 
01:31:54.060 --> 01:32:06.940 align:start position:0%
Nelson Rose fiscal year twenty at 321
million

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.230 --> 01:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:14.390 align:start position:0%
this is for the rooms and meals tax
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
estimate for 2020 at 321 represented
 
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
aims yes
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
representing Carrick yes
 
01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
I'm Senate of Southworth I need to be
 
01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:43.190 align:start position:0%
unmuted okay yes
 
01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:49.050 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes percentage Hamburg
 
01:32:55.940 --> 01:32:55.950 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sanity of Tucker yes substantive
 
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yes presented
 
01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:21.230 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:25.770 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin yeah was that of
 
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
all are--
 
01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:38.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:44.510 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet yes because they
 
01:33:48.090 --> 01:33:48.100 align:start position:0%
have had words yes
 
01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:54.350 align:start position:0%
representative Burstein yes cuz then
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
Evol me yes
 
01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:11.390 align:start position:0%
oh is 17 yes 0 no and 1 not voting thank
 
01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:17.890 align:start position:0%
you the vote for is in rooms FY 20 and
 
01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:26.590 align:start position:0%
321 million passes we will proceed to 21
 
01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:34.430 align:start position:0%
now the Democrats on this took the
 
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
agency number and went down considerably
 
01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:41.990 align:start position:0%
the Republican caucus took the agency
 
01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:45.410 align:start position:0%
number and went up considerably so you
 
01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
really do need to discuss this
 
01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:57.610 align:start position:0%
I'm putting as a start on low of tuna
 
01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:04.330 align:start position:0%
259 million to a high of 323 million
 
01:35:12.370 --> 01:35:12.380 align:start position:0%
represent a major law of 320 point to a
 
01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:22.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
so would you like to start or someone on
 
01:35:32.919 --> 01:35:32.929 align:start position:0%
may that you indicate on the Republican
 
01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:46.570 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.330 --> 01:35:49.340 align:start position:0%
metric seems to have disappeared for a
 
01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:00.730 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.959 --> 01:36:06.969 align:start position:0%
well I oh here comes Patrick Romney on
 
01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:10.850 align:start position:0%
you you got muted again immediately but
 
01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:14.290 align:start position:0%
we'd like you to explain how the
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
Republicans decided to go up from the
 
01:36:23.649 --> 01:36:23.659 align:start position:0%
the agency estimate on twenty three
 
01:36:27.490 --> 01:36:27.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the second year for
 
01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:46.310 align:start position:0%
Nielsen ropes thank you again and I
 
01:36:53.970 --> 01:36:53.980 align:start position:0%
guess in our discussion that the hotel
 
01:36:58.570 --> 01:36:58.580 align:start position:0%
although with restrictions sure how
 
01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:00.170 align:start position:0%
those restrictions for our status gets
 
01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:05.150 align:start position:0%
enforced but the hotels can open up and
 
01:37:10.209 --> 01:37:10.219 align:start position:0%
have probably some natural certain
 
01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:13.790 align:start position:0%
people it's gonna take a while for that
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
to work through in terms of people
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
having confidence to to partake but
 
01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:20.270 align:start position:0%
shots are open partially now I mean with
 
01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
the outdoors and we have a
 
01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:25.900 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
01:37:32.130 --> 01:37:32.140 align:start position:0%
who who was on me we open committee was
 
01:37:36.959 --> 01:37:36.969 align:start position:0%
very vocal about thinking that we we see
 
01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:39.250 align:start position:0%
the restaurants going indoor sooner than
 
01:37:44.189 --> 01:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
we think maybe a 50% initially but you
 
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
know so so we factor all that in up to
 
01:37:49.410 --> 01:37:49.420 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the this revenue was from
 
01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:52.630 align:start position:0%
restaurants and I guess that's why we
 
01:37:54.450 --> 01:37:54.460 align:start position:0%
had tomorrow optimistic view that that
 
01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:57.130 align:start position:0%
could have may go up a little quicker
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
than perhaps your caucus felt it would
 
01:38:06.630 --> 01:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much it thank you and in
 
01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:10.030 align:start position:0%
our caucus we were looking at all of the
 
01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:13.330 align:start position:0%
restaurants and lodging places that
 
01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:15.550 align:start position:0%
we've heard of that are have closed and
 
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:19.060 align:start position:0%
aren't opening again and thinking that
 
01:38:22.439 --> 01:38:22.449 align:start position:0%
it's going to be difficult to once that
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
is actually happened to replace them and
 
01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:30.100 align:start position:0%
it's going to take take at least a year
 
01:38:34.770 --> 01:38:34.780 align:start position:0%
if we're lucky before we get back to as
 
01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:40.030 align:start position:0%
many restaurants and and rooms as we had
 
01:38:44.729 --> 01:38:44.739 align:start position:0%
before so that's why we went down a lot
 
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:47.890 align:start position:0%
I cannot remember how we decided on that
 
01:38:51.439 --> 01:38:51.449 align:start position:0%
particular number at this point if
 
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:53.770 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm Tucker would you like to
 
01:38:53.770 --> 01:39:00.259 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm Tucker would you like to
speak

01:39:00.259 --> 01:39:00.269 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:04.590 align:start position:0%
yeah I've certainly been in touch with a
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
number of people around it and people
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
are just not going to keep their summer
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
plans the Lancaster fair isn't going to
 
01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:18.260 align:start position:0%
read open all kinds of activities
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
Jericho State Park all of these things
 
01:39:25.339 --> 01:39:25.349 align:start position:0%
which are ordinarily draw people from
 
01:39:27.979 --> 01:39:27.989 align:start position:0%
out of state and down state up here
 
01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
anyway are canceled and I think it's
 
01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:34.530 align:start position:0%
going to be a long time before people
 
01:39:36.979 --> 01:39:36.989 align:start position:0%
see that they can stay in a hotel eat
 
01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:39.900 align:start position:0%
out after all rooms and meals is mostly
 
01:39:43.009 --> 01:39:43.019 align:start position:0%
meals so drawing people into the state
 
01:39:47.299 --> 01:39:47.309 align:start position:0%
to eat out is a huge factor furthermore
 
01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:51.929 align:start position:0%
I see that people are going to be
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
cautious about spending their money I
 
01:39:57.919 --> 01:39:57.929 align:start position:0%
can't remember which one of our my
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues talked about the number of
 
01:40:04.549 --> 01:40:04.559 align:start position:0%
people who had saved their checks that
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
came for stimulus and I think that
 
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:08.509 align:start position:0%
came for stimulus and I think that
cautiousness

01:40:08.509 --> 01:40:08.519 align:start position:0%
cautiousness
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
is a natural reaction probably a good
 
01:40:16.879 --> 01:40:16.889 align:start position:0%
reaction to adversity so I I think being
 
01:40:21.069 --> 01:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
over optimistic is not a good idea I
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
jump in Susan yes bro me and then okay
 
01:40:33.259 --> 01:40:33.269 align:start position:0%
our new point is 54 million below no
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
plan dude the plan that we did during
 
01:40:38.239 --> 01:40:38.249 align:start position:0%
the budget cycle so we were getting to
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
know some returns on them but we also
 
01:40:44.299 --> 01:40:44.309 align:start position:0%
know that and I think we're starting to
 
01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
recognize this I can't speak for the
 
01:40:49.399 --> 01:40:49.409 align:start position:0%
government obviously but my assumption
 
01:40:53.049 --> 01:40:53.059 align:start position:0%
he sees aware that the longer we wait to
 
01:40:55.879 --> 01:40:55.889 align:start position:0%
die which means the more likely more of
 
01:40:57.259 --> 01:40:57.269 align:start position:0%
them going to go are going to go out of
 
01:41:02.359 --> 01:41:02.369 align:start position:0%
business so I just saw that out what
 
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:09.310 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:11.030 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:14.750 align:start position:0%
the I kind of agree with the comments I
 
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:16.100 align:start position:0%
was just gonna throw in the Highland
 
01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:18.770 align:start position:0%
Games which is the biggest weekend here
 
01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:22.970 align:start position:0%
in Lincoln in Woodstock area the entire
 
01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:25.430 align:start position:0%
year it's that's in late September
 
01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:26.990 align:start position:0%
it's the biggest Scottish games in the
 
01:41:31.890 --> 01:41:31.900 align:start position:0%
country is postponed for this year so
 
01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:33.890 align:start position:0%
they've canceled it for this year I
 
01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:35.290 align:start position:0%
should say so
 
01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:38.050 align:start position:0%
you know I do see some fairly
 
01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:43.130 align:start position:0%
significant draws to the area being
 
01:41:46.450 --> 01:41:46.460 align:start position:0%
reduced so you know the midpoint should
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
at least be fifty million below what our
 
01:41:57.780 --> 01:41:57.790 align:start position:0%
estimate was before I would say we also
 
01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:04.630 align:start position:0%
in places like Manchester are possibly
 
01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:08.590 align:start position:0%
certainly this summer Lebanon and
 
01:42:13.690 --> 01:42:13.700 align:start position:0%
Hanover area we've got on a lot of
 
01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:18.230 align:start position:0%
businesses are getting very used to zoom
 
01:42:20.710 --> 01:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
meetings instead of sending people
 
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:23.690 align:start position:0%
across the country very few people for
 
01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:26.830 align:start position:0%
quite a while they're going to be
 
01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
wanting to get on the plane and the
 
01:42:32.670 --> 01:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
airlines industries are are pretty
 
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:34.970 align:start position:0%
desperate about that right now
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
and and that means that the business
 
01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:44.690 align:start position:0%
travel is is going to be down as in
 
01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:47.450 align:start position:0%
places that don't normally see real
 
01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:51.260 align:start position:0%
tourists I don't consider going to tour
 
01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:53.390 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College as being tourism but
 
01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:01.070 align:start position:0%
some people do and and that's another
 
01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:04.820 align:start position:0%
factor that isn't isn't just the areas
 
01:43:08.050 --> 01:43:08.060 align:start position:0%
that depend on these major events that
 
01:43:11.050 --> 01:43:11.060 align:start position:0%
the rest of us really value and try to
 
01:43:15.850 --> 01:43:15.860 align:start position:0%
go to so on we've got three hands up now
 
01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:18.830 align:start position:0%
represent in Ames and then represent
 
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:20.090 align:start position:0%
Burstein and then
 
01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:27.430 align:start position:0%
Raavi represent of aims okay I think
 
01:43:31.690 --> 01:43:31.700 align:start position:0%
another reason for the low estimate from
 
01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:36.220 align:start position:0%
the Democrats hasn't been mentioned
 
01:43:41.890 --> 01:43:41.900 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe I missed it but the it
 
01:43:45.370 --> 01:43:45.380 align:start position:0%
relates to the possibility some would
 
01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
say probability out there wrong that the
 
01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:52.190 align:start position:0%
there will be a resurgence of the virus
 
01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:00.410 align:start position:0%
and if that occurs then the gradual
 
01:44:07.690 --> 01:44:07.700 align:start position:0%
opening of the sources of the meals and
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
rum stacks that I think it's certainly a
 
01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:20.570 align:start position:0%
premise of the DAR dra estimate will be
 
01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:25.130 align:start position:0%
reversed sort of inevitably maybe we're
 
01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:28.910 align:start position:0%
better at managing an epidemic now but I
 
01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:33.380 align:start position:0%
think there will be a reversal and it's
 
01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:38.270 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a question of optimism or
 
01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
pessimism in my judgment it's a question
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
of looking at the possibility of a
 
01:44:55.420 --> 01:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
reversal here and and anticipating that
 
01:44:58.720 --> 01:44:58.730 align:start position:0%
you know low estimate that's part of a
 
01:45:02.890 --> 01:45:02.900 align:start position:0%
low high set of estimates and in terms
 
01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:08.210 align:start position:0%
of dealing with our state budget I think
 
01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:12.710 align:start position:0%
it's it's important that that the
 
01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:17.350 align:start position:0%
decision-makers factored into their
 
01:45:19.570 --> 01:45:19.580 align:start position:0%
decision making the possibility that
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
revenues will be significantly down
 
01:45:28.570 --> 01:45:28.580 align:start position:0%
because of the virus resurgence that
 
01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:31.850 align:start position:0%
could have happened so that's my comment
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you they seem to be pretty sure
 
01:45:37.670 --> 01:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
that we'll have at least some resurgence
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
when the fluid flu epidemic starts just
 
01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:45.510 align:start position:0%
not encouraging but on represent
 
01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:51.690 align:start position:0%
bursting Thank You Jeremy really
 
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:55.170 align:start position:0%
interesting discussion and a lot of you
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
bring up some really valid points well I
 
01:46:01.670 --> 01:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
am let's call it marginally optimistic
 
01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:03.810 align:start position:0%
about next year
 
01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:06.270 align:start position:0%
I think the prudent thing to do is to
 
01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:08.250 align:start position:0%
err on the side of caution and if
 
01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
there's a proposal to to drop the low
 
01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:15.510 align:start position:0%
range I'm willing to deviate
 
01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:17.850 align:start position:0%
significantly from the Republican low
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
range that's all I have to say thank you
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
rip said it but Brahmi wants to talk
 
01:46:27.239 --> 01:46:45.700 align:start position:0%
rip said it but Brahmi wants to talk
again

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:45.710 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
I'm asking representative about me to
 
01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:56.330 align:start position:0%
Thank You chair be careful this could
 
01:46:59.830 --> 01:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
put up our about your Susan your
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
estimate your the Democratic caucus in
 
01:47:04.530 --> 01:47:04.540 align:start position:0%
the Republican caucus highs and lows oh
 
01:47:09.870 --> 01:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
yeah he hasn't put them up se and this
 
01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:17.810 align:start position:0%
could could you put up the the LME highs
 
01:47:24.729 --> 01:47:24.739 align:start position:0%
and lows you're not seeing that right
 
01:47:26.939 --> 01:47:26.949 align:start position:0%
now no we aren't
 
01:47:48.630 --> 01:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
hold on a second you know yes thank you
 
01:47:53.410 --> 01:47:53.420 align:start position:0%
so again the midpoint to midpoint of the
 
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:57.070 align:start position:0%
ranges were we're 42 way in and change
 
01:48:07.330 --> 01:48:07.340 align:start position:0%
defense on the range and that's
 
01:48:09.939 --> 01:48:09.949 align:start position:0%
something we should discuss but alone
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
speak and then and then we can stop
 
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
number I guess okay on rape centered
 
01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:20.270 align:start position:0%
nature probably should have been in this
 
01:48:23.229 --> 01:48:23.239 align:start position:0%
from the start and he's back now I'd
 
01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:24.850 align:start position:0%
like to take him next
 
01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:29.860 align:start position:0%
and they'd member said Edwards this tack
 
01:48:33.399 --> 01:48:33.409 align:start position:0%
rooms and males tax is one of the most
 
01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:35.870 align:start position:0%
volatile that we have to deal with and
 
01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:39.110 align:start position:0%
it's an immediate tax whereas the
 
01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:42.650 align:start position:0%
interest whereas the business tax is a
 
01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:50.330 align:start position:0%
delayed tax yes the sense is extremely
 
01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:57.230 align:start position:0%
volatile its its volatile to if we have
 
01:48:59.950 --> 01:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
a resurgent is volatile
 
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:04.210 align:start position:0%
if we have a vaccine none of us know
 
01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:07.250 align:start position:0%
these things are gonna happen my feeling
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
is is probably is and so no matter who
 
01:49:17.670 --> 01:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
we are we're not gonna get it right I
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any problem of raising our
 
01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:28.910 align:start position:0%
estimates because they're just as well
 
01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:33.370 align:start position:0%
there as what we have now if I look at
 
01:49:43.210 --> 01:49:43.220 align:start position:0%
all estimates we get saved your lowers
 
01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:46.550 align:start position:0%
our high essentially right how low was
 
01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:50.030 align:start position:0%
320 and your low was 259 that's a that's
 
01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:54.550 align:start position:0%
a 61 million dollar spread right problem
 
01:49:58.230 --> 01:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
raising hours by 31 million dollars
 
01:50:04.150 --> 01:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
raising it yeah your lowest iment I'm
 
01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:08.010 align:start position:0%
raising it yeah your lowest iment I'm
sorry

01:50:08.010 --> 01:50:08.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.410 --> 01:50:14.420 align:start position:0%
going the other way so lowering at 31
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars you said which would
 
01:50:33.370 --> 01:50:33.380 align:start position:0%
bring us to - 89 - 89 89 - 89 and on the
 
01:50:36.090 --> 01:50:36.100 align:start position:0%
other end we're not that's why our part
 
01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:41.090 align:start position:0%
and we were 23 million a placing in a
 
01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:45.650 align:start position:0%
point and no problem
 
01:50:48.610 --> 01:50:48.620 align:start position:0%
changing 12 because of the volatility
 
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
and then the possibility of a vaccine
 
01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:57.290 align:start position:0%
not only one resurgence but our number
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
of researchers so so I would raise or
 
01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:12.450 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:24.310 align:start position:0%
3:34 yes yes in practical terms there
 
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be any way that we could
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
have a vaccine out to the public until
 
01:51:37.230 --> 01:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
at least the fourth quarter Oh next year
 
01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:41.770 align:start position:0%
I tend to agree with that but there's
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
everybody and various countries they're
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
racing to do it but I kind of agree what
 
01:51:53.640 --> 01:51:53.650 align:start position:0%
you're saying yeah well scientifically
 
01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:56.710 align:start position:0%
you can't do the tests you need in less
 
01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:03.250 align:start position:0%
time and they're doing them now and if
 
01:52:05.610 --> 01:52:05.620 align:start position:0%
people don't see safety apparently half
 
01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:09.510 align:start position:0%
the population won't even get vaccinated
 
01:52:14.970 --> 01:52:14.980 align:start position:0%
which isn't enough to reduce the fear
 
01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:22.450 align:start position:0%
factors and the epidemics well that's
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
what I throw out to 89 334 well would
 
01:52:34.110 --> 01:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
someone from on I see that
 
01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:36.130 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards took his hand
 
01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:48.950 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I want to say that I think
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
that moving as represented major I
 
01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:58.530 align:start position:0%
suggested this is a very reasonable way
 
01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:03.390 align:start position:0%
to first all to go the there's just
 
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
tremendous uncertainty out there and
 
01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:08.270 align:start position:0%
it's impossible
 
01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:12.110 align:start position:0%
truly it's it's truly impossible to know
 
01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:15.150 align:start position:0%
which direction this is going to go and
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
we all hope that it will move you know
 
01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
move to and a resurgence of the economy
 
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:29.460 align:start position:0%
rather than the virus but but that's a
 
01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:33.750 align:start position:0%
hope so I think moving the way suggested
 
01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:37.230 align:start position:0%
keeps keeps a pretty broad range which
 
01:53:41.870 --> 01:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
reflects the uncertainties and it's also
 
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
a range that starts in its high point at
 
01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:49.370 align:start position:0%
a lower level than we've been at
 
01:53:52.970 --> 01:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
traditionally because of what all that's
 
01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:56.190 align:start position:0%
happened and and so it's all great very
 
01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.890 --> 01:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
any further discussion of this I don't
 
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:17.910 align:start position:0%
see any hands so we'll have the clerk
 
01:54:25.630 --> 01:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
call the roll on this alternative for
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
males and rooms FY 21 arranged from a
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.899 --> 01:54:45.909 align:start position:0%
okay this is rooms and meals tax
 
01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:53.570 align:start position:0%
estimate 20 21 289 to 334 representative
 
01:54:53.570 --> 01:54:53.979 align:start position:0%
estimate 20 21 289 to 334 representative
Eames

01:54:53.979 --> 01:54:53.989 align:start position:0%
Eames
 
01:55:04.140 --> 01:55:04.150 align:start position:0%
yes thank Eric yes
 
01:55:12.090 --> 01:55:12.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:16.270 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
01:55:20.910 --> 01:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes represent a Schamberg
 
01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:23.910 align:start position:0%
clerk votes yes represent a Schamberg
yes

01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:55:25.450 --> 01:55:25.460 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker
 
01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:29.570 align:start position:0%
yes representative bunker
 
01:55:36.419 --> 01:55:36.429 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
substantive Stringham yes from Zenit of
 
01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:43.810 align:start position:0%
major yes
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.970 --> 01:55:59.980 align:start position:0%
representative ah Larry he's on mute
 
01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:09.970 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:15.330 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.450 --> 01:56:19.460 align:start position:0%
I'm standing to set yes
 
01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:23.730 align:start position:0%
instead of Edwards yes presentative
 
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:29.010 align:start position:0%
representative Ami
 
01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:41.730 align:start position:0%
yes well it is 18 yes 0 no one not
 
01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:45.330 align:start position:0%
voting okay
 
01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:52.710 align:start position:0%
vote being 18 to 0 on the motion for the
 
01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:56.090 align:start position:0%
second year the meals and rooms tags at
 
01:57:04.570 --> 01:57:04.580 align:start position:0%
289 million to 334 million passes now
 
01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:11.570 align:start position:0%
we've only got one two three four five
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
six six is complicated Skyway fund and
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
seven which is not complicated votes on
 
01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:28.770 align:start position:0%
tax sources revenue sources left do they
 
01:57:32.090 --> 01:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
are closer together than what we've been
 
01:57:34.850 --> 01:57:34.860 align:start position:0%
talking about it mostly do people want
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
to take a lunch break now or go further
 
01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:43.050 align:start position:0%
for a while it's noon
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah break break could we take a half
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
hour break then it means we'll be a
 
01:57:58.190 --> 01:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
little late oh I forgot we've got it
 
01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:04.110 align:start position:0%
might be kind to DRA if we tried to get
 
01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:09.030 align:start position:0%
through three it's it's three more
 
01:58:12.110 --> 01:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
revenues before lunch so that they can
 
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:22.710 align:start position:0%
that's tobacco I and D and rent and we
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
are pretty close to each other on those
 
01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:27.810 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of
 
01:58:33.110 --> 01:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
big the ranges usually yes original bra
 
01:58:36.110 --> 01:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
me and Edwards have their hands up okay
 
01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:44.630 align:start position:0%
perhaps it brought me reps enema bra me
 
01:58:46.910 --> 01:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm fine what's going to the three
 
01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
and then we start every great if we
 
01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:54.450 align:start position:0%
start at one o'clock
 
01:58:56.690 --> 01:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
can we can we hear the two bills because
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of people on
 
01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:01.530 align:start position:0%
the phone it's listening to that and the
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
revenues can we do it that way well the
 
01:59:07.100 --> 01:59:07.110 align:start position:0%
problem is that this revenue sheet has
 
01:59:10.730 --> 01:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
to go to OLS and be processed and ready
 
01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:17.190 align:start position:0%
for the calendar what would that work I
 
01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:20.670 align:start position:0%
think that would be fine have enough
 
01:59:24.050 --> 01:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
time to get the resolution done it's
 
01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:25.590 align:start position:0%
it's in pretty good shape but just these
 
01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:29.130 align:start position:0%
uh these numbers today right great
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
okay so we will do it that way
 
01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:41.070 align:start position:0%
we will stop well another administrative
 
01:59:45.710 --> 01:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
question to Jennifer on if when you do
 
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
it this way am I going to have to read
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
that whole document again when we go
 
01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:53.190 align:start position:0%
back to revenue instruments afterwards
 
02:00:02.690 --> 02:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
oh I'm not I'm not completely sure quite
 
02:00:05.660 --> 02:00:05.670 align:start position:0%
possibly yes since you're gonna be well
 
02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:07.290 align:start position:0%
I can leave out that party about what
 
02:00:09.650 --> 02:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates are about so yeah
 
02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
you it'll go quicker we have to do a
 
02:00:15.190 --> 02:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
separate one for the exact session yeah
 
02:00:19.610 --> 02:00:19.620 align:start position:0%
okay so that's clear we can we'll do
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
these three taxes we'll take a break for
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
half an hour
 
02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:26.310 align:start position:0%
we'll come back probably at one o'clock
 
02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:30.030 align:start position:0%
it sounds like on and we'll do the exact
 
02:00:33.950 --> 02:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
session and then we'll resume the rest
 
02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:36.980 align:start position:0%
of the revenue estimates
 
02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:40.890 align:start position:0%
so the first one is to Rome you still
 
02:00:42.950 --> 02:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
have reps of major and Tucker with their
 
02:00:46.610 --> 02:00:46.620 align:start position:0%
Oh they've just added them represent a
 
02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:50.970 align:start position:0%
major yes representative Edwards has had
 
02:00:53.900 --> 02:00:53.910 align:start position:0%
his hands up on number of times yes and
 
02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:56.150 align:start position:0%
then he took them down again each time
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay Edwards did you want to say
 
02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:04.930 align:start position:0%
okay Edwards did you want to say
something

02:01:04.930 --> 02:01:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:07.350 align:start position:0%
every time I've been ready to say
 
02:01:09.650 --> 02:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
something the person immediately before
 
02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:12.630 align:start position:0%
me said enough of it that you didn't
 
02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:16.290 align:start position:0%
need to hear me so let thank you let's
 
02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:18.390 align:start position:0%
knock out these budget estimates and
 
02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:25.890 align:start position:0%
break till one right Tucker you're a
 
02:01:31.010 --> 02:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
beauty you could have a shorter lunch
 
02:01:33.530 --> 02:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
period fifteen minutes 20 minutes we
 
02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:36.390 align:start position:0%
don't need a half hour yes well we'll
 
02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:38.130 align:start position:0%
see where we are when we finish these
 
02:01:48.910 --> 02:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
three so tobacco taxes in two and twenty
 
02:01:53.990 --> 02:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
we we essentially agreed with each other
 
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:00.930 align:start position:0%
i committee caucus looked at the the
 
02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:04.170 align:start position:0%
agency estimate and went did a range
 
02:02:07.729 --> 02:02:07.739 align:start position:0%
from 206 to 207 which is around it it's
 
02:02:11.150 --> 02:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing on I would
 
02:02:15.700 --> 02:02:15.710 align:start position:0%
like to propose that we just do 207 fine
 
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
fine and then but then in the second
 
02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:26.310 align:start position:0%
year the agency estimate is 201 point -
 
02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:29.250 align:start position:0%
you took that we took it but then we
 
02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:33.470 align:start position:0%
went up to 212 and we have
 
02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
considerations that take it down and
 
02:02:38.690 --> 02:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
take it up the ones that take it down
 
02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:44.610 align:start position:0%
are that people will know that there are
 
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:47.310 align:start position:0%
worse health risks from kovat if they
 
02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:48.630 align:start position:0%
are smoking
 
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
and that more people will not have money
 
02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:55.470 align:start position:0%
for the cigarettes the ones that take it
 
02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:00.090 align:start position:0%
up are what was pointed out to us by a
 
02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:02.930 align:start position:0%
lobbyists before Tove it happened on
 
02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:06.930 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts is banning menthol
 
02:03:11.210 --> 02:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
cigarettes as of June and that won't
 
02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:13.830 align:start position:0%
come into play for a couple of months
 
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
probably because the vendors will have
 
02:03:20.330 --> 02:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
stocked up on menthol cigarettes before
 
02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:21.090 align:start position:0%
it happens
 
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
and it is its impact is reduced by the
 
02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:27.270 align:start position:0%
fact that a lot of the people who will
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
come up to New Hampshire to buy menthol
 
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:30.770 align:start position:0%
come up to New Hampshire to buy menthol
cigarettes

02:03:30.770 --> 02:03:30.780 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
02:03:32.810 --> 02:03:32.820 align:start position:0%
are people who are already coming up to
 
02:03:34.250 --> 02:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because the cigarettes are
 
02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
cheaper and then the other one which is
 
02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:43.950 align:start position:0%
important to me is that on people are
 
02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:46.650 align:start position:0%
under an enormous amount of stress and
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
this will continue until we've got a lot
 
02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:55.110 align:start position:0%
of people vaccinated from the cove even
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
if they don't have it and people who are
 
02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
have been severely addicted to tobacco
 
02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:04.050 align:start position:0%
that managed to get off of it
 
02:04:06.590 --> 02:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
are going to be going back because of
 
02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:10.830 align:start position:0%
that stress it's not a very fortunate
 
02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:13.770 align:start position:0%
thing to think about when when we're
 
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
looking at our tobacco sales but that's
 
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
part of it so we went from a range from
 
02:04:30.190 --> 02:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
201 to 212 and I'd like to know on a
 
02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
Republican what the Republicans think of
 
02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:36.690 align:start position:0%
those arguments why don't we take care
 
02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:42.810 align:start position:0%
of 2020 first you suggest 207 yeah well
 
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:46.410 align:start position:0%
the thing is if it takes a long time to
 
02:04:48.410 --> 02:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
do one of these roles I was thinking if
 
02:04:51.590 --> 02:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
we could combine them after we reached a
 
02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:56.790 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:04.150 align:start position:0%
all right John can we do that or we can
 
02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:15.810 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
so Republican thoughts on mental stress
 
02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:31.690 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.339 --> 02:05:43.349 align:start position:0%
I assume took that into consideration I
 
02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:47.980 align:start position:0%
am here this is a little bit of unknown
 
02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:50.860 align:start position:0%
territory for us when it comes to the
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales in the menthols
 
02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:56.230 align:start position:0%
we did we did attend a hearing where we
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
heard one of the association's about the
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts banning menthols june
 
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
first we're really keeping an eye on it
 
02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:10.210 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:12.250 align:start position:0%
we are still under the impression that
 
02:06:19.169 --> 02:06:19.179 align:start position:0%
plan is a good number I think you have
 
02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:21.310 align:start position:0%
some good points about numbers dropping
 
02:06:23.010 --> 02:06:23.020 align:start position:0%
off but then being offset by other
 
02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:25.690 align:start position:0%
numbers and that's sort of where where
 
02:06:28.169 --> 02:06:28.179 align:start position:0%
we landed at we already have a lot of
 
02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:30.130 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales that occur based on
 
02:06:33.450 --> 02:06:33.460 align:start position:0%
our tobacco stamps being cheaper than
 
02:06:36.089 --> 02:06:36.099 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I also know there's been
 
02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:38.050 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation to sort of remove
 
02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:39.670 align:start position:0%
that band off and menthol for
 
02:06:42.979 --> 02:06:42.989 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so I think at this point
 
02:06:46.370 --> 02:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable with the plan number
 
02:06:49.530 --> 02:06:49.540 align:start position:0%
and only time sort of can tell if it's
 
02:06:53.459 --> 02:06:53.469 align:start position:0%
gonna increase or not at that point also
 
02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:55.630 align:start position:0%
within plan there is a little bit of
 
02:06:57.149 --> 02:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
wiggle room because I do believe there
 
02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:03.070 align:start position:0%
was a 5.4 5.7 excuse me addition in the
 
02:07:04.919 --> 02:07:04.929 align:start position:0%
surplus statement item two e-cigarettes
 
02:07:07.439 --> 02:07:07.449 align:start position:0%
as well so they're sort of have been
 
02:07:07.449 --> 02:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
as well so they're sort of have been
under

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:08.130 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
forming at this point compared to where
 
02:07:11.450 --> 02:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
we thought so I think there's a little
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
bit of wiggle room within that number to
 
02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
sort of scoop up those menthol
 
02:07:29.290 --> 02:07:29.300 align:start position:0%
cigarettes as well yes sorry major yes
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:07:35.390 --> 02:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
messy too people are coming in droves
 
02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
buy cigarettes in New Hampshire because
 
02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:41.610 align:start position:0%
I think you're saving better than ten
 
02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:45.710 align:start position:0%
thousand ten dollars a carton and
 
02:07:48.200 --> 02:07:48.210 align:start position:0%
probably the same people that are buying
 
02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
menthol now I'm buying them in New
 
02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:56.550 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already I don't think yes that
 
02:08:01.879 --> 02:08:01.889 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that counter factor that's
 
02:08:04.010 --> 02:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
another factor I hadn't realized this
 
02:08:07.010 --> 02:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
but apparently a very large number of
 
02:08:10.729 --> 02:08:10.739 align:start position:0%
the the addicted smokers that use
 
02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:14.070 align:start position:0%
menthol cigarettes are female but this
 
02:08:23.209 --> 02:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
is a women's issue I believe it also
 
02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:29.610 align:start position:0%
includes African Americans those from
 
02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:31.530 align:start position:0%
what I've heard that I haven't heard
 
02:08:34.850 --> 02:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
that one recently and our African
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
American population is one of our
 
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
smaller ethnic groups representative of
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
Brahmi and Devon Rodrigue have handsome
 
02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:58.899 align:start position:0%
Brahmi and Devon Rodrigue have handsome
okay

02:08:58.899 --> 02:08:58.909 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:03.150 align:start position:0%
um could we listen to Devon Rica first
 
02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:09.090 align:start position:0%
oh one thing I just wanted to add is
 
02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:10.830 align:start position:0%
that on our monthly report for tobacco
 
02:09:13.580 --> 02:09:13.590 align:start position:0%
we do include char on the bottom right
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
that compares our effective rates to
 
02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:20.370 align:start position:0%
other states and also speak to the
 
02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:21.810 align:start position:0%
health risks
 
02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:22.830 align:start position:0%
there has been a lot of I've been
 
02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:24.210 align:start position:0%
watching all the news articles and
 
02:09:26.150 --> 02:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
releases and there has been a lot of
 
02:09:27.890 --> 02:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
public outreach pointing to the risks of
 
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
smoking you know given crow virus
 
02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:33.450 align:start position:0%
there's also a lot of data coming out
 
02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:35.370 align:start position:0%
that's so far that hasn't had an effect
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
on sales in profits so the publicity
 
02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:47.130 align:start position:0%
isn't working which frankly I've had
 
02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:49.710 align:start position:0%
severe tobacco addiction in my family in
 
02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:53.190 align:start position:0%
it it's it's really hard to stop and
 
02:10:01.570 --> 02:10:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:04.490 align:start position:0%
representative AB Romney and then any
 
02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:06.870 align:start position:0%
Democrats that would like to say
 
02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:09.450 align:start position:0%
something because we're the ones that
 
02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:17.670 align:start position:0%
are the problem here I mean the 11
 
02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:19.590 align:start position:0%
million difference is pretty significant
 
02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:21.690 align:start position:0%
I mean that's all that's just that's a
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
big jump yes if you want a cup as I
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
could say a man and to have arranged to
 
02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:30.390 align:start position:0%
a one - maybe - OH - OH - or two or
 
02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:32.430 align:start position:0%
three or two - oh what a half or
 
02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:36.290 align:start position:0%
something like that yeah I mean that's
 
02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:38.970 align:start position:0%
having a change mate maybe the
 
02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:40.830 align:start position:0%
compromise that they want to do we can
 
02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:43.950 align:start position:0%
use as our tool one is the low end and
 
02:10:57.770 --> 02:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
then a million or two onto it yeah
 
02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:01.410 align:start position:0%
thanks yeah I think good points have
 
02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:07.110 align:start position:0%
been made both sides I think that I'm
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
certainly ready to come down from the
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
Democrats high thinking that the menthol
 
02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:23.370 align:start position:0%
effect is unknown it's sort of a new
 
02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
idea and may be countered by the fact
 
02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:30.390 align:start position:0%
that many people who buy menthol buy in
 
02:11:33.290 --> 02:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire already wouldn't be much
 
02:11:34.610 --> 02:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
add there
 
02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:37.170 align:start position:0%
and I do wonder about the effect of
 
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
covet and the the I guess there are two
 
02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:44.850 align:start position:0%
sides to that represent Omni has talked
 
02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:48.990 align:start position:0%
about the stress factor leading to more
 
02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:50.910 align:start position:0%
smoking but the other side of that most
 
02:11:57.130 --> 02:11:57.140 align:start position:0%
certainly is the the relationship of
 
02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:01.650 align:start position:0%
Cogan to the lungs and they're through
 
02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:04.380 align:start position:0%
that - cigarette smoking and I think
 
02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:10.590 align:start position:0%
that relationship has been there made
 
02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:14.570 align:start position:0%
very public and is well known and I
 
02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:17.250 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker said around an
 
02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:19.770 align:start position:0%
hour send an article at least to me this
 
02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:23.730 align:start position:0%
morning from Vermont and they're quite
 
02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:25.890 align:start position:0%
optimistic in their efforts to reduce
 
02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:28.410 align:start position:0%
smoking and in part it relates to this
 
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
kovat factor so given all of that and
 
02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:36.210 align:start position:0%
given the uncertainty place and I'm
 
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
quite willing to go down represent of
 
02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:42.750 align:start position:0%
our me Brahmi suggested a compromise and
 
02:12:45.050 --> 02:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
I was thinking about that about two Oh
 
02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:48.630 align:start position:0%
forums and sort of a place where would
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
come down to I think I could probably
 
02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:55.170 align:start position:0%
live with that I'd like to hear from
 
02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:04.530 align:start position:0%
others though okay Tucker do all four
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like a reasonable compromise to
 
02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
me I'll go with that
 
02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:15.270 align:start position:0%
okay I I don't like it but I will go
 
02:13:18.590 --> 02:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
with it also I've done too many highly
 
02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:24.740 align:start position:0%
addicted people who died on me okay so
 
02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:30.030 align:start position:0%
too little for 2 and 1/2 204 as a range
 
02:13:39.070 --> 02:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
in the revelry has sister Paradis
 
02:13:42.650 --> 02:13:42.660 align:start position:0%
finally yeah I did wait till I get
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
unmuted yeah the the tool for it I think
 
02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:48.630 align:start position:0%
I agree with you
 
02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:50.550 align:start position:0%
representative all me that it's going to
 
02:13:53.630 --> 02:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
be too low if any indication of what's
 
02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:55.770 align:start position:0%
happening here in Hudson at Walmart and
 
02:13:58.640 --> 02:13:58.650 align:start position:0%
the market basket and at the state line
 
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
the stores with parking lots filled with
 
02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts cars I don't think there's
 
02:14:07.850 --> 02:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
going to be any decrease in sales it's
 
02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:10.290 align:start position:0%
not going to reflect on people in New
 
02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:14.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire buying cigarettes it's uh it's
 
02:14:16.370 --> 02:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
going to be out-of-state people coming
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
up because of the ridiculous taxes
 
02:14:20.570 --> 02:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
immediately to ours house
 
02:14:23.110 --> 02:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's just my observations there's no
 
02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:25.650 align:start position:0%
objectiveness to it it's very subjective
 
02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:28.650 align:start position:0%
to be sure but when you've got people
 
02:14:30.980 --> 02:14:30.990 align:start position:0%
pulling up to a half noise gas station
 
02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:33.650 align:start position:0%
for the sole purpose of getting
 
02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:39.390 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and buying lottery tickets it
 
02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:42.750 align:start position:0%
seems to indicate that somebody screwed
 
02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:45.330 align:start position:0%
up and trying to tack something out of
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
existence gonna hurt Massachusetts
 
02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:52.530 align:start position:0%
substantially I do believe I have two
 
02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:55.590 align:start position:0%
cents thank you thank you
 
02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:01.230 align:start position:0%
anybody else I'd love to take it to 205
 
02:15:04.070 --> 02:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to mess up the console
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
nice okay wasn't arranged for 207
 
02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:30.590 align:start position:0%
million for tobacco FY 20 and a range of
 
02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
201 to 204 million for FY 21 and the
 
02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.070 --> 02:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the 2020 number 207
 
02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:00.130 align:start position:0%
million and for the 2021 number is a
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
range of 201 to 204 million

02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you yes was any of all me yes vote
 
02:17:38.230 --> 02:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
is 17 yes 0 no and 1 not voting
 
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you the vote beings 17 to 0 the
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
motion for tobacco taxes at 207 million
 
02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
in 2020 in FY 22 a range of 201 low to
 
02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:06.590 align:start position:0%
204 high in 2020 in FY 21 passes and I
 
02:18:10.719 --> 02:18:10.729 align:start position:0%
hope it will be on the chart shortly
 
02:18:19.759 --> 02:18:19.769 align:start position:0%
here we come right so the next one on
 
02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:24.450 align:start position:0%
that that is DRA is interest in
 
02:18:28.879 --> 02:18:28.889 align:start position:0%
dividends tax you think we'd be far off
 
02:18:36.100 --> 02:18:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
Democratic range my proposed range is
 
02:18:50.290 --> 02:18:50.300 align:start position:0%
108 to 118 million in 2020 and the
 
02:18:56.240 --> 02:18:56.250 align:start position:0%
represent majors is 109 that is one oh
 
02:19:00.259 --> 02:19:00.269 align:start position:0%
eight point eight to thirteen eleven to
 
02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:09.050 align:start position:0%
one thirteen point three so and then in
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
2021 we both made a range around the
 
02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:20.670 align:start position:0%
agency's recommendation on the
 
02:19:24.379 --> 02:19:24.389 align:start position:0%
Democratic range is 85 to a hundred and
 
02:19:28.759 --> 02:19:28.769 align:start position:0%
five 10/10 in either direction and the
 
02:19:31.240 --> 02:19:31.250 align:start position:0%
Republican range is five in
 
02:19:37.720 --> 02:19:37.730 align:start position:0%
action so maybe for 2021 we could just
 
02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
compromise on a range of seven in either
 
02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:06.550 align:start position:0%
direction that would be 100 and and too
 
02:20:17.820 --> 02:20:17.830 align:start position:0%
high and AD no 92 low no what am i doing
 
02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:33.250 align:start position:0%
in d8 low on in 20 we've got we
 
02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:35.930 align:start position:0%
essentially agree on the low number
 
02:20:39.610 --> 02:20:39.620 align:start position:0%
either 108 or a hundred and eight point
 
02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
eight and the Republicans are lower by
 
02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:52.190 align:start position:0%
four point seven million in their
 
02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
highest would represent all me Brahmi
 
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
yes so you do what you mentioned about
 
02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:28.870 align:start position:0%
seven each way whatever
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:33.090 align:start position:0%
seven each way whatever
[Music]

02:21:33.090 --> 02:21:33.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.261 --> 02:21:37.271 align:start position:0%
but you finished about there the
 
02:21:48.511 --> 02:21:48.521 align:start position:0%
calculations as well yes well when he
 
02:21:54.450 --> 02:21:54.460 align:start position:0%
talks I believe about a fair amount of
 
02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:07.450 align:start position:0%
these things in Ind that that we believe
 
02:22:13.410 --> 02:22:13.420 align:start position:0%
that the reductions for next January to
 
02:22:17.370 --> 02:22:17.380 align:start position:0%
June 21 the second half of the fiscal
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
year on would would reduce to only 10%
 
02:22:27.511 --> 02:22:27.521 align:start position:0%
at that point and I think believe that's
 
02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:33.910 align:start position:0%
how we got our higher number I don't
 
02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:39.330 align:start position:0%
know if anyone on our side wants to
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
discuss that one at this point but that
 
02:22:47.011 --> 02:22:47.021 align:start position:0%
that the business is in general do a
 
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
very good job of sustaining their
 
02:22:57.210 --> 02:22:57.220 align:start position:0%
shareholders and that when they can
 
02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:00.070 align:start position:0%
afford to they they from what I've been
 
02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:04.090 align:start position:0%
reading they actually are already
 
02:23:06.390 --> 02:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
cutting salaries in order to keep
 
02:23:13.290 --> 02:23:13.300 align:start position:0%
shareholder payments up as revealed in a
 
02:23:22.801 --> 02:23:22.811 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.241 --> 02:23:28.251 align:start position:0%
so yes there anybody that represented
 
02:23:31.961 --> 02:23:31.971 align:start position:0%
for brought me so well only that if you
 
02:23:33.551 --> 02:23:33.561 align:start position:0%
go to the midpoint of those two ranges
 
02:23:37.421 --> 02:23:37.431 align:start position:0%
were where two million dollars apart it
 
02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
arranged with so a little different but
 
02:23:47.671 --> 02:23:47.681 align:start position:0%
man I yeah - man apart at the midpoints
 
02:23:53.711 --> 02:23:53.721 align:start position:0%
so if if we take your range and and it
 
02:23:56.951 --> 02:23:56.961 align:start position:0%
by a million interests and that's
 
02:24:03.091 --> 02:24:03.101 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:10.060 --> 02:24:10.070 align:start position:0%
you mean my range and a high I'm just
 
02:24:11.411 --> 02:24:11.421 align:start position:0%
you shift it over
 
02:24:16.451 --> 02:24:16.461 align:start position:0%
we got a compromise or I guess another
 
02:24:23.411 --> 02:24:23.421 align:start position:0%
way of increasing we're two million
 
02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:25.070 align:start position:0%
dollars apart I'm trying to get it to be
 
02:24:30.551 --> 02:24:30.561 align:start position:0%
1 million dollars apart so you can
 
02:24:34.241 --> 02:24:34.251 align:start position:0%
either lower your range by a million you
 
02:24:34.251 --> 02:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
either lower your range by a million you
know

02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:34.610 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:24:39.371 --> 02:24:39.381 align:start position:0%
107 to 115 or you can take our or as an
 
02:24:44.741 --> 02:24:44.751 align:start position:0%
increase it by what a nine point eight
 
02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:46.700 align:start position:0%
to one fourteen point three and then
 
02:24:55.421 --> 02:24:55.431 align:start position:0%
basically you know so I guess I'd
 
02:24:57.730 --> 02:24:57.740 align:start position:0%
recommend that way I won't touch yours
 
02:25:09.310 --> 02:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
I'd recommend if you do the math you'll
 
02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:20.450 align:start position:0%
find it that that's in range and one
 
02:25:22.961 --> 02:25:22.971 align:start position:0%
higher but you've also gone up higher on
 
02:25:26.111 --> 02:25:26.121 align:start position:0%
the low end and no higher than either of
 
02:25:29.861 --> 02:25:29.871 align:start position:0%
us was then go do the other way then we
 
02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:32.410 align:start position:0%
can do one away point eight and
 
02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:36.670 align:start position:0%
had to lay into a high end that would be
 
02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:40.930 align:start position:0%
115 15 what about that way that's fine
 
02:25:46.381 --> 02:25:46.391 align:start position:0%
yeah the effect will be that we have
 
02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:52.690 align:start position:0%
come up different points by increasing
 
02:25:55.500 --> 02:25:55.510 align:start position:0%
it that way by 2 million it's going to
 
02:26:09.270 --> 02:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
increase basically on our midpoint by so
 
02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:12.250 align:start position:0%
one point one oh eight point eight two
 
02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:16.090 align:start position:0%
one fifteen point three it makes our
 
02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:21.570 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:26.530 align:start position:0%
Andy we've got lots of hands now
 
02:26:32.310 --> 02:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
Tom Shambo represent chamber yes to
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
Madame Sarah didn't hear one word that
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative of Romney said you didn't
 
02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:46.830 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:51.511 --> 02:26:51.521 align:start position:0%
representative chamber can you hear me
 
02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
oh dear it looks like his sound is gone
 
02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:12.690 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:20.590 align:start position:0%
okay offer is 108 point eight two one
 
02:27:25.341 --> 02:27:25.351 align:start position:0%
fifteen point three okay Thank You
 
02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
02:27:35.301 --> 02:27:35.311 align:start position:0%
I think I'm unmuted am I see more good
 
02:27:40.290 --> 02:27:40.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I think representative Brahimi and
 
02:27:43.160 --> 02:27:43.170 align:start position:0%
about where where I was going to suggest
 
02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's nice and I would just round up go
 
02:27:59.011 --> 02:27:59.021 align:start position:0%
to 109 to 115 okay rounding on these
 
02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:01.150 align:start position:0%
estimates that we really don't have a
 
02:28:04.950 --> 02:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
good idea on when we can to represent
 
02:28:11.631 --> 02:28:11.641 align:start position:0%
verb Romney is agreeing so 109 to 115 on
 
02:28:18.270 --> 02:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
represent Tucker yes I think that's a
 
02:28:22.470 --> 02:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
great compromise and I like the rounding
 
02:28:26.580 --> 02:28:26.590 align:start position:0%
I think okay thank you
 
02:28:38.100 --> 02:28:38.110 align:start position:0%
I represent a major agree well we have a
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
a vote possibility here the clerk will
 
02:28:48.961 --> 02:28:48.971 align:start position:0%
call the roll on interest and dividends
 
02:28:57.091 --> 02:28:57.101 align:start position:0%
in FY 21:09 too high of 115 million and
 
02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:02.170 align:start position:0%
in interest and dividends FY 21 low of
 
02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
88 too high of 102 million no no no 92
 
02:29:26.370 --> 02:29:26.380 align:start position:0%
92 going between our two ranges and 92
 
02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:36.010 align:start position:0%
would take us considerably lower than 88
 
02:29:46.979 --> 02:29:46.989 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:54.099 --> 02:29:54.109 align:start position:0%
this is for estimates 109 to 115 for
 
02:29:59.279 --> 02:29:59.289 align:start position:0%
2020 and 88 million to 1/2 million for
 
02:30:05.399 --> 02:30:05.409 align:start position:0%
2021 huh representative Ames oh yes
 
02:30:08.670 --> 02:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
Carrick yes
 
02:30:19.409 --> 02:30:19.419 align:start position:0%
Southworth oh no yes
 
02:30:22.659 --> 02:30:22.669 align:start position:0%
clerk oh yes perhaps and of Schamberg
 
02:30:22.669 --> 02:30:25.109 align:start position:0%

estimates thank you on the vote being 17
 
02:31:31.389 --> 02:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
to see me the motion for interest and
 
02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:38.499 align:start position:0%
dividends FY 2109 too high of 115 and
 
02:31:42.909 --> 02:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends FY 21 low of 90
 
02:31:50.739 --> 02:31:50.749 align:start position:0%
of 88 high of 102 passes and we are at
 
02:31:54.219 --> 02:31:54.229 align:start position:0%
our last tax of the morning it's not
 
02:31:57.460 --> 02:31:57.470 align:start position:0%
morning but which is the real estate
 
02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
transfer tax
 
02:32:11.969 --> 02:32:11.979 align:start position:0%
and again we are pretty close in FY 2007
 
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:15.430 align:start position:0%
major takes the the agency estimate of
 
02:32:20.700 --> 02:32:20.710 align:start position:0%
150 4.2 on we rounded that but we took
 
02:32:28.889 --> 02:32:28.899 align:start position:0%
the on 105 154 as the low and gave a
 
02:32:32.690 --> 02:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
little wiggle room up because we see a
 
02:32:36.660 --> 02:32:36.670 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of activity still
 
02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:43.810 align:start position:0%
there in the in the places with major
 
02:32:48.090 --> 02:32:48.100 align:start position:0%
housing needs and I there was an article
 
02:32:50.370 --> 02:32:50.380 align:start position:0%
in my paper about it yesterday actually
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
talking about the whole state as well in
 
02:32:57.480 --> 02:32:57.490 align:start position:0%
the Realtors Association statements so
 
02:33:02.429 --> 02:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
we went from 154 to a high in this year
 
02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
of 156 it's not very much money this
 
02:33:09.810 --> 02:33:09.820 align:start position:0%
year and next year we seem to be closer
 
02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:17.950 align:start position:0%
to know I'm the lower closer so that's
 
02:33:27.770 --> 02:33:27.780 align:start position:0%
for 2020 in FY 21 on we take a low of
 
02:33:34.620 --> 02:33:34.630 align:start position:0%
135 going up to 155 as the Realtors get
 
02:33:37.710 --> 02:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
better at the virtual showings and it
 
02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:41.710 align:start position:0%
and the technology spreads further in
 
02:33:47.639 --> 02:33:47.649 align:start position:0%
the state found a and representing major
 
02:33:50.250 --> 02:33:50.260 align:start position:0%
takes one hundred and thirty five point
 
02:33:54.719 --> 02:33:54.729 align:start position:0%
seven to a hundred and forty nine point
 
02:33:58.800 --> 02:33:58.810 align:start position:0%
two the agency estimate was one hundred
 
02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:02.290 align:start position:0%
and thirty five point seven so we all
 
02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:06.280 align:start position:0%
are are thinking that it might be better
 
02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:08.770 align:start position:0%
than the agency is thinking so maybe we
 
02:34:12.240 --> 02:34:12.250 align:start position:0%
ought to start represent major do you
 
02:34:12.250 --> 02:34:12.580 align:start position:0%
ought to start represent major do you
want

02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:12.590 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
to say something before we asked the
 
02:34:18.310 --> 02:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
agency yes okay we're not that far apart
 
02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:22.450 align:start position:0%
so what I would recommend that for FY
 
02:34:29.530 --> 02:34:29.540 align:start position:0%
2008 greed or 155mm and FY 21 we agree
 
02:34:35.320 --> 02:34:35.330 align:start position:0%
to a spread of 135 - 150 - 135 - 150 -
 
02:34:38.410 --> 02:34:38.420 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:42.200 align:start position:0%
is is there further discussion on this
 
02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:45.510 align:start position:0%
is is there further discussion on this
one

02:34:45.510 --> 02:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:51.530 align:start position:0%
or are we we all willing to compromise
 
02:34:53.219 --> 02:34:53.229 align:start position:0%
on them
 
02:35:02.050 --> 02:35:02.060 align:start position:0%
okay well we'll have the on the clerk

02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:18.200 align:start position:0%

02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:23.570 align:start position:0%
