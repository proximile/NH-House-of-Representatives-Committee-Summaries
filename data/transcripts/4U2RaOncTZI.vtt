home and um
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to see all of his
 
00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
friends and he basically showed us how
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
to die with
 
00:26:39.789 --> 00:26:39.799 align:start position:0%

00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
weeks in fact Lun and I said he's going
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
to have to take a deed if he stayed any
 
00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.669 align:start position:0%
to have to take a deed if he stayed any
longer

00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
there um but he accomplished the goal
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to there was a line of
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
people that just kept coming
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
in uh friends from the past that he
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
hadn't seen for a long time teammates he
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
was a big basketball
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
player and a lot of his teammates came
 
00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
in we had a chance as a caucus to meet
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
with him on on several
 
00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
occasions and
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
guy for 38
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
years he worked for the Department of
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
Education in adult
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
education and he provided The Voice
 
00:27:33.789 --> 00:27:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
voice the number of people that had a
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
second chance and their education
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
heart was
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
enormous and he always said to me that
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
uh that was his goal in life was to make
 
00:27:48.039 --> 00:27:48.950 align:start position:0%
uh that was his goal in life was to make
sure

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:27:51.549 --> 00:27:51.559 align:start position:0%
that those who might have made some
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
mistakes early on in their life that
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
they'd have another second chance and he
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
basically provided that with the of
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
adult education programs that he
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
sponsored and worked with to make sure
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
that those Stu those individuals who
 
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to have that second chance would
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
have that second
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
chance he did
 
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
that so he's
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
gone but he
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
leaves strong
 
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
memories for those of us that are still
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
here and the challenge I mean one of the
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
things he was really advocate for as you
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
know as he sat in that chair over there
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
talking about feeding
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
kids and you're going to see probably
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
the quote of Feed the damn kids which is
 
00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:40.039 align:start position:0%
what he said all the
 
00:28:42.509 --> 00:28:42.519 align:start position:0%
time so hopefully the legislature at
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
some point in time will feed the damn
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
kids so uh thank you Mr chair and we
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
have a moment of silence I'd appreciate
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:08.549 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
you okay now let's we have to jump into
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
business here we have Senator Dave
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
Waters here in front of us and Dave
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters I can't be there uh saw
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
you yesterday I call you Dave then uh
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
relative to establishing an Advisory
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
Group to examine potential funding
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
sources for Career and Technical
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
education construction and renovation I
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
re recognize Senator Waters I thank you
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
it's nice to to see you all uh even on
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
this this sad day of commemoration um I
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
am Senator David Waters District 4
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
introducing Senate Bill 441 relatives
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
establish en visory group to examine
 
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.230 align:start position:0%
establish en visory group to examine
potential

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
funding sources for Career and Technical
 
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.750 align:start position:0%
funding sources for Career and Technical
education

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation and uh Mr
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
chairman as I was walking over here as
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
remind I think it's been 12 years you
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
and I have been working on CTE issues
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
and um you know I would say that uh this
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
committee um has done an extraordinary
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
job over the years trying to improve
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
that that system and here's one more
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
important step uh building on what was
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
done the last uh few years and
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
particularly the study um committee Mr
 
00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:24.039 align:start position:0%
chairman that you had a couple of years
 
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
ago which suggested some very very very
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
good things and uh despite all the ups
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
and downs of the economy and enrollments
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
and so on the CTE system is is doing
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
really well it's great job of making
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
sure that young people have opportuni to
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
pursue their their dreams and contribute
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire economy now this
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
issue about the CTE construction
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
renovation has been before us um for for
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
several years particularly because we're
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
nearing the end of the 20year cycle um
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
through which we provide funding for
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
schools to build or renovate the CTE
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
centers and uh about five or six years
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
ago we first had an informal committee
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
that said is this really the best way to
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
do things that just go through the crank
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
through the list for another 20 years um
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
and there's been increasing pressure on
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
the capacity of the capital budget to
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
handle the two usually the two projects
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
a year and sometimes for communities to
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
come up with their 25% match through
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
votes for their their bonding and so um
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
there were kind of a lot of discussions
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
and you know I a discussion with
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner a to about you know can we
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
be more Innovative can respond more to
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
changes in the economy and Workforce
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
needs by targeting some funding for CTE
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
renovation to those programs and to
 
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
facilities that may not need a whole
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
renovation but there's a new welding
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
program say or um a new Medtech program
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
or you know to be able to look at look
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
at that and um might we also look at new
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
ways of having partnership among CTE and
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
then particularly as this been indicates
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
um with the community college system um
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
as we're moving so much to you know dual
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
and concurrent enrollment to kind of
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
have this great blend between High
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
School CTE into the Community College uh
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
system and and degrees and credentialing
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
that maybe we could relook at this issue
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
so that's what um this bill bill does as
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's a kind of a broad
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
charge to it um to look at statutes
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and current and
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
possible funding sources for Career and
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
Technical education construction
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
renovation um you'll see that the
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education is going to um
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
appoint this this group to do the the
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
work and the folks are listed there and
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
you'll see the presence of the
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
chancellor of the Community College uh
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
system um a president of one of the
 
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
community colleges Regional
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
CTE uh directors um and uh and a couple
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
of uh District level administrators so
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
we think that's the kind of group that
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
can really get their hands hands around
 
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
us and tell you know what actually um
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
can we do um and then please note on
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
line 16 have a general charge look at
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
all the funding all the possible ways of
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
going at this but on line 16 and 7 is
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
where we get really to some of the heart
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
of the matter do particularly look at
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
how we might think about facilities that
 
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
could be constructed to be shared by
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
ccsnh and CTE programs um there was
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
considerable discussion in the last year
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
or two has conquered which is bursting
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
of the seams and it CTE programs the the
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
high school in general um would there be
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
a way to locate some of its CTE programs
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
at the um
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
technical uh college and uh or might we
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
look at more comprehensive kind of
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
regional that would bring together
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
several the community colleges and
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
CTE um the way kind of you know the way
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
we see kind of a regional center down in
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
down in Manchester so um I think there's
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
great potential here um for expanding
 
00:33:59.950 --> 00:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
the funding possibilities for these and
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
also for really making that kind of a
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
seamless um move and you know also a lot
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
of the CTE programs now doing CTE after
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
dark where they let um uh employers and
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
other kinds of Workforce training um uh
 
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
private folks Industries and so on use
 
00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
the facilities at night and there's too
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
another opportunity for students to
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know have a this kind of
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
this kind of joint facility so um that's
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
what that's what it'll do um we've
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
traditionally had the funding through
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
the Perkins um program for CTE
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
construction we hear more about that
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
from uh Mr beard who's who's here um but
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
I really also think there's a great
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to leverage more
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
Partnerships um not only with the
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
College Community College system but
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
with the private uh IND industry we may
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
recall that we do have a tax credit
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
program now for industries that want to
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
make contributions of equipment and
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
employee time for uh and and sponsor
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
apprenti ship and we have a federal
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship uh grant that came in to
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
the community college system so I think
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of possibilities here
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
we've had some informal approaches to it
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
before this committee I think really
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
needs to get it done what are we going
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
to do let's have a proposal so we can
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
move forward uh in the funding cycle for
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
CTE renovation and and reconstruction so
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you very
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
much Senator questions for Senator
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
Waters yes represent
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
leus Thank you very very much I like
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
your idea I'm wondering though all the
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
people I see here are all Educators I'm
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
wondering why you didn't put any
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
business people maybe representatives
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
from Bia or from particular Industries
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
or some to give an
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
industry perspective and suggestions cuz
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
for instance I know when we started ours
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
it was actually of vot tech and when Mr
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
Palmer started that he worked with
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
industry all over the state to get all
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
the things that they needed and funding
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
and Etc so I'm just wondering why you
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
just stuck with Educators yeah thanks
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
for the question and um you know we'll
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
hear from Mr beard and I you know this's
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of wisdom on this committee and if
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
you think that there's a a change to the
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
membership that would be efficient and
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
make sense you know and I the whole
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
Spirit of CTE is partnership the sector
 
00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:22.839 align:start position:0%
Partnerships they have with businesses
 
00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
and I put it together this way just
 
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
because I I think that that's just come
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
natural to them that they're going to
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to have folks come in from
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
the business industry and and talk with
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
them um it seemed to me that this group
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
though focusing on the kind of system
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
that the state is going to be doing with
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
its facilities that may be not as a
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
member of it but you know as you say I
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
think that's for your
 
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
conversation thank further questions ref
 
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:51.640 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you good morning Mr
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
Senator I had a question about the
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
membership as well specifically line
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
seven and eight where a says the state
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
director for CTE and B says that the
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
design may also be the state director
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
for CTE does that mean the state
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
director fills two roles or am I reading
 
00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:08.270 align:start position:0%
director fills two roles or am I reading
that

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
incorrectly thanks for pointing out you
 
00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
know maybe there' be a way to clarify
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
that a little bit and I let je Jeff
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
beard um speak to that it at the
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
director's state director CT ought to be
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
on it um I don't and but and the
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education may think that
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
it would be good to have somebody body
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
else on there as well okay assistant or
 
00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
others and I and so that's why it's
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat Ambiguously worded to let that
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
possibility there if the if the
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner thought yeah of course the
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
CTE director but I would like to have
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
somebody else there thank as well but
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
there may be a way to change that
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
wording to add something like um you
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
director okay you know how how to how to
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
reconcile those two and maybe Mr be have
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
some thoughts too but the intent was
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
that I I think it's quite possible the
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner may want to actually sit or
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
may want to appoint an additional person
 
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
from their staff who looks at the
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
overall financing things in a broader
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
way than the CTE director
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
might uh thank you very much Senator
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
would you please address the issue of
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
the current source of Revenue which is
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's not the education trust fund it's
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's it's Capital dollars uh how is
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
this impacting the community such as a
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
white field where they can't they cannot
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
come up with the votes to support the
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
25% match how's that impacting kids in
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
the CTE program thanks for that question
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that has been a um continuing issue
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
for some communities because as I
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned the breakdown is that we have
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
the Perkins funding and then through
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
capital budget the state provides
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
75% but the local Community needs to
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
provide the 25% which requires local
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
bonding and there are several
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
communities who have you know again and
 
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
again tried um and not be able to to get
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
there and so in those circumstances what
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
has been happening is that if they can't
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
make the vote then there's another
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
person one down the list that the
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
department of Ed can bring forward to
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
capital budget um for for those those
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
dollars I think there have been some
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
attempts at some rather creative
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
workarounds for that local contribution
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
but it it is an issue I I think that one
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
of the things this group may be able to
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
look at is that is that problem because
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
if we can expand the
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
Partnerships to this community college
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
system to businesses and to others and
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
other sources of funding it might it may
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
take some of the pressure off of of that
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
I also think that if we're looking at
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
this new model of not doing the full
 
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
renovate or not doing the Full
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
Construction that the budget might
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
become a a smaller um bite for the
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
community to take so you know it is a
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
difficulty if the community can't get
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
their new center can't get that that
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
past it does affect impact I think
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
adversely the education of the young
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
people in those communities y further
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Senator
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you I have to get back to a
 
00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
committee and uh if there are further
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sure I'll hear about them
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
but Mr beard is is here too we don't
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
have a pink card are you intending to
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
come and offer any technical support or
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes I'm available for questions I can
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
Good Jeff uh question I have uh
 
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:46.839 align:start position:0%
involving the higher education at
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
Community College with uh Mark
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein uh with the community college
 
00:40:55.349 --> 00:40:55.359 align:start position:0%
system do you know that recently in
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
another week we're coming out with a
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
high education
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
report which has several components
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
which are addressing specifically the
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
community college system and that is CTE
 
00:41:10.829 --> 00:41:10.839 align:start position:0%
how can they merge or work
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with you nhti and other
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
locations uh have you had much of a
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussion in this regard with the
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
advisory Council not with the uh the S
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
sp190 the the CT advisory Council we've
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
talked about it in a general way um I've
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
had a number of conversations with Steve
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
Abby um in the department um and just
 
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
the record of Dr Jeff beard I'm the
 
00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
state director for CTE with the
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um also chair um
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
the uh CT advisory Council which
 
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
includes representative Vlad and
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
representative uh Cornell um and Senator
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
earlier other questions
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
for Mr Beer
 
00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.030 align:start position:0%
for Mr Beer
yes

00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
Rus I was just wondering what your um
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
input on my earlier question was and
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
since it looks like you will be a person
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
who's on here do you think it's better
 
00:42:11.319 --> 00:42:12.309 align:start position:0%
who's on here do you think it's better
to

00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:12.319 --> 00:42:13.829 align:start position:0%
to
somehow

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
add some representatives from business
 
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
on here or will you just call them in as
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
need be because it seems like business
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be part of this partnership
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah business is always in is always an
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
essential partner with all of these
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
discussions um this uh this specific
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
working group uh sits alongside the
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
advisory Council um and we do have that
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
industry representation we have um a
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
represent for the the Auto Dealers
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
Association uh healthc care um the the
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
hotel and and um and Restaurant
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
Association um as well as Bia uh so we
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
we have those conversations and the
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
discussions my experience has been that
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
industry is always very um enthusiastic
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
participants but they want to have a
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
specific charge so my my thinking would
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
be to have them come in as needed um and
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
and really speak to some of the specific
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
needs particularly and Senator Waters
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
had mentioned this one of the um things
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
will be important is to look at any
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
poent potential disruptions uh to uh to
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
the economy to Industries so that we um
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
can really look at planning what are
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to be the needs over the next 10
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
15 20 years industry input's going to be
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
essential for that so that we're not um
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
um unaware of something that's coming
 
00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
down down the road thank you further
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
questions we have a few moments here so
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just get off Target a
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
little bit but ask you a question we
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
passed legislation dealing with uh CTE
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
calendars and aligning them in the
 
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.589 align:start position:0%
calendars and aligning them in the
regional

00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
regional
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
areas uh and trying to get those to have
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
more than 10 nonaligned days how are we
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
making progress in that at you know due
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we need more kids in
 
00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
the CTE program are are is the calendar
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
business getting squared away at all it
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
is the the regional Agreements are
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
starting to trickle into the department
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh they're still getting developed uh by
 
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
by districts but the uh the results so
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
far are very promising they have not had
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
the difficulty in aligning calendars
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we had thought might be the case uh
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
so we're making really good progress on
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
that um looking at how we um look at CTE
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
centers will also be interesting
 
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:29.079 align:start position:0%
currently the definition of a CTE Center
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
in statute is the um the governing board
 
00:44:35.549 --> 00:44:35.559 align:start position:0%
or the the school board of the the
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
district that hosts the CT Center so we
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
don't have a brick and mortar building
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
definition of CT Center nor do we have a
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
definition of CT program uh both of
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
which are are I think are essential as
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
we start to look at funding and and the
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
structure of
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
CTE further questions I got one more
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
when we have a center that auto center
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
that maybe is in Co work in cooperation
 
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
with Toyota or Ford or GM or
 
00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:05.079 align:start position:0%
Chevy what kind of investment do us
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
toota 4 GM or Chevy have in terms of
 
00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
dollars to that
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
Center they um they often in Center
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
Waton mention the tax credit program uh
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
they often will donate equipment but
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
there is a tax credit program for
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
donations of time money or equipment um
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
so that there's a combination of
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
students going out to do work-based
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
learning at dealership
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
text coming from dealerships to Auto
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
programs to work with with students in
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
the high school program but also um if
 
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
they need something that is a um a piece
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
of equipment that the the Perkins
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
funding uh which is the federal funding
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
for CTE can't cover uh very often
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to get something like a
 
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
a tire a front end alignment machine um
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
upgrade or something like that the the
 
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
dealers ships have been very generous
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
about donating those things to to CT
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
centers thank
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
you not seeing any other questions
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there is there
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else who wants to speak uh
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
regarding this
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
bill oh can you pass your card in there
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
here my name is Yan Fowler and I'm the
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
principal of conquered Regional
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
Technical Center um I just wanted to
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire Career and
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
Technical Association that is made up of
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
all the CTE administrators in the state
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the the 28 centers um we're aware of
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
this um proposed bill and we support it
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine given the situation
 
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
we're in where we're all at capacity not
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
just conquered but all the other
 
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
subcenters and smaller centers
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state um it's very
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
important for us to look at this type of
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and set up a
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh where we all have uh input
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
and say as to how we're going to meet
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
the demand uh we we have a lot of demand
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
and we just don't have the capacity at
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
this point uh to fulfill the demand and
 
00:47:04.349 --> 00:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
in a state where we want students to
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
work stay in Play We recognize how
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
important it is in high school in
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
particular to partner with industry keep
 
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
the kids here uh educate them give them
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
the skills and um to support the
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
businesses in the need so part of our
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
model is uh we have Regional advisory
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
boards that meet we have program
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
advisory boards that meet that are made
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
up of those businesses and we are
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
constantly monitoring how to prepare the
 
00:47:36.109 --> 00:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
students for the workforce so a natural
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
evolution of those conversations into
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
the um committee that will help make
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
decisions about renovation and R model
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
um is is really needed we need to have
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
this broader discussion because
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
conquered is on a city block and we are
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
bursting and we can't um meet the needs
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
of of the the student demand we're act
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
we're turning away students I have a
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
health science program right now
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
applications are rolling in at all
 
00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
centers right now I've already had over
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
100 applications for the health science
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
program and I have 40 seats so that's
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
just an example of one program we offer
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
12 programs so this committee is super
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
important for us to support that's it
 
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:23.430 align:start position:0%
important for us to support that's it
represent

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
so my question goes back to your last
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
comment you have a just in one program
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
100 with 40 seats how do you determine
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
which 40 participate in that program and
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
what happens to to the other 60 that
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
aren't in the program so um it's a blind
 
00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
application process where we ask three
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
questions of the student like why do you
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
want the career ask them to tell us a
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
little bit about themselves um and we
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
ask what this particular being accepted
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
in the program would do for them and
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
their future goals we also have a copy
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
of their student transcripts and we look
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
at attendance uh these are not elective
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
courses as you can imagine they're
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
programs where they go to school every
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
day for a full year um so we want to
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
make sure the right student takes the
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
seat that that meets the competency has
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to meet the competencies for
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
example uh an automotive I I'm looking
 
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure they successfully have the
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
algebra skills that uh to to be
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
successful in our program so it's a
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
process and then on top of that we have
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
our regional agreements uh that are you
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
know committed with the individual
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
school districts that um we promise a
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of seats so we have an
 
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
intricate balancing act that we're doing
 
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh but it works it works it's um not the
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
best system because I'd love to have you
 
00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
know the problem of having uh more than
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
enough seats for everybody
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow please yes uh as a followup I
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
know CU I I come by the high school and
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
I see the buses dropping them off so you
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
have students as far away as kir correct
 
00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so how does a student ma manage
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
their their academic time with time on
 
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
the bus coming in doing their program
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
here going back on the bus how does all
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
that work it's it's a great question um
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
we serve 30 towns uh we currently have
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
12 high schools that we serve so you see
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
the buses that are coming through uh
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
most students except for the conquered
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
high students which is attached to our
 
00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
school uh will give up an extra course
 
00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
in their program of studies so for that
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
commuting time that 25 30 minutes that
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
they're on a bus they are giving up
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
another class in their home school
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
calendar how long is their block
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's different for the five
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
CTE that are in Vermont where there's
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
different scheduling there a course in
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont at the CTE Center is longer than
 
00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:13.640 align:start position:0%
a required course in New Hampshire and
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't gel with Woodsville or with
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
some of the other schools a real issue
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
it is the scheduling is huge huge
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
huge yes represent Damon thank you Mr
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here here
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Myer's
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry about how students are selected
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
in such a competitive environment is
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
there any uh attention or effort in
 
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.950 align:start position:0%
there any uh attention or effort in
regards

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
to the demographics of the students who
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
are enrolled in different programs for
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
instance young women in a welding
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
program which would have been less
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
conventional and many other examples
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
could apply um yes thank you for the
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
question we spent a lot of time in our
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
cataloges in our brochures uh it's
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
called non-traditional in the eyes of
 
00:52:05.069 --> 00:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
the federal government and that is a
 
00:52:07.549 --> 00:52:07.559 align:start position:0%
requirement that we spend some effort uh
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
looking into our program so we have
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
women in automotive we have women in
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
construction trades we're trying to get
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
males into the cosmetology program and I
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
think if you've read the conquered
 
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
monitor recently you saw a picture of uh
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
females firefighters that we have uh in
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
our program right now we're 50% capacity
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
on the firefighting program and half of
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
them are female half of them are men so
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
um we we spent a lot of time I think uh
 
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
you know the the all of the CTE centers
 
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
are aware that we have to look at the
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
language in our cataloges the pictures
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
that are placed in our brochures uh when
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
we go out to schools and we recruit who
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
who are we bringing with us um so we
 
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
we're consciously making that
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
recruitment effort show
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
that we're a diverse group so y
 
00:53:01.079 --> 00:53:02.430 align:start position:0%
that we're a diverse group so y
representative

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
Hall chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
question in terms of the selection
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
process let's say the kid who doesn't go
 
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
to school let they never participate in
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
CTE attendance is horrible but probably
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
because hasn't attended CTE is there any
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Teacher recommendations
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
does that play a role in that as well
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
yeah so um yes we do we refer back to
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
the schools we give all our sending
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
schools a list of students who have
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
applied and we ask them to make any
 
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
particular comment that they may have in
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
support or concerns that's how we phrase
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
it so we give them an opportunity um to
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
share with us anything that they may
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
have before making that final decision
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
yep in your in your I'll get you a
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
second in your
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
opinion uh when we looked at a study
 
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.799 align:start position:0%
several years ago and Jeff was part of
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
that we looked at
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
Delaware and we saw that their
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of students attending CTE was
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
way up above 50% where ours was down to
 
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
177% is there an issue
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
that that you talk about seats available
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
or space available are we talking now
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely having to do the construction
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
adding on your one small lot there where
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
you're right now or working with
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
nhti or some other institution of higher
 
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
education where our students could go
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
there to get their CTE MH I'm worried
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
about the construction that's huge
 
00:54:38.109 --> 00:54:38.119 align:start position:0%
dollars it is um so if you think broadly
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
across my 12 programs but think every
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
school CTE Center has a different U
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
program that they may run at in
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
conquered putting Automotive for example
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
at nhdi would make complete sense
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
however what do we do about health
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
science what do we start to look at with
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
our cosmetology programs what so if I
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
were to look at uh weight lless and
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
start to come up with Creative Solutions
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
it might be beyond the needs of just one
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
partnership um if we don't have the
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
ability to expand on our own location um
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
and that's concerning because you could
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
take the programs individually and do
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
that but also we have to remember we're
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
not a college campus and buses are
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
coming in um from from all these
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
different towns and then I'm adding to
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
their commute possibly if I go send them
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
across uh the city so I don't have an
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
answer that's why I support the study
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee because I think it's a
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
multi-prong approach we have to look at
 
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
and then the needs in conquer are going
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
to look very differently from the North
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
country and uh I think we have to look
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
at all of the different unique needs
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
that we all have and make sure we come
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
up with a solution that fits all of them
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you represent leus
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm going to follow up on the
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
question I asked the first two and I'm
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
wondering are you confident with the um
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
all the various
 
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
CTE connections with business that that
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
will all work or do you think we should
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
put some sort of business person
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
actually on the committee um I'm
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
confident that the needs of businesses
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
are being addressed both at our local
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
level through the program advisory
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
boards then also have a regional
 
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:29.720 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board and then on top of that
 
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
we have the S sp190 group with
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
Representatives on that so not to put
 
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
the same people in all the same meetings
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
all the time I'm confident that the uh
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
membership of the current uh proposed
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
study committee would work thank you yep
 
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
other questions yes represent Damon
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you again so i' be interested in
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
your opinion on this although I'm
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
thinking I perhaps should have asked it
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
of uh Mr
 
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.430 align:start position:0%
of uh Mr
Beer

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
Beer
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
do we need more CTE centers to DEC and
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
this is I know dollars and Pie in the
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
Sky but just as a broad Strokes
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
conversation to address the challenges
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
of kids time frame like I'm thinking
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
about the communities that are
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
northernmost in
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
karge that's a further distance to get
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
here than say Warner or Bradford by
 
00:57:28.829 --> 00:57:28.839 align:start position:0%
quite a bit um um and or it's clear we
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
need more capacity at the centers we
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
have but do we need more centers well um
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
and this is a little bit outside my
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse but the state gets a flat
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
fund right now the bare minimum coming
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
in for a Perkins right coming into the
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
um to split that pie with more centers
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
are going to hurt the current centers
 
00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion and and not
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative Nick to the group that
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here today I I worry about that
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
because we're not seeing the federal
 
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
funds that increase to meet all the
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
demands of all the centers as we're
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
fighting so to speak over the same
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
minimum standard of funding if we add
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
more centers the current centers get
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
less money and that's my concern what I
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
would suggest is Manchester is the only
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
one in the state with the current model
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
of a comprehensive CTE Center I Would S
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
Suggest consideration of a comprehensive
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
CTE program in the state a second one uh
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
to start which again costs money but
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
then the karge students of the world
 
00:58:36.069 --> 00:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
could take math or English or maybe some
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
other classes um with their interest in
 
00:58:39.359 --> 00:58:40.150 align:start position:0%
other classes um with their interest in
their

00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
program that's that's something that
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
could be considered
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
yes so novice here does the federal
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
Perkins money it's an amount per Center
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
or per student so um it's it's a a very
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
intricate equation so the amount comes
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
into the state and then this the
 
00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will calculate a
 
00:59:05.029 --> 00:59:05.039 align:start position:0%
lot of information from the K through 12
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
system of the sending towns that go to
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
that Center and it's a lot of data
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
points so I I don't want to misspeak
 
00:59:14.589 --> 00:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
what those data points are but that's
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
it's not as simple as you know well you
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
have so many students we're going to
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
take that percentage and give it to you
 
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
it comes from the student enrollment of
 
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
those sending communities and the
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
demographic and information tied to
 
00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.549 align:start position:0%
demographic and information tied to
those

00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
individuals yeah yes fnr is one of those
 
00:59:31.359 --> 00:59:32.390 align:start position:0%
individuals yeah yes fnr is one of those
data

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
data
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
points yes further F the question
 
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell just to get as a
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
statement to get back to rep's point um
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
the I'm on the advisory committee and
 
00:59:46.990 --> 00:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
the industry Representatives actually
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
are very invested and have better
 
00:59:51.789 --> 00:59:51.799 align:start position:0%
attendance at those meetings than we do
 
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
so um I I think they would show up you
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
know on their own at at these at another
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee thank you yeah further
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
discussion not seeing thank you very
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
much for coming today very
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
informative so with that we have no more
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
pink cards on this we have about a
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
minute before we start the next one so
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody has to get up and stretch a
 
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
4

01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
is did you see the spreadsheets they
 
01:00:50.829 --> 01:00:50.839 align:start position:0%
handed out in there yes yeah I got it
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:01:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.839 --> 01:01:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:22.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.359 --> 01:02:24.829 align:start position:0%
 
443

01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
443
 
01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:53.109 align:start position:0%
443
good

01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to get go ahead with
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
and which is Senate Bill 443 relative to
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
definition of school transportation
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles and I recognize Senator Sue
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
prentis good seeing you again this
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
morning good morning representative lad
 
01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
and members of of House Education and
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative L I think I've spent
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
more time with you today than any member
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
of my family yesterday so really yes
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
it's true so um and a pleasure as always
 
01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
so good morning um I am here to
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
introduce Senate Bill
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
443 um and this bill focuses on adding a
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
school transportation alternative that
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
are not buses so the SEC so originally
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
it was part of another bill it was a
 
01:03:50.269 --> 01:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
different section but we amended off the
 
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
first part of it and just are focusing
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
on the student transportation vehicle so
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
we are in compliance it's been over
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
reviewed for appropriateness and
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
compliance by the department of safety
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
so here are the points well the main
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
theme Here is that not all children
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
because of medical reasons uh because of
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
potentially um disabilities behavioral
 
01:04:17.069 --> 01:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
concerns um or just a completely
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
different school
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
route need a
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
fullsize yellow or fulls size any school
 
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
bus or even a smaller bus that there are
 
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
alternatives that school districts by
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
choice could enter into to provide
 
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:34.480 align:start position:0%
alternative transportation with all the
 
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:37.160 align:start position:0%
same safety considerations that are
 
01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
given to the regular school bus system
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
with the exception of they are not
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
driving a big school bus so we're not
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
going to make a school district do this
 
01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to offer a coste effective
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
or appropriate alternative If This Were
 
01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
to be approved so this recognizes a
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
school transportation vehicle or
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
alternative student transportation under
 
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
school bus laws subject to the
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
applicable department of safety
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
regulations and safety requirements this
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
statutory structure by using the same
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
standards it's already in the structure
 
01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
is already in place this just guarantees
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
that students get all the possible
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
protections again from a safety
 
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
perspective Alternatives student
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
transportation supplements the
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
Traditional School Bus by offering
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
unique Transportation solutions to
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
students who might need or benefit from
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
individualized or customized
 
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
Transportation so some of which I've
 
01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned already special education
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
students students with IEPs medically
 
01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
fragile students displaced students or
 
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
those those experiencing homelessness
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
and students in the Foster system this
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
alternative again if a school district
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
should choose to enter into it would
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
provide flexibility a completely
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
optional tool in the toolbox for schools
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
looking to provide transportation
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
options to the to a student population
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
that could benefit from small capacity
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
more customized vehicles or customized
 
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation this were to become law
 
01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
it would allow companies that provide
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
School transportation a provide School
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
transportation Vehicles services to
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
operate in New Hampshire and give
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
schools the option to contract with such
 
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
companies in addition to how this
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility benefits student populations
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
with Transportation needs it could also
 
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
ease some of the bus through challenges
 
01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
that we face when there is a particular
 
01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
need and after I mean I was only the
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
mother of one but and for half of her
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
education she could walk to school and
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
the other half she had to take the bus
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
but I was actually member of a there
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
were six in my family and if the bus
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
route when I when I was growing up if
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
the bus was out off time out of was late
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
was early had to take a different route
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
for to make an accommodation it was a
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
challenge for parents it was a challenge
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
for the kids it was a challenge for the
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
schools so this would allow the
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
department of safety to add the
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
regulations specific to this business
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
model again a company focused
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
exclusively on providing student
 
01:07:09.789 --> 01:07:09.799 align:start position:0%
transportation Solutions rather than
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
looking to rules applicable to
 
01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
multi-purpose passenger vehicles as they
 
01:07:17.549 --> 01:07:17.559 align:start position:0%
currently do although School
 
01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
transportation vehicle could likely
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
operate under rules applicable to this
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
this provides additional certainty and
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
Clarity and Rec recognizes the possible
 
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
need for differences in an
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
administrative process so again this 44
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
443 I'm so much better at what the bills
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
are than the numbers this year 443 would
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
allow for a school district if they so
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
choose to enter into an arrangement for
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
alternative transportation for some of
 
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
the needs that I mentioned providing
 
01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
flexibility and it would comply with and
 
01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:53.359 align:start position:0%
complies with bringing the safety
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
considerations that are in place for all
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
children um when they are in some form
 
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
of public transportation and we're
 
01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
talking about school buses here in
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
particular um so the clarity that this
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
would bring is I Believe essential to
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
this type of business model for school
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
districts should they choose to use it
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm happy to take any
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
questions you have um I do have a
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
representative from the Department of
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
Safety here they're not taking a
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but they will
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
serve are able to serve as a subject
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
matter expert where they have worked on
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
on this on this Bill thank you very much
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
Senator questions representative Miler
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for being
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
here Senator uh I'm I'm looking at um
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
page two of the bill hold on I'm going
 
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
you and I'm looking at the at the a
 
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.309 align:start position:0%
you and I'm looking at the at the a
through

01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
K I don't see any criminal records check
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
on here is there a reason for that
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
they're required to have a criminal
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
records check
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
even though it's not on this list they
 
01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
are and I'm going to talk to I'm going
 
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
to refer to the Department of Safety but
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
they're they have all of the same safety
 
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
consider safety requirements put in
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
place but they don't have to have a CDL
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
to drive one of
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
these yeah P okay so the followup yes my
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
my presumption
 
01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:20.359 align:start position:0%
then based upon what needs to be done in
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
Uber in uh an Uber service in Manchester
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
for example would they qualify for uh if
 
01:09:29.189 --> 01:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
the school district were to try to do
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
basis I don't so i' have um
 
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative M thank you for the
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to refer to the
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety on this I was not
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
considering Uber as part of this because
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
it would be a pre-arranged mechanism
 
01:09:49.390 --> 01:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
that would probably be routinely used so
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
not like hey I don't have a ride to
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
school today I'm going to call Uber uh
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
will'll let safety respond to that but
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's a really good question this is a
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
pre-arranged contractual agreement for
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
these particular situations thank you
 
01:10:02.679 --> 01:10:03.709 align:start position:0%
these particular situations thank you
represent

01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you and good morning Senator
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
Apprentice good morning for here could
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
you uh explain the meaning on page two
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill lines 9 through 11 I'm just
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
not understanding what that is saying so
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
I have a little bit of a disadvantage
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative Damon because I am
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
working from the bill bill that had
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
section one and section two so I am um
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm coming from another hearing that
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
was pretty busy so I did not have a
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
moment to drop thank you representative
 
01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
cordelli so page page two line 9 to1
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
the exemption basically but I don't
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
understand so except in a v in the
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
case except are you talking about except
 
01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.630 align:start position:0%
case except are you talking about except
in

01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
the contents not applicable to a
 
01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
registered required of providers of
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
school transportation vehicle services
 
01:11:08.669 --> 01:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
under the rules adopted by the director
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the file shall include um I'm actually
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
going to defer to the Department of
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
Safety on this okay okay because it
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
sounds to me as if it's saying that the
 
01:11:18.239 --> 01:11:20.430 align:start position:0%
sounds to me as if it's saying that the
director

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
could um edit out any or all of a
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
through K from being a requirement I'm
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
not sure if it means to do that or if
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm misreading it but we'll defer to
 
01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.510 align:start position:0%
I'm misreading it but we'll defer to
your

01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
colleague says represent Dr do you have
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
a question what a cont thank you so can
 
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
I just hold on start representative Dr
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
hang on just a second so representative
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
Damon I'm going to defer to uh the
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
department of safety to see if they can
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
assist with um answering your question
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to think about it a little
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
bit more thank you appreciate
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
that repres dve thank you thanks for
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
coming um so I just looked where you're
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
sticking this in the statutes and saw
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
that the paragraph before 96a is a mixed
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
use school bus that goes kind of into a
 
01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
description of the different vehicles
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
and things what's the relationship
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
between that and this is there any
 
01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
relationship you using any of these
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
different definitions in here well as I
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
had talked about
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
earlier there is
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
language what we're trying to do is make
 
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
a crystal clear representative drive
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
that this form of transportation is
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
acceptable and multi uh the
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
multi-purpose passions or Vehicles some
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
of the vehicles that you'd be referring
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
to in that prior statute if I'm hearing
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
you correctly it could be considered to
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
be tucked in here but for the purposes
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
of full transparency because it was
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
actually raised I believe in this
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
committee last year that there wasn't
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
the clarity that was needed so that is
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
why we're taking it a step further okay
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
does then does do these vehicles still
 
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.870 align:start position:0%
does then does do these vehicles still
apply

01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
to this part of the bill because it
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
talks about the multi-purpose they have
 
01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
their all there's a long list of
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
different kinds of vehicles in
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
here but this would be an addition to
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
that and have the clarity to do it and
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
give the department the administrative
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
capability to provide the language and
 
01:13:17.229 --> 01:13:17.239 align:start position:0%
the oversight okay represent
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
senator for being here um we've heard
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
obviously about the uh the the
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
transportation vehicle Le portion of
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
this quite a bit but the part that's
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
catching my eye right now that I'd like
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
to hear a little bit more about is the
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
what I would suggest is a pretty
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
significant change to the funding
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
formula for
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
construction um that according to the
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal Noe is going to cost the state
 
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
year thank you for the question yes so
 
01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
remember when I said I had the there
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
there's two there was original an
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
original Bill and section one had to do
 
01:13:55.950 --> 01:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
with school building Aid that's a great
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
catch on your part section two had to do
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
with the alternative transportation
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
section one has been amended out so that
 
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal note does not app thank you so
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
much for bringing that up great catch
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
representa Tanner thank you and thank
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
you for coming to our committee today um
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
when I was working in school and we were
 
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
working on like pass Passenger cars to
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
do particularly uh Sports field trips
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
and things like that um the drivers had
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
to have a certain amount of insurance on
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
their car um and I don't see any
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
insurance requirement in this particular
 
01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
thing Could you um you or the department
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
of safety maybe talk about that so again
 
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
I feel the department of safety is going
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
to be best to handle this but
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative terner first of all thank
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question and it is nice to
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
be here and see so many familiar faces
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the crowd
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
um this
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
because they have not been able to
 
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:00.280 align:start position:0%
provide the administrative Clarity okay
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
this gives them the ability to do that
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
so they would have to have the insurance
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks all of those
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
pieces to align just like they were a
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
school bus
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
driver but they're not driving a large
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
bus so on their individual Vehicles just
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
like when you re so I'm going to also
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
take this down a different pathway if I
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
register let's say a limousine in the
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
state um and that that as I would have
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
to have well if I register a alumine in
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
the state and I'm going to conduct any
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
kind of business I'm going to have to
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
have insurance on that in order to be
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
able to transport people in it the same
 
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
statute you have a problem yes so this I
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
I thought part of this was um that
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
private Vehicles would be involved but
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is only a business that is involved
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
because if private vehic vles are
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
involved for example I think it was like
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
you had to have
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
300,000 to 100,000 it's probably a lot
 
01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%
more than than that now liability
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
insurance you know on your that also was
 
01:16:13.229 --> 01:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
for the driver and the car um but if
 
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
this is a business then the business
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
holds the
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
insurance so you're not talking about
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
private vehicles at all you're not
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
talking about okay I'm not talking thank
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
you for the question I'm not talking
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
about personal vehicles that would Fall
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
Again under um Department of Motor
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
Vehicle standards so this it's a
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
contractual business relationship a
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
business alternative for the school
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
districts to meet the needs of a certain
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
population if again they so choose to
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
enter into it with all the safety
 
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions that were actually again
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
raised in the house last
 
01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
year further questions representa
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman good morning
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you for for coming um I
 
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
just if I may follow up on Tan's
 
01:16:54.679 --> 01:16:55.669 align:start position:0%
just if I may follow up on Tan's
question

01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
I know that some of the youngsters in
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
special education that go distances the
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
parents drive their car and get
 
01:17:04.830 --> 01:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for that uh being the
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
transportation vehicle um would this
 
01:17:09.189 --> 01:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
impact that at all
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
negatively where you have a new this
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
would this would be an alternative under
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
the just general umbrella I think so
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative wock thank that's a great
 
01:17:19.629 --> 01:17:19.639 align:start position:0%
question so I mean that's going to be up
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
to the school district and the parent to
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
make that determination again this is
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
just an alternative for them if they so
 
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
choose to enter into it so could a
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
family then have this as an alternative
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
and whether they would or would have to
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
would or would not have to use this
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
would be between the school district and
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
the family yeah okay
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
so thank I think so just to be clear
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
so where there is an existing agreement
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
between the parents in the in the school
 
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
district now this will not negate that
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
agreement the it's not my intention to
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative w not my
 
01:17:57.070 --> 01:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
intention to negate that agreement but I
 
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
do think that's going to be between the
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
school district and that family there's
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
nothing here that says that they would
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
have to sidestep this because that's an
 
01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
arrangement that's already in place
 
01:18:06.750 --> 01:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to address the many school
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
districts where they don't have this
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
capability thank you so much thank you
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%

thank you very oh represent Miler so as
 
01:18:20.189 --> 01:18:20.199 align:start position:0%

enabling legislation
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
correct yeah repres Miler thank you for
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
the question yes again it allows for if
 
01:18:30.189 --> 01:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
they so choose with all of these safety
 
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions put in
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
and we provide the oversight of
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
administrative Rule and law so safc
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
1300s are the administrative rules that
 
01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
guide um school bus or Pupil
 
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
Transportation there's two uh specific
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
aspects to it it's basically school
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
buses and school bus drivers so the
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
certification of both of those things so
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
as as it relates to school buses we um
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
essentially ensure that they're
 
01:19:56.830 --> 01:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
inspected properly they receive a
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
specific type of an inspection sticker
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
that shows that they have the additional
 
01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
require uh the additional equipment
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
needed to be considered a school bus um
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
and when we think of school buses we
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
typically think of the big yellow school
 
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
buses however there are a number of
 
01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
different options of school buses we
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
have uh five of them in our state uh
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
eight type A and B are our smaller buses
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
type B C and D are the bigger what you
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
would think of as a common school bus
 
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
okay then the last class is a
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
multi-purpose passenger vehicle and I
 
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
think that's what representative Tanner
 
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
was referring to uh in her um question
 
01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
which is essentially like uh a van or an
 
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
SUV that can be considered a school bus
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
and then that's all contingent upon its
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
use so if it's an SUV and it's less than
 
01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
a 10 passenger vehicle then it can be
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
certified as a school bus if it's used
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
for uh transportation to and from school
 
01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
or to to and from school activities to
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
and from uh School home and back sorry
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
easy for me to say so that being said um
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
in this case the way that it would work
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
is these individuals would fall under
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
that criteria that umbrella of a
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
multi-use um P purpose passenger vehicle
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
and that would receive a inspection just
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
like any other school bus inspection in
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire so that's
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
where that would fall in terms of
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
credentialing for the driver the driver
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
would receive the exact same background
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
check as any other school bus operator
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire so they
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
would be required to go through a
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
criminal motor vehicle background check
 
01:21:29.629 --> 01:21:29.639 align:start position:0%
that's done by State Police and then a
 
01:21:31.229 --> 01:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
second criminal background check that's
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
done by the Department of Education then
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
they must uh receive 10 hours of
 
01:21:37.629 --> 01:21:37.639 align:start position:0%
training through a certified School Bus
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
instructor trainer and then they receive
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
eight hours additional training every
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
year to maintain that certification and
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
then lastly they take a written test
 
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
that is comprised of the administrative
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
Rule and uh laws of the roadway and
 
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
that's what allows them to be certified
 
01:21:54.830 --> 01:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
as a school bus uh instructor so those
 
01:21:56.590 --> 01:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
same things that are happening currently
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
with our school bus drivers and our
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
school buses would be happening in this
 
01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
model that's contained within uh the
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
Senate bill um one of the questions that
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
came up was and I apologize I don't
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
remember it might have been representive
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
D I apologize was about Uber uh the Uber
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry I forgot who it was
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh so as as it relates I'm sorry
 
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
represent my so as it relates to um Uber
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
the difference being in this case is the
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
transportation company must be
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
exclusively engaged in transport in
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
student transportation so Uber or Lyft
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
those types of companies are not uh
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
exclusively engaged and that's why the
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
term exclusively is so important in this
 
01:22:37.229 --> 01:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
bill because it is only going to um
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
apply to a transportation company that
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
is uh contracted for this type of
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
transport uh as it relates to the
 
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
question um and this might have been
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative Damon so I apologize um
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
on the page two lines 9 through 11 where
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
the concern was except in the case of
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
contents not applicable to what that is
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh relating to is there not every driver
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
is going to need all of these things
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
that are laid out a through K the
 
01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:09.639 align:start position:0%
biggest difference being for a passenger
 
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
multi-passenger vehicle um you know
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
they're not driving a CDL uh bus Which a
 
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
CDL would require them to have a medical
 
01:23:19.629 --> 01:23:19.639 align:start position:0%
certificate so because this is a
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
multipor vehicle they would not be
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
required by the class of licens to have
 
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
a medical certificate so therefore we're
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
saying okay since this does not apply to
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
that driver they're not required to have
 
01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
that medical certificate in the
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
file if that makes sense hopefully I
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much I'm open to answer
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
any questions are there questions
 
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:40.430 align:start position:0%
any questions are there questions
represent

01:23:40.430 --> 01:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you you
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
have partially answered my question um
 
01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
so which others of those adk would
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
likely not apply you know to the medical
 
01:23:54.639 --> 01:23:58.629 align:start position:0%
likely not apply you know to the medical
examiner

01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
certificate um the controlled substance
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
test results May not require may not be
 
01:24:11.669 --> 01:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
license RS and dry thank you thank you
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
question um are there companies out
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
there already or is this something that
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
we're enabling them to develop thank for
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
your question it's my understanding that
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is something that's going to be a
 
01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
new Option and there's not there's not
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
um companies out there at least in the
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that are
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
currently doing it they are in other
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
states not in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further questions yes
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
rent cascaden thank you Mr
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
chair so my question is how does this
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
how would this be different than what is
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
already on the books for multi-use or
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
mixed use
 
01:24:56.109 --> 01:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles question because they have to
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
be transporting students right they have
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
to go through that process yep I think
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
that the B the the basic difference
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially is just that it's another
 
01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
option in the sense of these uh
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
companies are not going to have to be um
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
own like essentially these cars are not
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
going to have to be owned by the school
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
um because that option you know
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
currently exists or a transportation
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
company this the the main difference
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
being that they're Contracting um with
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
another Transportation Company meaning
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
that it's contracted solely for this
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
purpose and it's just I think another
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
option available to them is is my
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
it so doesn't that opportunity exist
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
anyway again I I I just know that there
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
is this is another opportunity I just
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
don't know to the
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
extent I'm a little bit confused on it
 
01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
too maybe like represent cascan each
 
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
morning I drive down the road and 25
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
through Warren and they have this white
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
van I think it's a Dodge or something
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
such that but they have lights on top of
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
it too school bus but it's white um
 
01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
now would this bill what would this bill
 
01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
do that's different than obviously the
 
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
person that's either got a contract with
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
the school in Warren
 
01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
or you know I'm just having a hard time
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
seeing the difference between this and
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing in Warren sure yeah I as
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
far as the the the the uh intent of the
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
build sir I I can't quot I I don't know
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh I I don't want to speak on behalf of
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
the senator I just um I know that it's
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
another option that's available and it's
 
01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh something that's a little bit
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
different I just don't know the exact
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
terms of of what the difference
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
is I apologize it's represent Tanner
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we in the past have
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
had a bill coming in similar to this
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
with the company that wanted to start up
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire and uh you mentioned
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
that there were other companies in other
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
states and I was wondering if if you had
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
any indication of what their safety
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
record was or whether they were having
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
any problems in other states or uh you
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
know what what the history of that is
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your question
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner um I don't have
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge of what their safety
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
records are um it is my understanding by
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
the program model that uh that we were
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
able to see that they do have additional
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
safety standards that are are in place
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the administrative Rule
 
01:27:32.790 --> 01:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
and law requirements so as far as the
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
safety concerns just based on a business
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
model perspective not from any any
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
statistics that I remember or could show
 
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
you um it it was the program was
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
designed to be to have a lot more safety
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place than what was
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
required by our administrative Rule and
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
law you're welcome represent
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
woodcot thank you chairman yeah good
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
morning Lieutenant if I may go back to
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
your explanation for representative
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
Damon's question I don't think I
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
understood it um on line I the
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
controlled substance and test results
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
yes sir you mentioned that they wouldn't
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
be applicable sometimes I was trying to
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
figure out I missed the the rationale
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
and I was trying to figure out if why
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative it is the uh it's my
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that the CDL requirement
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
is what uh prompts that that controlled
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
substance uh test to be done so because
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
they have a CDL they're required to have
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
those drug tests conducted
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
okay yes go ahead thank you so currently
 
01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
regular school bus driver the big yellow
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
one yes they do or do not have to have a
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
drug test they do sir because they have
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
a CDL license yes sir perfect thank you
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
chair you're welcome further questions
 
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you I'm following up on
 
01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:49.719 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock who followed up
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
on me thank you kindly so if we were to
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
amend the bill
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
to not exempt Controlled Substances test
 
01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
results is that feasible from your point
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
of view to implement that thank you for
 
01:29:06.270 --> 01:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
your question so currently it's not
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
required for anybody who who drives a
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
multi-purpose passenger vehicle so as it
 
01:29:13.950 --> 01:29:13.960 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now with the way the
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
administrative Rule and law is written
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's um anybody who is driving the
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
similar vehicle that would be used in
 
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:23.119 align:start position:0%
this model is not required to have that
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
drug test it does not quantify for that
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
because they not they don't have a CDL
 
01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
license so if we amend that um I believe
 
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:32.560 align:start position:0%
what would happen is it would then
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
trigger that any and all would would
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
need to do
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
that and would that be difficult to or
 
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
implement um that I don't know I it's
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
not done on our end so I I it would be
 
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
it would be on I think the uh the school
 
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
bus companies um it would be their
 
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do that we would just
 
01:29:55.109 --> 01:29:55.119 align:start position:0%
simp simply audit to make sure it was in
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
the file thank
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions of the
 
01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
lieutenant thank you very much thank you
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
sir we have one last card here from the
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
school administrators Association Jerry
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
one good morning chairman lad again
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
Jerry FW the associate executive
 
01:30:27.470 --> 01:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
director of the Newan School
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
administrators Association and I come to
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
this committee today to ask for your
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
support of SB
 
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
443 um we view this as enabling
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
legislation that opens another
 
01:30:44.189 --> 01:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity another flexible option for
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
school districts to uh put in the tool
 
01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
kit if you will uh to help transport
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
we've understand through the testimony
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
of Department that many of the safety
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been R uh have been
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
brought forward in previous testimony
 
01:31:08.109 --> 01:31:08.119 align:start position:0%
have been addressed and as I understand
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
it and um when we saw this piece of
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislation in the Senate I did a little
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
homework and a little research and
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
talked to a potential uh provider of
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
this um type of transportation service
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
because one of the things that that uh I
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
hear loudly and clearly around the state
 
01:31:29.669 --> 01:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
in Regional meetings as the in is the
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
incredible frustration of school
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
districts in trying to provide timely
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
and coste efficient transportation to
 
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
kids particularly for uh out of District
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
placements uh for perhaps transporting
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
homeless youth um and so that you aware
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
of how those uh regulations work when I
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
was in
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
sau6 we had a homeless uh student uh
 
01:31:58.830 --> 01:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
that was residing in stratum uh and uh
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
preferred to attend their High School of
 
01:32:04.109 --> 01:32:04.119 align:start position:0%
res of past residents which mckenny
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
vento allows which was in which was
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy so we were
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
transporting a student from Derry uh
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
from stratum to Derry to and from school
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
each day because that was in the best
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
interest of the child um the parent
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
didn't have reliable transportation and
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
so the school District was providing
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
that that option
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
um in the most recent in fact last
 
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
Friday I was sitting in the South
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
Central Region group uh having a
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
conversation um about this very Bill and
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
there were five uh districts represented
 
01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
some of the folks around this table um I
 
01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
believe uh Manchester Hudson Nashua
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
Salem ainson were all part of that
 
01:32:55.629 --> 01:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
conversation and they said Jerry please
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
if there is some way that we can have
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
other options to work with so that we
 
01:33:04.629 --> 01:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
can save in transportation we need that
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
business model we need that opportunity
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
uh as long as kids are safe vehicles are
 
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
safe drivers are vetted they have
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks they have clean
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
driving records and the vehicles that
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
they drive are subject to the
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
same um regulations as the school buses
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of of inspection and so in
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
talking with the potential provider I
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
asked those questions and the
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
explanation that I as I understood it if
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
I wanted to take my Ford Explorer and
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
transport a child from
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh a local U from their home to a
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
service that they needed as long as I as
 
01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:49.719 align:start position:0%
the driver of the Ford Explorer complied
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
with all of the regulations that a
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
school bus driver had to comply with
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
with the testing the training and and
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
all of those um requirements and my
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle complied with all of the school
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
bus driver uh School Bus regulations
 
01:34:08.830 --> 01:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
that I could through the umbrella of
 
01:34:12.430 --> 01:34:12.440 align:start position:0%
this company uh contract the service to
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
transport the student at a significant
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
savings um one of the districts that I
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
spoke with on Friday was spending $800 a
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
day to transport one student uh to a
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
placement because they had to use the
 
01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
transportation they only had one option
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
to use this would again it's enabling
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation the safety
 
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
protections are in place um and we look
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
for it as another option for districts
 
01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.109 align:start position:0%
for it as another option for districts
kids

01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thank you very much uh
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
leus can you explain the difference
 
01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here by the way can
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
you explain the difference between what
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
this is enabling and what the
 
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
multi-use vehicle does like what what is
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
this adding that that doesn't add thank
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
you representative for the question I
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
believe that and I'm no expert on
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation I can drive a car um my
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
wife might challenge that but I tell
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
here to tell you I can drive the car
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
um as I understand it it provides a this
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
legislation would enable an additional
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
business model if you will to provide
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
transportation thank you thank you
 
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.430 align:start position:0%
transportation thank you thank you
repres

01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
repres
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you and thank you for being
 
01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
here um when I hear of like an umbrella
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
business and then different people
 
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
underneath I get worried about vendors
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
and um some of the issues with vendors
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
for example in the contracting business
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
where you know the the vendor assumes
 
01:35:51.119 --> 01:35:52.149 align:start position:0%
where you know the the vendor assumes
the

01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:54.669 --> 01:35:54.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility um that probably in a
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
business model like a school bus company
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
like first student you know wouldn't
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
have and I'm just wondering if you you
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
saw any when you looked at the at the
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
model that you looked at whether uh the
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
vendor issue was a problem or an issue
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and I I harken
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
back to your days perhaps as a tennis
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
coach and wondering the first question I
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
had is I wonder if coach Tanner had to
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
drive her tennis players to matches once
 
01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
upon time in perhaps a district own bus
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps not
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
think um in the company that I
 
01:36:39.109 --> 01:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
investigated they have presence in I
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
believe two dozen other
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
states um I would see the vendor
 
01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
investigation if you will as part of the
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
due diligence on the part of a school
 
01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
district who was who would be entering
 
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
into the contract with with a company
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much we we have
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
one more card here and I'm going to try
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
to get this thing done by quarter after
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
because we have a senator waiting Ron
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
whitcock thank you chairman
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
glad thank you uh 2028 2029 I'm going to
 
01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
use your forethought here seeing uh the
 
01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
districts that you see them now
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
particularly at the high school level
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
they have a multiple of big yellow buses
 
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
particularly in the rural areas running
 
01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.109 align:start position:0%
particularly in the rural areas running
pretty

01:37:29.109 --> 01:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
empty do you see this as the
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh a plan or an option or dimition of
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
school bus driver's Transportation as we
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
know it now thank you for that question
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock I don't see this
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
as as replacing if you will the the big
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
yellow taxi option it's another vehicle
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
pardon the pun another vehicle to get
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
individual or small groups of kids to
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
where they need to go but I don't see
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
this as taking over the school bus
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
industry I I think that this is a niche
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair you're
 
01:38:12.189 --> 01:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
welcome further questions thank you very
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you for the opportunity just
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:27.229 align:start position:0%
 
driven

01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Sean Thomas I'm
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
with Demers and prol here in conquered
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
and here today representing ever driven
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
um so let me tell you I guess first a
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
little bit about ever driven so ever
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
driven is what this bill refers to as a
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
school transportation vehicle uh they
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
currently partner with over 600 school
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
districts in 29 States um I think you
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
know commonly they're referred to as an
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
alternative student uh Transportation
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
provider and by alternative we mean
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
other than a yellow school bus smaller
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
capacity passenger vehicles uh I think a
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
better way to sort of describe this and
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
and you've heard this from from Senator
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
Apprentice as well it's really
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
supplemental um and this gets at your
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:39:13.870 --> 01:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
Woodcock these ever driven doesn't
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
compete with the yellow school bus
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
industry um they can't right I mean what
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
what they're offering is sort of a is
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a given the vehicle size a very
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
limited capacity
 
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
and the intent is to serve students who
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
need or might benefit from
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
individualized transport so again and
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
you heard this earlier we're talking
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
about special education students
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
students with IEPs homeless students
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
foster children that's really um who
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
ever driven services and that's what
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 443 is all about so when it
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
comes to students who might require uh
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
these unique Transportation options
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 443 really offers
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility I know you've heard that
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
word already today but that's really
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
what's at the heart of this bill it's
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility this is a tool in the
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
toolbox of school districts and
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
importantly it's completely optional um
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
you heard Jerry FW say this and and I
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
know representative Miler you referenced
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
this before this really is enabling
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislation ultimately this is the
 
01:40:13.270 --> 01:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
decision made by the school district as
 
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
well as by the parents so I sort of look
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
at 443 in layers I think what's before
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
you 443 is really it's a foundation or a
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
framework and a very important framework
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
because it ensures safety um it makes
 
01:40:32.669 --> 01:40:32.679 align:start position:0%
sure that these companies are
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
regulated by the department of safety
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
that all the rules and laws that
 
01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
currently apply to school buses also
 
01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:43.119 align:start position:0%
apply to the student transportation
 
01:40:43.119 --> 01:40:45.950 align:start position:0%
apply to the student transportation
providers

01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:40:49.149 --> 01:40:49.159 align:start position:0%
um so that's so that's sort of the first
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
layer Senate Bill 443 it's really that
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
framework it recognizes this sort of new
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
business model if you will uh clarifies
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
how the rules apply and that all the
 
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
rules do apply I think the second layer
 
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
is even assuming passage in this let's
 
01:41:08.109 --> 01:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
assume passage in this becomes law it
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean much unless a school
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
district decides that it would be a good
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
fit that they then put out a contract to
 
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
bid and that ever driven or a similar
 
01:41:20.669 --> 01:41:20.679 align:start position:0%
service provider then contracts with the
 
01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
school district um so that again is up
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
to the school district and I think the
 
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:28.360 align:start position:0%
third layer is really parents parents
 
01:41:30.589 --> 01:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
need to decide along with the school
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
district whether or not this type of
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
option makes sense for their students so
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
there's a number of lay layers here
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
we're just dealing initially with the
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
framework um and then just quickly to
 
01:41:41.149 --> 01:41:41.159 align:start position:0%
Circle back to sort of the safety
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and Lieutenant o uh gave
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
you a great rundown but so this this
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
particular Bill
 
01:41:50.629 --> 01:41:50.639 align:start position:0%
443 uh and we were involved in the
 
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
drafting it follows many conversations
 
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Safety it
 
01:41:56.709 --> 01:41:56.719 align:start position:0%
incorporates the department of safety's
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
feedback um and it works and and you
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about the
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
multipurpose passenger
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle and representative cascaden as
 
01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
well as repes representative leus you
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
both ask how's this different and really
 
01:42:12.189 --> 01:42:12.199 align:start position:0%
it's sort of the B and and Jerry F
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
reference said answered this right I
 
01:42:15.589 --> 01:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
mean it's the business model right it's
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
a multi-purpose passenger vehicle the
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety basically told ever
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
driven we can make this work now you're
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
a multi purpose passenger vehicle as
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
such you need to follow XYZ rules and we
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
can make it work the problem really is
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
that despite the fact that they're
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
willing that you know they could point
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
that out and show us that that they were
 
01:42:38.589 --> 01:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
willing to work with error driven there
 
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
was still some uncertainty because the
 
01:42:42.270 --> 01:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
rules aren't entirely clear because the
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
rules as they exist are really geared
 
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
towards you know more towards the larger
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
uh yellow school bus industry and so
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
some of the things are still uncertain
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill provides is sort
 
01:42:52.719 --> 01:42:53.950 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill provides is sort
of

01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
certainty um and it allows the
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
department of safety once pass to sort
 
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
of do a little bit of administrative
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
rule cleanup specific to this type of
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
business model and that's the certainty
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
then that ever driven you know it takes
 
01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's it's an investment in time and
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
resources to enter a new market with
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
that certainty then they feel more
 
01:43:17.149 --> 01:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
comfortable entering the New Hampshire
 
01:43:18.430 --> 01:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
market and that's really what it's all
 
01:43:23.709 --> 01:43:23.719 align:start position:0%
about um so again uh same driver
 
01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
requirements vehicle equipment
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
requirements safety and education
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
background checks and I'll tell you I
 
01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
mean so there's so this bill requires
 
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
two background checks one by safety one
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
by education ever driven itself requires
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
its own background check so really
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
you're talking three background checks
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
and that's the same on inspections so
 
01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
this bill requires your typical annual
 
01:43:47.149 --> 01:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
inspection a specific school bus
 
01:43:49.149 --> 01:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
inspection ever driven requires their
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
own inspection so ever driven own
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
requirements requirements am respects go
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
beyond what's even required by the bill
 
01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
but the bill is sort
 
01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
of again a clarification of existing law
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
everything's the same the same rules
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
currently apply
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
um and a couple questions I just wanted
 
01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
to address before I wrap it
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
up I guess the last one so I had already
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
talked to with respect to the
 
01:44:16.990 --> 01:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative cascad and representative
 
01:44:19.229 --> 01:44:19.239 align:start position:0%
leus question representative Damon your
 
01:44:22.109 --> 01:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
question about drug testing So currently
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
as it exists with to multi-purpose
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles and Lieutenant lry
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
answered this uh the drug testing
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply I can tell you ever driven
 
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
requires drug testing so despite the
 
01:44:33.149 --> 01:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
fact that it wouldn't be required by
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
this bill they require it they they
 
01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
require ongoing uh sort of checks as
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
well um so if that was a hangup I you
 
01:44:43.870 --> 01:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
know I can speak for every driven and
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
say that wouldn't be an issue if you
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to specifically call that out
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
here in the
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
bill and just for reference with respect
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
to what's on page two and what what you
 
01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
called out there a through K these
 
01:44:57.310 --> 01:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
aren't the requirements per se these are
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
really the this is speaking with respect
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
to the file and what documents would
 
01:45:03.390 --> 01:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
need to be held in the file so I think
 
01:45:04.430 --> 01:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
if that was something you were
 
01:45:06.189 --> 01:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
interested in pursuing it probably fits
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
in a different area not necessarily in a
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
file or maybe in two places um but again
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's something we're already doing and
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
I think it you know if you wanted to
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
call that out specifically I don't think
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
we'd have any issue so that I'll with
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
that I'll wrap up my testimony again I
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know we worked closely with safety
 
01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
on this I think it's a good option
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
provides more
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
flexibility um you heard school
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
districts are looking for options and so
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
with that we would ask for your support
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
and I have a number of handouts with
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
I'll pass around to the committee and
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
this speak specifically to sort of ever
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
driven in their safety processes uh
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
included my contact information so if
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
you do have any questions please please
 
01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
reach out I'm happy to answer any
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
questions right now thank you very much
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative

bbon thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh average driver's
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
requirements uh can we see I have a copy
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
of those yes and that's I'll and I'll be
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%

thank further questions not seeing at
 
01:46:03.639 --> 01:46:06.149 align:start position:0%
thank further questions not seeing at
representative

01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hall sorry do you know how many
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
companies comparable to yours are in New
 
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh in New Hampshire I don't
 
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
believe there are any um you know and I
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
could be wrong about that but in having
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill I haven't that
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't come to my attention I can tell
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
you you know so ever driven I know
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
there's a there's another this hop skip
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
Drive is a does similar provides a
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
similar Service First Student um which
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
is your big yellow school bus provider
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
they also offer this service I believe
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
they call it first alt um so there are a
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
number of providers I don't know that
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
any are operating specifically right now
 
01:46:45.589 --> 01:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire okay thank you so much
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much not see any for
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%

James Gray I am state senator
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
representing Senate District 6 uh which
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
includes um the towns of Alton
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
gilmington and then goes down Route 11
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
all the way to
 
01:48:01.149 --> 01:48:01.159 align:start position:0%
Rochester um I'm also uh the Senate to
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
design for the University system and uh
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
because we have Consolidated
 
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:10.510 align:start position:0%
because we have Consolidated
Schools

01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
um that uh the current statute which
 
01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
calls out one for uh Grand State College
 
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
one for Keen State one for Plymouth
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
State and one uh student trustee for the
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
university system uh that needed to
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
change uh since uh and so I worked
 
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
during the summer time to uh to reach a
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
consensus with the uh people at that
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
time uh and what you see in front of you
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
is that bill uh since I drafted that
 
01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
bill the uh uh trustees have voted and
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
they would like to add um a third voting
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
member we've only had two in the past
 
01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
for voting members and they would like
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
to add a third one um I disagree with
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
that so I have not changed the bill I
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
shephered it through the house excuse me
 
01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:07.719 align:start position:0%
through the Senate uh the way you see it
 
01:49:07.719 --> 01:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
through the Senate uh the way you see it
there

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:49:12.589 --> 01:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
um the thing that I would do to the
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
trustees of the University system is I
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
would decrease the number of Trustees we
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
have and not increase the number of
 
01:49:22.189 --> 01:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
Trustees that we have uh and certainly
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
if you look look at uh the populations
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
that these student trustees would be
 
01:49:31.629 --> 01:49:31.639 align:start position:0%
representing uh if you have three of
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
them you've got the University of New
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with about we'll do it round
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
figures 10,000 and then uh both Keane
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
and Plymouth which would have on the
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
order of a few thousand uh so it's a big
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
difference in uh in that uh the number
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
of U students they represented there's
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
other things that like I said that I
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
would change in the University system um
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh Board of Trustees
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh part of the argument that they give
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
me for for saying well GE will you know
 
01:50:06.589 --> 01:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
have three student trustees instead of
 
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
the two that we have traditionally had
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh is that gee most of the decisions
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
that they come up with are are not
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
controversial at all and you know
 
01:50:18.510 --> 01:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
they're usually passed on a Voice vote
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
with you know no opposition well that's
 
01:50:24.669 --> 01:50:24.679 align:start position:0%
good and and but that doesn't account
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
for uh votes uh like on the the vote for
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
this it was certainly not unanimous
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
because I did not vote for it and and
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that there's a couple others
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
that didn't vote for it uh so again the
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
bill is in your hands now um if you
 
01:50:45.069 --> 01:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
decide that uh um you know two uh
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
student trustees as we've had in the
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
past is
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
sufficient uh you will pass the bill the
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
way it is and if you decide that there
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be another student trustee uh
 
01:51:01.030 --> 01:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
who is a voting member on the board uh
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
you know then you will make a
 
01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
modification uh this right now actually
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
gives them a better representation uh
 
01:51:11.149 --> 01:51:11.159 align:start position:0%
does not give all three a vote but it
 
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
gives all three of them a seat at the
 
01:51:16.189 --> 01:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
board uh so that they can talk but only
 
01:51:19.390 --> 01:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
two of them uh whatever the rules they
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
would come up with in the University
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
system uh for those uh which ones would
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
be the voting members for that
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
particular year um and I certainly
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
support the bill as it is
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
written thank you very much Senator gray
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
yes represent McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
chair welcome Mr senator in the
 
01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
discussions about adding the third
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
student trustee would it be one from
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
each school or would it still be the
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
rotation as described beginning on line
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
seven if in the
 
01:51:57.430 --> 01:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh what it says is that the three
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh members shall be uh student trustees
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
from the following education and then B
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
below that says two students shall sh
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
serve as voting members so they will all
 
01:52:11.310 --> 01:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
have a seat at the table all three of
 
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
them uh but just there will be
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
some uh way to choose who are the two if
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
you look back in the current legislation
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh 189 13 189
 
01:52:29.229 --> 01:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
A113 whatever it is uh you will see that
 
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh that right now there's a rotational
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
basis where two of them are voting
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
members and two I should say two of them
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
are on the board and two are not on the
 
01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
board so okay thank
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
you further questions yes represent
 
01:52:51.390 --> 01:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
laus thank you for taking my question um
 
01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
you had said you would like like to see
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
the number of Trustees decrease rather
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
than increase I was wondering if you
 
01:53:00.510 --> 01:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
could explain that um well the first
 
01:53:02.589 --> 01:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
thing that comes to mind is all of the
 
01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
college presidents are voting members on
 
01:53:07.790 --> 01:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
the board uh the university system
 
01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
Chancellor is a voting member on the
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
board uh look back at your school boards
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
that you have in your various district
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
is your superintendent a voting member
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
of your school
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
board uh I haven't found any that are um
 
01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
and C certainly uh you know it it brings
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
to mind that uh now if you take uh the
 
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
college presidents and the chancellor
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
there's four votes right there and then
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
you add if you do three student trustees
 
01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
that's seven votes uh that's a quite a
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of voting block uh
 
01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
that uh you know at least has um uh
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
conflicts in their interest uh you know
 
01:53:52.510 --> 01:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
of uh uh the board you know certainly
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
does decide salaries it decides tenure
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
it decides an awful lot of things that
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh but again that that goes Way Beyond
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
this this section of the bill uh in this
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
one you should concentrate just on those
 
01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:08.189 align:start position:0%
one you should concentrate just on those
student

01:54:08.189 --> 01:54:08.199 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
trustees and if you agree that uh the
 
01:54:13.950 --> 01:54:13.960 align:start position:0%
two that we've had historically are the
 
01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
right number um for voting members you
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
would vote for the bill as it is and uh
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
if you think it needs to be increased
 
01:54:24.430 --> 01:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
then uh one of you would be tasked with
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
writing an amendment that would go and
 
01:54:31.750 --> 01:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
do that um so and then probably when you
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
get to uh uh time if you've passed it it
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
probably would go to a committee of
 
01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
conference because
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh don't know that that I would vote for
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
it that way U and probably would ask the
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee to uh uh
 
01:54:53.350 --> 01:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
non-concurrent Westing Committee of
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
conference thank you rep and
 
01:54:59.950 --> 01:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
Dr thank you I was looking at the the
 
01:55:02.030 --> 01:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
the current statute and wondered what
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
happened to representation from Granite
 
01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
State College well Granite State College
 
01:55:10.270 --> 01:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
was absorbed into the university system
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
so there there is no person or student
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
who is now a gret State College student
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh certainly we have alumni uh that
 
01:55:24.910 --> 01:55:24.920 align:start position:0%
are out there um you know so that that
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the the legislation the way
 
01:55:29.709 --> 01:55:29.719 align:start position:0%
it is right now you know can be
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
fulfilled uh but right now again without
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
any students uh there can't be a a uh
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
that fourth category that you see uh and
 
01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
if in the statute you will see right
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
underneath that it says that I believe
 
01:55:49.069 --> 01:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
it's underneath it it it right now says
 
01:55:50.990 --> 01:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
two of those will be voting members and
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
it'll be done on a rotation Bas okay
 
01:55:56.310 --> 01:55:56.320 align:start position:0%
follow yeah that's what I thought just
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure um but if you're
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
talking about a year
 
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
term is it possible somebody's not going
 
01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
to be voting during that year term or is
 
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
is the idea that they rotate by
 
01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:13.719 align:start position:0%
meeting the way I've structured it uh
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
again the the university system would be
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
able to set up those rules on what they
 
01:56:21.629 --> 01:56:21.639 align:start position:0%
would uh certainly the way I Envision it
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
is that the voting members would be
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
voting members for the whole year uh but
 
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
just as you have alternates if somebody
 
01:56:30.510 --> 01:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't be there at a particular
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
meeting uh that third person certainly
 
01:56:34.950 --> 01:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
could be an alternate for that meeting
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
and and have the vote at that meeting
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
but uh certainly they also have uh Zoom
 
01:56:44.910 --> 01:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh capabilities in there so uh the
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
possibility of that probably is U less
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
likely that they would vote as an
 
01:56:53.229 --> 01:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
alternate represent
 
01:56:55.310 --> 01:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you thank you for being here
 
01:56:57.790 --> 01:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
Senator I just need to clarify if I
 
01:56:59.350 --> 01:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
heard you
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
correctly you invited us if we so choose
 
01:57:07.510 --> 01:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh to amend this bill to let's say three
 
01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
voting members and if that were to
 
01:57:12.589 --> 01:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
become the will of the house if it were
 
01:57:15.229 --> 01:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
to pass the house did I hear you say
 
01:57:17.470 --> 01:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
that you would block it anyway in the
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
house of conference I am only one vote
 
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
out of 24 representative and I my
 
01:57:25.229 --> 01:57:25.239 align:start position:0%
counsel to the person that would make
 
01:57:28.830 --> 01:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
the decision and uh all of the other 23
 
01:57:31.870 --> 01:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
Senators would be that I disagree with
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
it and I would voice my opinion just as
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
you would voice your opinion on any
 
01:57:39.310 --> 01:57:39.320 align:start position:0%
other issue that came up before the
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
house thank
 
01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much are there any
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
other questions thank you very much
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
Senator all righty I'd like to add Chad
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
Chad Pento from the University system
 
01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
street welcome Chad thank you charlot I
 
01:57:59.990 --> 01:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh and thank you to the
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
committee again my name is Chad pimel
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
I'm the general councel and secretary to
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
the board of the University system of
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I have pre prepared
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
remarks but Senator grade just covered
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
the background pretty admirably so I
 
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
think I can boil it down to three points
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
so we can sort of move you back along um
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
the first point is and again uh
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative D's question got to the
 
01:58:20.069 --> 01:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
the reason why we're here which is under
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
the current statute uh the syst is
 
01:58:25.069 --> 01:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
required this year to identify a graned
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
state college student to serve as a
 
01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
student trustee next year and we don't
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
have Granite State college students so
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you to uh the committee for taking
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
up this issue so that the system isn't
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
stuck with that bind of how to comply
 
01:58:41.069 --> 01:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
with its obligation under the statute um
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
the other two points I wanted to raise
 
01:58:44.629 --> 01:58:44.639 align:start position:0%
are suggested changes um and again I
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
think both of them were already sort of
 
01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
previewed by by Senator gray one is uh
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
as Senator gray said um the board has
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
been deting what to do it's preferred
 
01:58:56.470 --> 01:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
solution to that problem for a while
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately where it land is it suggests
 
01:59:00.589 --> 01:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
that the best way to proceed would be to
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
have three student trustees one for each
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
of the three remaining institutions
 
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
which each of them having a vote um and
 
01:59:09.149 --> 01:59:09.159 align:start position:0%
again the reasons why um a lot of it was
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
just sort of honestly just basic
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
fairness if you know there's going to be
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
three people there it didn't feel right
 
01:59:16.830 --> 01:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
to have only two of them be able to vote
 
01:59:18.109 --> 01:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
um there wasn't a belief that would
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
materially affect the um the way the
 
01:59:22.990 --> 01:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
board conducts business and it just
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
seems simpler the rotation policy is can
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
be a little challenging to implement
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
three schools three trustees three votes
 
01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
seem the easiest way to to proceed um as
 
01:59:35.229 --> 01:59:35.239 align:start position:0%
Senator gray said we the board can and
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
will comply either way but that is its
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
preferred solution and we wanted to put
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
that in front of you second um Senator
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
gray also mentioned the that a separate
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
part of the statute provides for a
 
01:59:50.430 --> 01:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
Granite State College alumni trustee um
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
the bill as submitted was silent as to
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
the status of the of the alumni trustee
 
02:00:00.030 --> 02:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
um in the Senate the Senate uh sort of
 
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
of its own volition an attempt I think
 
02:00:04.470 --> 02:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
to just clean up the statute added
 
02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
language to this bill that would
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate the Granite State Alumni
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
trustee position as well um our board
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
never even had a chance to talk about
 
02:00:16.229 --> 02:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
that um what the future of the grate
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
alumni trustee position ought to be um
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
and so uh we would ask that that that
 
02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
language be taken out so that the board
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
has opportunity to think about it and
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
put its views back in front of you um I
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
will say that the logistically the
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
problem with the granded state college
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh student trustee is that again there
 
02:00:36.510 --> 02:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
AR no more students there are still
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
alumni in fact we have a grant State
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
Alumni trustee on the board right now
 
02:00:43.709 --> 02:00:43.719 align:start position:0%
who's in the middle of their term and I
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
think if this bill were passed as
 
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate it would have the
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
effect of tossing that trustee out in
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
the middle of their term um which I I
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
again I I think was just done I I I
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
don't think the senate committee even
 
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
knew that um because we didn't have a
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
chance to talk to them about it so um
 
02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
obviously the Senate I don't want to
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
speak for the Senate but that's my
 
02:01:04.709 --> 02:01:04.719 align:start position:0%
understanding of of how we got there so
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
those are the two suggested changes but
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
the overall takeaway is thank you for
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
taking this up in general and helping us
 
02:01:11.669 --> 02:01:11.679 align:start position:0%
solve the problem of finding a student
 
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
who doesn't
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
exist thank you very much represent
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:01:19.709 --> 02:01:19.719 align:start position:0%
for being here in regards to the granted
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
State College alumni that would lose
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
their position as a trustee could that
 
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
just be fixed by changing the effective
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
date to be at the end of their term or
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
how far are is their term the current
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
term would is through the through June
 
02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:34.430 align:start position:0%
term would is through the through June
30th

02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
30th
 
02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
2025 um this that is an option again I
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
because the board hasn't had a chance my
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
board has a chance to talk about this I
 
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
can't say whether the board would
 
02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
support or not that but you are right I
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
Just for information yes the current
 
02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
trust granted State Alumni trustees term
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%

a bachelor's degree required uh there's
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
number of issues within the bill which
 
02:04:55.149 --> 02:04:55.159 align:start position:0%

02:05:38.109 --> 02:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
Hawkins good morning good morning Mr
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
the record Brian Hawkins representing
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
Nea New Hampshire um my comments on the
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill
 
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
374 are relatively brief um we did
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to this bill in
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate um unfortunately it was um
 
02:06:00.189 --> 02:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
exec that um morning and sent on an
 
02:06:03.069 --> 02:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
addendum calendar to be voted on by the
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
Senate 48 hours later and so it was very
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
quickly handled and um there were no uh
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
changes made to to the bill to
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
accommodate um concerns so uh our
 
02:06:22.109 --> 02:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
opposition I think is very similar to
 
02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
what you heard uh president Tuttle
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
testify to on the original version of of
 
02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.149 align:start position:0%
testify to on the original version of of
hb1

02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
02:06:31.709 --> 02:06:31.719 align:start position:0%
1298 um the
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
um the way uh the bill is written um
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
other than the 30 working less than 30
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
hours there's really not much criteria
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
in there um beyond that and so
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I would just say is
 
02:06:53.589 --> 02:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
we do have other um ways to go at this
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
issue uh we have the emergency
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
certifications that this committee uh
 
02:07:01.229 --> 02:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
allowed for an extension of for one year
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
so going from one year to two years um
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
and uh we also have the ability to do
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
alternative certifications because there
 
02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
are part-time teachers uh in our schools
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
they're just uh certified and they have
 
02:07:21.549 --> 02:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
uh had the chance to um to uh experience
 
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
experience uh feedback on their on their
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
work and um uh or they are working
 
02:07:31.549 --> 02:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
toward um a certification and so the
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll just bring up is the on
 
02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
line 8 it states that the uh
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
educator um subject to the code of
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
conduct and the code of
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
ethics um if the person is not certified
 
02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
I don't see how that um someone's
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
license can be taken there can be taken
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
action on if um if they don't have a
 
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
license so uh so that that would be uh I
 
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
think you've heard that from the
 
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
Department a number of times about the
 
02:08:07.470 --> 02:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
importance of that and the importance of
 
02:08:10.629 --> 02:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
that uh so that you know if there is an
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
educator in one District they have
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
action taken on their license that is
 
02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
you know understood by other uh
 
02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
districts um and so I'm not sure how
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
that uh provision in the bill works and
 
02:08:30.549 --> 02:08:30.559 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my testimony um
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
and happy to take any questions thank
 
02:08:34.030 --> 02:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
you very much other questions from the
 
02:08:36.189 --> 02:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much Mr chairman
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:52.669 align:start position:0%
 
house

02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
okay good morning chairman live good to
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
see you again good morning um let's see
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify on Senate Bill
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
374 about certifying part-time teachers
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
and I'm here on behalf of our 3700
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
members across the state uh mostly in K
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
to through 12 public education we do
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill we oppose certifying uh
 
02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
we oppose hiring uncertified part-time
 
02:09:18.950 --> 02:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
teachers um we do understand there are
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
some content area experts that can be
 
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
used to bring into schools for um
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
specialized programs as guest speakers
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
things like that but um content area
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
expertise does not make one
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
um a teacher by itself that is not the
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
only that makes one suitable for the
 
02:09:42.390 --> 02:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
classroom um knowledge of a Content area
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
is important and it can be a great asset
 
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
in a student's learning experience uh to
 
02:09:50.350 --> 02:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
have contact with someone who has that
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
specialized knowledge but there's a lot
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
more to teaching than just knowing your
 
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
subject um you need to know about Child
 
02:09:59.149 --> 02:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
and Adolescent development uh how
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
Learners learn you need to know about
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
pedagogy and teaching methods how to
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
differentiate lessons for um different
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
sorts of Learners students with learning
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
challenges you need to know about
 
02:10:12.189 --> 02:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
classroom management engaging student
 
02:10:13.669 --> 02:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
attention and sustaining student
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
attention these are all part of the art
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
and craft of teaching and if someone has
 
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
not gone through a teaching program
 
02:10:22.669 --> 02:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
someone has not gotten
 
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
certification where are they going to
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
get that kind of knowledge that kind of
 
02:10:31.229 --> 02:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
skill and if you are
 
02:10:33.990 --> 02:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
not a certified teacher or if you are
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
not in one of these alternative
 
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
certification programs where you are
 
02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
working towards your certification and
 
02:10:42.549 --> 02:10:42.559 align:start position:0%
therefore at least taking some kind of
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
cohort or classes to gain that knowledge
 
02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
how are you going to do in front of
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
students I want to share a little story
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
with you and this goes back a few
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
decades when I was in high school our uh
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
geometry teacher had to be out uh for a
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
a planned absent he had you know surgery
 
02:11:02.109 --> 02:11:02.119 align:start position:0%
coming up they hired a uh sub for a
 
02:11:04.350 --> 02:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks who was a a lovely
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
retired gentleman from a defense
 
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
contractor he knew his subject he knew
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
math he was an engineer he used it in
 
02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.189 align:start position:0%
math he was an engineer he used it in
his

02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:12.199 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
career he didn't know anything about
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
teaching so he was very disappointed in
 
02:11:20.750 --> 02:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
us because we did not understand math
 
02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
the way he did he didn't understand how
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
to communicate with a bunch of high
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
school sophomores who didn't understand
 
02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
math and he got very frustrated with us
 
02:11:32.950 --> 02:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
when we just didn't get what he was
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
trying to explain and saying it over
 
02:11:41.629 --> 02:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
again slower and louder didn't help us
 
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
get the idea can you imagine what you're
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
setting students up for you can have the
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
best experts but if all they know how to
 
02:11:53.470 --> 02:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
do is say it's slower and louder and get
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
frustrated you're setting everyone up
 
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
for failure please find SB 374 in
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on behalf of all
 
02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
of our kids and some very frustrated
 
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
geometry students a couple decades ago
 
02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
02:12:12.750 --> 02:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee not see any thank
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.159 --> 02:12:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
Wilson

02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:30.189 --> 02:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh good morning House Education members
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
chairman lad thanks for hearing my
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
testimony today I'm Becky Wilson I am
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
the director of governmental relations
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire school boards
 
02:12:40.189 --> 02:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are opposed to this
 
02:12:43.549 --> 02:12:43.559 align:start position:0%
bill uh nsba does have a resolution
 
02:12:45.549 --> 02:12:45.559 align:start position:0%
which was put in place at our last uh
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
annual delegate assembly which seeks to
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
support actually legislation that
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
intends to streamline recruit
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
credentialing or hiring of certified uh
 
02:12:57.270 --> 02:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
Educators or other licensed School staff
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
from other states uh this resolution is
 
02:13:01.709 --> 02:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
in support of both the state of New
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire credentialing laws as well as
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
interstate compact and reciprocity
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
between New Hampshire and other states
 
02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
however this particular Bill does the
 
02:13:12.750 --> 02:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
opposite of meeting that resolution by
 
02:13:14.629 --> 02:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
potentially elevating the hiring of
 
02:13:17.790 --> 02:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
non-certified or non-licensed staff uh
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
30 hours I think a lot of the points
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about in a previous
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
bill in this committee as well as from
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
the previous people who testified today
 
02:13:28.030 --> 02:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
but 30 hours is significant if your
 
02:13:30.510 --> 02:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
school day is 8:30 to 2:30 that's 30
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
hours a week that's a full-time schedule
 
02:13:34.669 --> 02:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh even though this bill would say that
 
02:13:36.910 --> 02:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
that is a part-time schedule uh it's a
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
full teaching load you could see
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of kids in a week uh as a
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
non-certified staff or
 
02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
non-licensed uh I think it's already
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
been said districts have the ability to
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
hire non-certified people under a local
 
02:13:51.069 --> 02:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
critical shortage area that they can
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
identify in conjunction with the
 
02:13:54.589 --> 02:13:54.599 align:start position:0%
Department if they want to employ people
 
02:13:56.589 --> 02:13:56.599 align:start position:0%
longer than a year or two they can
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
become certified through an alternative
 
02:13:59.790 --> 02:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
program that is overseen by the
 
02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
department and the Local District um
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
they have three years to become
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
certified the difference with this bill
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
and that process is the expectation or
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
the motivation for that person who is
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
currently employed as an educator to
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
become certified at some point the way
 
02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
that this bill is written uh there's no
 
02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
expectation that the person would ever
 
02:14:22.709 --> 02:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
be certified even for you know five or
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
10 years um in addition I just want to
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
highlight that this committee and other
 
02:14:28.549 --> 02:14:28.559 align:start position:0%
committees have passed significant
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislation and other sessions um and
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
currently that require or have the
 
02:14:36.270 --> 02:14:36.280 align:start position:0%
expectation of Educators using specific
 
02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
types of pedagogy uh certain focus on
 
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
certain instructional strategies
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
classroom management positive supports
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
the ability to differentiate instruction
 
02:14:47.390 --> 02:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
to design formative and summative
 
02:14:49.149 --> 02:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
assessments and align them with State
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
Standards um this bill is making the
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
presumption that anybody who has some
 
02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
content knowledge if they even have that
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
is going to be able to Be an Effective
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
educator um and appropriately act as an
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
educator and meet all of the
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
expectations that have come out of this
 
02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislature um without any teacher prep
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
expectation ever um so I I share the
 
02:15:12.669 --> 02:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
concern about I'm not also sure what
 
02:15:14.430 --> 02:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
happens if they fall under the code of
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
conduct and they violate the code of
 
02:15:19.390 --> 02:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
conduct so what like what what happen
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
What Happens they go on a list um we
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
have a list of Educators that are um
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
have either surrendered their licenses
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
or are not able to be hired because
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
their licenses have been revoked I don't
 
02:15:32.069 --> 02:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
know what list this these particular
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
people would go on or what you're
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
revoking because that's just not um
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
spelled out in the bill happy to take
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative Cornell
 
02:15:43.229 --> 02:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
Thank you thank you for taking my
 
02:15:46.470 --> 02:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
question um it doesn't say in this bill
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
um what areas they could be hired in so
 
02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
one of the questions I have is somebody
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
could be hired to fill a special
 
02:15:55.709 --> 02:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
education position without any
 
02:15:58.390 --> 02:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
background in special education and no
 
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
idea of how to follow an IEP and that
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
would be for full 30 hours it's fulltime
 
02:16:05.229 --> 02:16:05.239 align:start position:0%
so am I reading that correctly do you
 
02:16:07.669 --> 02:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
think or thank you for the question um
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
yeah and there are some specific
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
programs and specific areas um that
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
would be considered I think critical
 
02:16:15.629 --> 02:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
shortage in lots of District special
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
education CTE um some of these other
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
really specified programs the problem is
 
02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
that I believe the federal laws for idea
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
for example would supersede this
 
02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
particular qualification so you would
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually still need to be certified um
 
02:16:32.230 --> 02:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure the person a could fill
 
02:16:35.309 --> 02:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
the position um you know with Fidelity
 
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
or B that it would meet the needs of the
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
school because the person can't do some
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
of the things that they would be
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
required to do under that position
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
further questions represent dry thank
 
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
you thanks for taking my question I I
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
just wanted to address the resolution
 
02:16:52.190 --> 02:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
you were talking about that is to
 
02:16:54.669 --> 02:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
streamline uh recruiting or hiring
 
02:16:57.669 --> 02:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
part-time full-time both Educators thank
 
02:16:59.070 --> 02:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
you for the question Educators that are
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
licensed in other states or where there
 
02:17:02.429 --> 02:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
could be reciprocity with other states
 
02:17:04.030 --> 02:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have that in New
 
02:17:05.910 --> 02:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that resolution is meant to
 
02:17:07.910 --> 02:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
try to increase the pool of people who
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
potentially were licensed in other
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
states for other POS similar positions
 
02:17:13.950 --> 02:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
that they could streamline the process
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
to become certified in New Hampshire
 
02:17:18.589 --> 02:17:18.599 align:start position:0%
okay well yes yeah they don't have this
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
similar problem of just lack of people
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
applying from things I'm just wondering
 
02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
where where they'd come from thank you
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
for the question they meaning other
 
02:17:29.469 --> 02:17:29.479 align:start position:0%
states don't have the say I think
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage Across the Nation is a
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
concern and I think that's what the
 
02:17:36.270 --> 02:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
focus of the study commission was on um
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
I think we still strongly believe as an
 
02:17:40.110 --> 02:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
association that Educators should be
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
licensed that that is that there for a
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
reason that teacher prep is important um
 
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
we're putting people in front of our
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable population we need
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
people who have had some sort of
 
02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
preparation to do that you're welcome
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:17:55.669 --> 02:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
02:17:58.349 --> 02:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
you I don't have any other pink cards in
 
02:18:01.389 --> 02:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
that but uh I see that uh Steve you're
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
here today uh we've heard the term
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and that's a term that's
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
often times confused thinking just
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's reciprocity we automatically
 
02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:14.519 align:start position:0%
accept something from another state I
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't believe that's the case could you
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
please explain good morning everyone
 
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Cher lad thank you
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve appy from the
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
director Department of Education um the
 
02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
term reciprocity is thrown around a lot
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
and the truth is Most states do not have
 
02:18:32.190 --> 02:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
true reciprocity which means I show you
 
02:18:34.830 --> 02:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
my license from another state and the
 
02:18:36.349 --> 02:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
receiving State just hands them a
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
license um what we do have is I I would
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
consider it partial reciprocity so that
 
02:18:44.750 --> 02:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
if someone holds a license from another
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
state and they come to our state we look
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
at the requirements they want they they
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
fulfilled to receive that license
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
and look at that versus our requirements
 
02:18:57.950 --> 02:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
and very often the only difference um is
 
02:19:00.349 --> 02:19:00.359 align:start position:0%
testing so for example our state
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
requires practice core testing to test
 
02:19:07.110 --> 02:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
basic academic skills or that um uh an
 
02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:08.429 align:start position:0%
basic academic skills or that um uh an
applicant

02:19:08.429 --> 02:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
applicant
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
substitute um instead of practice core
 
02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
they can substitute an SAT or another
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
standardized National exam uh and above
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
the 50th percen percentile and then
 
02:19:20.309 --> 02:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
we'll take that exam in place of um The
 
02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
Practice core so um while we don't have
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
true reciprocity most of the time we're
 
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
pretty close but that's that's the
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
difference and Most states do not have
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
true reciprocity they may say they do
 
02:19:34.629 --> 02:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
but in fact um they do similar to what
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
we do which is they have some state
 
02:19:37.870 --> 02:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
level requirements so for example
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
Georgia Georgia requires all Educators
 
02:19:42.910 --> 02:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
to take to to know Georgia history it's
 
02:19:45.870 --> 02:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
actually in their statute and um if you
 
02:19:47.309 --> 02:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
move from New Hampshire to Georgia with
 
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
an elementary ad license you may you
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
fulfill everything else but you need to
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
show them that you know Georgia history
 
02:19:56.550 --> 02:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
so that's the that's the the rub with
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
reciprocity so to speak your Hamshire
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
history doesn't cut it does
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
it reps Terry thank you so do I
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
understand um you saying that if a
 
02:20:12.190 --> 02:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
teacher were to come from another
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
state uh and there existed partial rep
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
reciprocity which as I'm thinking out
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
loud now there would be partial
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
reciprocity with respect to all the
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
other 49
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
states um does that mean that you
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate that person's license and if
 
02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
there is a difference that you consider
 
02:20:41.950 --> 02:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
to be a deficiency that that is what
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
would need to be made up but the other
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh areas where there is agreement
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
between the state
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
in which the person was licensed in New
 
02:20:55.870 --> 02:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you you could basically check
 
02:20:59.230 --> 02:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
that box off so that and in the final
 
02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
analysis only where there existed a
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
substantive difference that's what would
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
have to be made
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
up um and if that is the case how how
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
long would that person have to would
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
that person not be able to be uh
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
provisionally certified but would have
 
02:21:21.309 --> 02:21:21.319 align:start position:0%
to become certified in that
 
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
area where there is a difference or two
 
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
or three areas and then could be C
 
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
certified thank you y thank you for the
 
02:21:31.710 --> 02:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
question representative so um talking
 
02:21:34.349 --> 02:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
50,000 ft here not in specifics because
 
02:21:37.349 --> 02:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
there's an exception to every situation
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
um but generally speaking what you
 
02:21:42.790 --> 02:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
articulated is correct they would only
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
need to fulfill the missing requirement
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
for our state so if they came to us from
 
02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
Georgia with an elementary ad license
 
02:21:52.349 --> 02:21:52.359 align:start position:0%
and they had taken Elementary ED
 
02:21:56.190 --> 02:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
practice testing in Georgia they had um
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh had had a bachelor's degree or higher
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh and Georgia had accepted that they
 
02:22:03.230 --> 02:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
had taught under that license in Georgia
 
02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
and we have a we have a provision in our
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
rules around teaching or are practicing
 
02:22:10.630 --> 02:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
under the license in the role because
 
02:22:12.429 --> 02:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
some states uh give out emergency
 
02:22:15.389 --> 02:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
licenses to like we saw with Arizona
 
02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic to pretty much
 
02:22:18.550 --> 02:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
anybody that applied with no
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
requirements so we we have a few little
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
tweaks uh but but by and large yes they
 
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
would have to fulfill the missing piece
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
and in the interim um so conquered wants
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
to hire that individual that individual
 
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
is missing practice score testing they
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
have to take the test uh what can happen
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
is they can go on an intern
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
authorization and start teaching
 
02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
immediately and they have up to three
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
years on that intern
 
02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
authorization so they would have
 
02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
theoretically up to three years to
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
fulfill that requirement and then they
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
then they would eligible for full
 
02:22:53.230 --> 02:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
licensure on a beginning or experienced
 
02:22:54.670 --> 02:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
educator license depending what they had
 
02:22:57.630 --> 02:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
in their home state so thank you thank
 
02:22:59.070 --> 02:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh represent Miler
 
02:23:01.150 --> 02:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
and then represent whitcock oh thank you
 
02:23:03.150 --> 02:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you Mr applebe for being
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
here and we served on the teacher
 
02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
shortage committee so we're we're
 
02:23:09.150 --> 02:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with this so the question that
 
02:23:11.309 --> 02:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
I that I have for you though is that two
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
of the previous testifiers indicated the
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
emergency uh SE search that's currently
 
02:23:22.349 --> 02:23:22.359 align:start position:0%
available uh so why is this bill needed
 
02:23:25.670 --> 02:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
if in fact a school district can hire
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
somebody immediately and put them into
 
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
the Q as far as the process of getting
 
02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
the completing the total certification
 
02:23:35.710 --> 02:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
so why is this bill needed if that's
 
02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:37.070 align:start position:0%
so why is this bill needed if that's
already

02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:23:39.389 --> 02:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
available um thank you for the question
 
02:23:42.670 --> 02:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative I you know I I think one
 
02:23:44.190 --> 02:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
drawback to the current emergency
 
02:23:46.389 --> 02:23:46.399 align:start position:0%
authorization process which in statute
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
is the one-year Certificate of
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
Eligibility which last year was extended
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
to uh someone could renew get a second
 
02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
year but that's it so once once any
 
02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
individual in our state
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh receives their two years on a
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
one-year Certificate of Eligibility they
 
02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
can never get another one again
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
ever so if that individual had been on a
 
02:24:11.469 --> 02:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
one-year Certificate of Eligibility in
 
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
the past or even currently once they hit
 
02:24:16.790 --> 02:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
the end of that now 2-year period they
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
can never get a one-year Certificate of
 
02:24:21.309 --> 02:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
Eligibility again so there is no way
 
02:24:23.230 --> 02:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
past those two years for that individual
 
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
to continue on thank you representative
 
02:24:31.469 --> 02:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
Whit thank you chair Miss LV almost good
 
02:24:33.590 --> 02:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon yes thank you thank you for
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
here uh going back in your evaluation of
 
02:24:40.389 --> 02:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
applications for Staffing from other
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
states using the Georgia for example if
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
I may does your department look at if
 
02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
that person had teacher training
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
preparation uh yes uh they thank you for
 
02:24:56.110 --> 02:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
the question um yes um that is certainly
 
02:24:57.870 --> 02:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
a component of the evaluation however
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
they do not have to have that if they
 
02:25:02.429 --> 02:25:02.439 align:start position:0%
have worked in the role or under that
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
license for a period of time and I I'm
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
not saying how long because offand I
 
02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't remember how many years it is but
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
um but okay the the um completing An
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
approved educator preparation program in
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
another state with a recommendation to
 
02:25:20.429 --> 02:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
lure at times does come into play for
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
our license but at times it doesn't it
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
just depends oh thank you um so if I
 
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
just follow that uh I appli from Georgia
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
um I Never Had Any teacher training I
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
was the director of uh mathematics at a
 
02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:38.750 align:start position:0%
was the director of uh mathematics at a
private

02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
private
 
02:25:40.910 --> 02:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
institution I never taught I just
 
02:25:43.750 --> 02:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
administrator would I be certified under
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:51.710 --> 02:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
teacher uh thank you so um I I'm
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
hesitating only because there's usually
 
02:25:55.590 --> 02:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
a lot more to
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
this so if an individual worked in an
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
administr as an administrator in another
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction outside of New Hampshire
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
and they held the appropriate degree
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
level so not the content of the degree
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
but the degree level and they had um
 
02:26:15.389 --> 02:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
again it depending if this is a critical
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
shortage area or not the appropriate
 
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
number of classes in the subject area
 
02:26:22.110 --> 02:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
speaking just teachers so let's say it's
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
a math don't to make this confusing y I
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
was trying to Simply get to the teacher
 
02:26:27.830 --> 02:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
training part if I never taught if
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
you've never taught um if you've worked
 
02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
and again I forget the number of years
 
02:26:34.349 --> 02:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
but if you've worked under a license in
 
02:26:36.429 --> 02:26:36.439 align:start position:0%
the role even though you didn't complete
 
02:26:39.070 --> 02:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
a program we will count that thank you
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
even if you didn't go to a program thank
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
you repres ter you're welcome so with
 
02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
respect to the certificate of uh
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility are the standards uh and
 
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
criter IIA Andor criteria the same or
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
are they different with respect to um
 
02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
evaluating an applicant who um is
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
certified in another state so you're
 
02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
looking at reciprocity we we just talked
 
02:27:08.389 --> 02:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
you just talked with me about
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
reciprocity so what standards do you use
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
when uh determining whether someone can
 
02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
receive a Certificate of Eligibility
 
02:27:19.670 --> 02:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the person is in
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
state or coming from out of state uh for
 
02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
the first time are they are they similar
 
02:27:26.349 --> 02:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
or different uh thank you so if you're
 
02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
referring to the statute one your
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
certificant of Eligibility yes that
 
02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
statutory language outlines um a
 
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree unless it's a CTE
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
career and tech ed role and outlines
 
02:27:38.990 --> 02:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
they must pass a criminal history record
 
02:27:44.269 --> 02:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
check um and I believe those are the
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
criteria so I could I could look it up
 
02:27:48.269 --> 02:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
real quick if that would be helpful
 
02:27:50.990 --> 02:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
experience in the content area
 
02:27:52.429 --> 02:27:52.439 align:start position:0%
for a one-year Certificate of
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
Eligibility I believe it's the
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
superintendent or principal must deem
 
02:27:58.349 --> 02:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
them to be qualified I think it's the
 
02:28:01.469 --> 02:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
language something along those
 
02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
lines yes represent Tanner thank you and
 
02:28:07.150 --> 02:28:07.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I
 
02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to go back when you were talking
 
02:28:12.309 --> 02:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
about the need for this bill and that uh
 
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
if you applied for
 
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
emergency um as an emergency teacher
 
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
emergency availability
 
02:28:23.230 --> 02:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh that after we've extended it to two
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
years but after that they could
 
02:28:29.150 --> 02:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
never do anything again well is that
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
really correct because they during those
 
02:28:34.389 --> 02:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
first two years they could get into an
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
alternative program for
 
02:28:39.389 --> 02:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
certification um they
 
02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
could go to a teacher training school um
 
02:28:45.469 --> 02:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
and get certified so it isn't like
 
02:28:47.469 --> 02:28:47.479 align:start position:0%
you're in for two years and then on an
 
02:28:49.510 --> 02:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
emergency certificate and then that's it
 
02:28:51.510 --> 02:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
forever for your life I mean that's what
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
it sounded like that isn't really true
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
is it yes so I was speaking of if the
 
02:28:57.710 --> 02:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
individual many individuals thank you
 
02:29:00.670 --> 02:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative many individuals who um
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
pursue the one-year Certificate of
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
Eligibility aren't doing that and that's
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
what I was speaking to at the end of the
 
02:29:10.110 --> 02:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
two years if they haven't done anything
 
02:29:14.429 --> 02:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
else that's it yeah yes further
 
02:29:16.870 --> 02:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
questions yes representa Cornell Thank
 
02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question but
 
02:29:21.030 --> 02:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't require ire any kind
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
of credential from anywhere even another
 
02:29:27.550 --> 02:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
state it seems like it only requires a
 
02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
criminal history check it it doesn't
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
require a state board of education
 
02:29:36.710 --> 02:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
credential from anywhere in the country
 
02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
or any kind of background in the subject
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
it just says a criminal history
 
02:29:46.269 --> 02:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
check thank you you're reading that
 
02:29:49.030 --> 02:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
correctly yes okay thank you further
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions n thank you very much and we
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
have no further pin cards on this so
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to close this hearing and

okay we're going to go ahead and start
 
03:36:56.309 --> 03:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
here um for the Senate Bill 378 this is
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
relative to the performance-based school
 
03:37:01.710 --> 03:37:01.720 align:start position:0%
accountability system task force uh
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
before I invite Senator Ward up um these
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
these books which you received here this
 
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
is the LBA report uh audit report on due
 
03:37:15.030 --> 03:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
process which we will be having a uh uh
 
03:37:17.070 --> 03:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
a present presentation to this committee
 
03:37:21.429 --> 03:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
on April the 3D at 10:00 in the morning
 
03:37:23.990 --> 03:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that's April 3 you might put that it'
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
be coming out in the
 
03:37:30.189 --> 03:37:30.199 align:start position:0%
calendar so Senator Ward you're welcome
 
03:37:33.830 --> 03:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
to come up and present 378 this is a
 
03:37:35.429 --> 03:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
performance Bas School accountability
 
03:37:38.790 --> 03:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
system thank you very much TK force and
 
03:37:44.429 --> 03:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:44.439 --> 03:37:48.070 align:start position:0%
 
bill

03:37:48.070 --> 03:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
so I am Ruth Ward from District 8 and
 
03:37:56.269 --> 03:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce s SP 378 it's a
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:02.950 --> 03:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
Education the department is trying to
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
implement State accountability through
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
the measurement of for the adequate
 
03:38:12.070 --> 03:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
education as required in RSA
 
03:38:14.830 --> 03:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
193e through this implementation there
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
has been CR ISM of the existing process
 
03:38:20.309 --> 03:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
that is in law and whether it reflects
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
the definition of an adequate
 
03:38:25.189 --> 03:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
education the department believes that
 
03:38:27.550 --> 03:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
the pbass measurement should
 
03:38:29.349 --> 03:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
continuously be
 
03:38:32.349 --> 03:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
improved the department is reenacting a
 
03:38:35.309 --> 03:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
task force previously in law that
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
consists of practitioners and will work
 
03:38:40.389 --> 03:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
under the advisement of the legislature
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the pbas measure reflects
 
03:38:46.429 --> 03:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
the definition of an adequate education
 
03:38:48.429 --> 03:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
as well as a process that can be
 
03:38:50.670 --> 03:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
implemented by the department in New
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public
 
03:38:55.150 --> 03:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
Schools I know the department is here to
 
03:38:57.830 --> 03:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
testify so I would
 
03:39:00.189 --> 03:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
respectfully have any questions that you
 
03:39:03.590 --> 03:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
would like to have defer to them I think
 
03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
they would do a much better job than I
 
03:39:08.429 --> 03:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
could word very
 
03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
tactful are there any questions of
 
03:39:10.479 --> 03:39:12.750 align:start position:0%
tactful are there any questions of
Senator

03:39:12.750 --> 03:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
Ward you got your wish
 
03:39:17.469 --> 03:39:17.479 align:start position:0%
you're off the
 
03:39:23.309 --> 03:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:27.309 --> 03:39:27.319 align:start position:0%
request so Kate and Nate get
 
03:39:27.319 --> 03:39:31.429 align:start position:0%
request so Kate and Nate get
it

03:39:31.429 --> 03:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.950 --> 03:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
okay Kate Nate yeah don't forget your
 
03:39:37.910 --> 03:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
pink cards too we've been called and did
 
03:39:41.950 --> 03:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.269 --> 03:39:46.279 align:start position:0%
cart we'll fill one out for okay
 
03:39:49.269 --> 03:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
okay welcome hello good afternoon
 
03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn Davis from the Department of
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
Education and Nate K also from the
 
03:39:55.950 --> 03:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um so you may
 
03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
remember about a year ago and we sat
 
03:40:00.429 --> 03:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
behind or at this table in front of you
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
guys and went through SB 266 at length
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
for many many hours and we couldn't come
 
03:40:10.150 --> 03:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
to a conclusion about that bill um and
 
03:40:12.349 --> 03:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
that bill was an overhaul of all of the
 
03:40:15.150 --> 03:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
state accountability laws um and we were
 
03:40:17.309 --> 03:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
at that time that bill was really to
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
clear up what we felt were technical
 
03:40:21.269 --> 03:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
issues with the implementation of
 
03:40:23.710 --> 03:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
accountability but a lot of the concerns
 
03:40:26.189 --> 03:40:26.199 align:start position:0%
from this committee were not necessarily
 
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the technical concerns of
 
03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
implementation of accountability but
 
03:40:34.590 --> 03:40:34.600 align:start position:0%
were more around the actual um pieces of
 
03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
what the department was doing so we if
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
you remember there was a lot of
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
conversations around um things like
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and um just other data
 
03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
points that are currently in the pbass
 
03:40:49.870 --> 03:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
um calculation so in response to that
 
03:40:51.229 --> 03:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
because partially because we were not
 
03:40:53.070 --> 03:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
able to get that full comprehensive bill
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
pass in the what we wanted to um we kind
 
03:40:57.870 --> 03:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
of took it under advisement and the
 
03:40:59.070 --> 03:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that were brought to us in the
 
03:41:00.990 --> 03:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
committee and said we agree this it's
 
03:41:02.670 --> 03:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
actually time that the department does
 
03:41:04.830 --> 03:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
do some work relative to the pbass
 
03:41:07.750 --> 03:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
system and we should look at it um prior
 
03:41:11.950 --> 03:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
to 2019 this task force was in law um or
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
very similar task force was in law and
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
it did look at the p calculation and so
 
03:41:18.670 --> 03:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
we we really would like to do is just
 
03:41:20.349 --> 03:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
bring it back start talking about the
 
03:41:22.349 --> 03:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
pbas calculation again start looking at
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
some of those metrics seeing if they're
 
03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
correct for New Hampshire um in
 
03:41:27.990 --> 03:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
consultation with practitioners and then
 
03:41:29.830 --> 03:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
bring the proposal to the legislature to
 
03:41:32.269 --> 03:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
then start implementing the pbass side
 
03:41:34.750 --> 03:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
of things so just remember um just for
 
03:41:37.630 --> 03:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
your memory so the um adequate education
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
has two judgments essentially so we have
 
03:41:42.070 --> 03:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
the input input based accountability
 
03:41:44.429 --> 03:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
system which is called ibass and pbass
 
03:41:45.550 --> 03:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
which is the performance Bas
 
03:41:47.710 --> 03:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
accountability system and the prath
 
03:41:49.229 --> 03:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
system takes a variety of school
 
03:41:51.030 --> 03:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
district data and the department does
 
03:41:52.630 --> 03:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
calculations and then determines if a
 
03:41:54.429 --> 03:41:54.439 align:start position:0%
school district is providing an adequate
 
03:41:56.510 --> 03:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
education or not um through those
 
03:41:58.429 --> 03:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
metrics and so that's what this task
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
force would do it would go look at those
 
03:42:01.349 --> 03:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
measurements and decide if the
 
03:42:03.750 --> 03:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
measurements are appropriate um and
 
03:42:05.110 --> 03:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative of what New Hampshire
 
03:42:08.189 --> 03:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
schools um are required to do um in
 
03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
accordance with RSA
 
03:42:12.149 --> 03:42:12.159 align:start position:0%
193e and then we would we would
 
03:42:14.070 --> 03:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
Implement that so that's really what
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
that this proposal is doing is bringing
 
03:42:18.429 --> 03:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
back back that to task force um I do
 
03:42:20.469 --> 03:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
also want to point out that um the
 
03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
department has Federal accountability
 
03:42:24.309 --> 03:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
requirements some of it is aligned to
 
03:42:25.550 --> 03:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
this but that I think is some of the
 
03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
challenge that we talked about with 266
 
03:42:29.870 --> 03:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
as well is that we have Federal
 
03:42:31.149 --> 03:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
accountability and maybe State
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
accountability should be a little
 
03:42:34.870 --> 03:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
different so we do have an advisory task
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
force right now for the federal
 
03:42:39.070 --> 03:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
accountability task force um and sorry
 
03:42:40.990 --> 03:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
the federal accountability system and so
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
we would just have a separate task force
 
03:42:44.149 --> 03:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
that would look specifically at State
 
03:42:45.670 --> 03:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
accountability and we feel that those
 
03:42:47.830 --> 03:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
would kind of work nicely to make sure
 
03:42:50.349 --> 03:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
that the metrics are um appropriate and
 
03:42:50.359 --> 03:42:54.269 align:start position:0%
that the metrics are um appropriate and
implementable

03:42:54.269 --> 03:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
so are there any questions for the
 
03:42:58.950 --> 03:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
Department represent
 
03:43:02.269 --> 03:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
leus yes there's one thing that I would
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
love to see in this that I'm not sure is
 
03:43:07.950 --> 03:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
implementable so I want to know what you
 
03:43:09.750 --> 03:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
think and if this is something that
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
could actually be done and that's uh the
 
03:43:16.189 --> 03:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
percentage of students who go on to
 
03:43:19.630 --> 03:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education who need
 
03:43:23.269 --> 03:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
remediation because they're not really
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't really have you know haven't
 
03:43:26.670 --> 03:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
gotten what they needed to go to college
 
03:43:28.469 --> 03:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
if they need remediation when they get
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
there and we keep hearing from the
 
03:43:34.110 --> 03:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
colleges how many students they're
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
having to remediate and so I'm wondering
 
03:43:39.630 --> 03:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
is is that something that could even be
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
done so we don't have that data right
 
03:43:43.030 --> 03:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
now at the Department of Education but
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
we could certainly think through how
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
that could happen um this bill
 
03:43:48.309 --> 03:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
definitely leaves room for something
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
like that to be part of the pbass system
 
03:43:53.149 --> 03:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
because right now so the system the um
 
03:43:55.349 --> 03:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
on page two of the bill you have a
 
03:43:56.630 --> 03:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
couple different areas right now which
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
are in the current pbass system but it
 
03:44:01.149 --> 03:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
says the task force may consider one or
 
03:44:03.790 --> 03:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
more of the following data um and
 
03:44:05.750 --> 03:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
indicators and so there's no reason why
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
the task force certainly couldn't add
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
that um we do want to make sure that
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's something that we have data for and
 
03:44:14.510 --> 03:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I I wouldn't um know off the top of
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
my head um what you know how that system
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
would work with the various College
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
systems but we could certainly have
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
those conversations thank you represent
 
03:44:26.910 --> 03:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:44:28.710 --> 03:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
for being here to answer this question
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
um there's a specific phrase I'm looking
 
03:44:34.750 --> 03:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
at here it says uh after the task force
 
03:44:36.389 --> 03:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
will deploy a performance-based scoring
 
03:44:38.189 --> 03:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
system in the next sentence it says
 
03:44:40.590 --> 03:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
using only the best available
 
03:44:42.910 --> 03:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
accountability system that sounds like a
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
very specific thing but it's something
 
03:44:45.790 --> 03:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with can you can you
 
03:44:47.550 --> 03:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
tell me what what that is the best
 
03:44:49.469 --> 03:44:49.479 align:start position:0%
available accountability system um what
 
03:44:52.269 --> 03:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
line are you looking on uh I'm on the
 
03:45:02.189 --> 03:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:04.590 --> 03:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
oh I mean my assumption is that that
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
it's actually a real thing and already
 
03:45:09.149 --> 03:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
exist I would think so I I don't know we
 
03:45:12.070 --> 03:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
have any I have I have a a guess as to
 
03:45:13.910 --> 03:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
because the task force existed
 
03:45:15.910 --> 03:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
previously in law my guess is it
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
probably came from the change over when
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
we were moving from No Child Left Behind
 
03:45:22.189 --> 03:45:22.199 align:start position:0%
to the every student succeeds act when
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
every state in the country was looking
 
03:45:25.990 --> 03:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
at developing a new accountability
 
03:45:27.630 --> 03:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
system so that may have been language
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
that was pulled from the old
 
03:45:30.630 --> 03:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
accountability task force language that
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
said we would look at a variety of what
 
03:45:33.149 --> 03:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
other states were doing and pull from
 
03:45:35.670 --> 03:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
the best accountability systems um you
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
know looking at things like
 
03:45:39.030 --> 03:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
research-based designs that's my guess
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we necessarily
 
03:45:42.269 --> 03:45:42.279 align:start position:0%
intentionally put in here where we had a
 
03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.550 --> 03:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
further qu represent
 
03:45:52.469 --> 03:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
Cornell Thank you thank you Kon Nate
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
um lines 16 through 18 I it's other
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
people who will be on the uh commission
 
03:46:01.670 --> 03:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I just don't know who you might mean
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
by educational experts parents or
 
03:46:06.189 --> 03:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
Guardians and members of a public
 
03:46:09.030 --> 03:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
interest group or individuals with
 
03:46:10.670 --> 03:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
information or expertise do you have any
 
03:46:13.710 --> 03:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
ideas who that might be or um so I mean
 
03:46:15.149 --> 03:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
the the ones that we can obviously think
 
03:46:16.750 --> 03:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
about are the typical people that are in
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
this room today that um
 
03:46:21.030 --> 03:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
usually attend a lot of these hearings
 
03:46:22.110 --> 03:46:22.120 align:start position:0%
and provide their oversight we're
 
03:46:24.750 --> 03:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
talking you know nhsaa the school boards
 
03:46:27.790 --> 03:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
Association and other um organizations
 
03:46:29.950 --> 03:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
like that that generally participate in
 
03:46:31.469 --> 03:46:31.479 align:start position:0%
these types of things we didn't want to
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
name them specifically in the bill
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
specific if they didn't want to
 
03:46:36.149 --> 03:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
participate we don't want to force them
 
03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
to do that but we want to make sure that
 
03:46:39.630 --> 03:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to kind of have some
 
03:46:41.950 --> 03:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
wide Outreach um and so that's kind of
 
03:46:43.870 --> 03:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
what that other catchall kind of phrase
 
03:46:49.030 --> 03:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
is okay and follow and another one um
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
line8 the commissioner in consultation
 
03:46:54.189 --> 03:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
with the legislative oversight committee
 
03:46:56.590 --> 03:46:56.600 align:start position:0%
will that they really will consult with
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee it
 
03:47:02.389 --> 03:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
requires that okay all right thank you
 
03:47:06.630 --> 03:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner your thank you um
 
03:47:10.469 --> 03:47:10.479 align:start position:0%
in response to uh representative L's uh
 
03:47:13.870 --> 03:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
request um one of the things that I
 
03:47:16.189 --> 03:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
think needs to be kind of parsed out on
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
that is that for example a young student
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
a student that graduates from high
 
03:47:24.510 --> 03:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
school who suddenly decides they want to
 
03:47:26.590 --> 03:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
go into engineering or nursing or
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
something like that that has a special
 
03:47:31.349 --> 03:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
requirement that they didn't take in
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
high school maybe an advanced math
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
course or an advanced science course um
 
03:47:39.630 --> 03:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
that that not be considered
 
03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
remediation that that there be a
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
different category for that is that
 
03:47:46.269 --> 03:47:46.279 align:start position:0%
possible again I don't know enough about
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
that kind of data set and how that's
 
03:47:49.510 --> 03:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
collected and everything like that to do
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
that um that would be probably much
 
03:47:54.389 --> 03:47:54.399 align:start position:0%
further into the future I think we first
 
03:47:55.750 --> 03:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
need to figure out what those indicators
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
are and when we have those conversations
 
03:48:00.189 --> 03:48:00.199 align:start position:0%
that can be brought up um but we're
 
03:48:01.670 --> 03:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're very far away from even
 
03:48:02.990 --> 03:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
determining what the potential
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
indicators are right now and can I have
 
03:48:07.630 --> 03:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
a follow up on this yes so um it's not
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's actually separate question so you
 
03:48:12.189 --> 03:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
have a task force going on right now is
 
03:48:14.349 --> 03:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
the Task Force that's going on right now
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
for the Federal um does it pretty much
 
03:48:20.349 --> 03:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
mirror the consistency of this task
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
force that that you've outlined in the
 
03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
program the existing task force is
 
03:48:25.149 --> 03:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
primar primarily made up of
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent and principles from the
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
state um so this one is a little bit
 
03:48:30.790 --> 03:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
more wide reaching but this is more
 
03:48:32.149 --> 03:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific so we wanted to
 
03:48:34.750 --> 03:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
include a wider variety of of
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
individuals thank you represent Terry
 
03:48:40.990 --> 03:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
thanks I would just like to follow on uh
 
03:48:42.670 --> 03:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
and drill down a little further on the
 
03:48:44.750 --> 03:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
question that was posed To You by r
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
resentative Belzer with respect to the
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
the language um on lines 29 and
 
03:48:55.269 --> 03:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
30 uh using only the best available
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
accountability system so does it already
 
03:49:01.269 --> 03:49:01.279 align:start position:0%
has it already been determined what the
 
03:49:04.229 --> 03:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
best available accountability system is
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
and if so who decided on what basis and
 
03:49:09.309 --> 03:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't no decision has yet been
 
03:49:13.750 --> 03:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
made who will decide on what um and and
 
03:49:16.830 --> 03:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
on what basis will the decision be made
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
so there are a variety of different ways
 
03:49:20.229 --> 03:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
of looking at an accountability system I
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
think this one specifically where it
 
03:49:23.950 --> 03:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
goes on to say which shall be based on
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
data and indicators that's referring to
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
the idea that the best accountability
 
03:49:30.750 --> 03:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
system available is one that is based
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
off of objective data that the
 
03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
department has and indicators as opposed
 
03:49:35.790 --> 03:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
to something that might be more
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
subjective or qualitative um it's very
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to create an accountability
 
03:49:42.070 --> 03:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
system based off of more qualitative
 
03:49:43.229 --> 03:49:43.239 align:start position:0%
measures even though we know that's a
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
big part of measuring educ
 
03:49:47.189 --> 03:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
so when we're building an accountability
 
03:49:48.510 --> 03:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
system we have to make sure that one
 
03:49:50.950 --> 03:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's data that the department can get
 
03:49:52.910 --> 03:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
and two that even if the department can
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
get the data is what is the cost benefit
 
03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
to that so I know there a couple of
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
questions around Higher Education data
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of Higher Education data
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
out there it's not always available to
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education sometimes
 
03:50:06.110 --> 03:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
highed data comes at a cost because
 
03:50:07.389 --> 03:50:07.399 align:start position:0%
you're purchasing it from private
 
03:50:08.830 --> 03:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
universities and colleges through
 
03:50:10.950 --> 03:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
systems where they're aggregating data
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
so part of it is making sure that we're
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
building the best accountability system
 
03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
available to us using data and
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
indicators that we can get at the
 
03:50:22.110 --> 03:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
department yes so uh just so that I'm
 
03:50:24.510 --> 03:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
sure that I understand uh this does not
 
03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
yet this does not already exist this is
 
03:50:30.030 --> 03:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
something that would be de developed
 
03:50:31.950 --> 03:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
it'll be it'll be a new exercise and a
 
03:50:34.469 --> 03:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
new process as per the descriptive
 
03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
language here so the current
 
03:50:37.750 --> 03:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
accountability system is the
 
03:50:39.830 --> 03:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
03:50:41.469 --> 03:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
that's modeled after the federal
 
03:50:42.910 --> 03:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
accountability system so right now that
 
03:50:45.030 --> 03:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
system is doing double duty it's serving
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
as both a federal and a state
 
03:50:49.030 --> 03:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
accountability system the intent of this
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
bill through the task force would be to
 
03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
look at whether that single system can
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
truly represent both federal and state
 
03:50:57.990 --> 03:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
accountability and if there are
 
03:50:59.870 --> 03:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
additional measures needed that we
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
create a separate State accountability
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
process that would be new okay thanks
 
03:51:05.399 --> 03:51:06.510 align:start position:0%
process that would be new okay thanks
repr

03:51:06.510 --> 03:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
repr
 
03:51:09.229 --> 03:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and I I just I
 
03:51:10.510 --> 03:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
need to drill a little bit further down
 
03:51:12.229 --> 03:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
on that same issue and it's only because
 
03:51:13.870 --> 03:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
of the way this is this is worded to see
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
if maybe we need to make a change to
 
03:51:17.830 --> 03:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
this to fix it because the way I read it
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
given the particular placement of these
 
03:51:23.389 --> 03:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
two um uh commas is that there's two
 
03:51:24.710 --> 03:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
different systems here first of all
 
03:51:26.030 --> 03:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's the performance- based scoring
 
03:51:27.950 --> 03:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
system and then there's the
 
03:51:30.990 --> 03:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
accountability system uh and you can
 
03:51:33.149 --> 03:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
remove that that accountability system
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
part between these two uh commas and
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
read it the same way which is just the
 
03:51:40.710 --> 03:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
task force she'll develop for a
 
03:51:42.710 --> 03:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
performance-based scoring system which
 
03:51:44.550 --> 03:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
will be based on data and indicators
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
which are already available
 
03:51:49.710 --> 03:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
um so it looks like to me just the way
 
03:51:51.870 --> 03:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
that this is phrased is there is a
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
separate accountability system which
 
03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
stands alone from the scoring system
 
03:51:57.030 --> 03:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
which is not something they're
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
developing they're only developing a
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
performance-based scoring system I yes I
 
03:52:04.030 --> 03:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
see yeah that makes sense thank you okay
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
thank um I from an implementation
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
perspective in terms of what we're
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish at the department I
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
you could strike that language in
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
between those commas it's not going to
 
03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
change um what we're trying to implement
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
at the department
 
03:52:17.830 --> 03:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's a single system essentially
 
03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
yep yes Bon Damon thank you Mr chair
 
03:52:24.389 --> 03:52:24.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for helping us understand this
 
03:52:28.389 --> 03:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
could you give us some more perspective
 
03:52:31.469 --> 03:52:31.479 align:start position:0%
on the differences between Federal
 
03:52:33.229 --> 03:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
accountability and state accountability
 
03:52:36.590 --> 03:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
and why the existing task force wouldn't
 
03:52:38.950 --> 03:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
be adequate or take on what's in this
 
03:52:38.960 --> 03:52:40.469 align:start position:0%
be adequate or take on what's in this
proposed

03:52:40.469 --> 03:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:52:42.429 --> 03:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
legislation so the federal
 
03:52:43.870 --> 03:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
accountability system is based off of
 
03:52:45.750 --> 03:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
what's in the state as a plan and it's
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
required to follow um pretty
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
prescriptive federal guidelines there
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
are times where statutes have been
 
03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
changed over the past few years to add
 
03:52:56.269 --> 03:52:56.279 align:start position:0%
additional metrics in that we would want
 
03:52:58.750 --> 03:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
to measure school's performance on
 
03:53:00.990 --> 03:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
relative to inadequate education um I'm
 
03:53:02.990 --> 03:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about the Civics legislation
 
03:53:04.870 --> 03:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
that added the citizenship test as a
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement uh much of that
 
03:53:09.550 --> 03:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
language tied in with some of the social
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
study standards that are part of the
 
03:53:12.950 --> 03:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
provision of an adequate education in
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
193e but those are very New Hampshire
 
03:53:17.110 --> 03:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
specific and not part of the federal
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
accountability system so a state
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
accountability system may want to take
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
into account measures around social
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
studies and Civics education because
 
03:53:27.189 --> 03:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
that is more part of our state system
 
03:53:28.750 --> 03:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
but is not reflected in the federal
 
03:53:31.189 --> 03:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
system um similarly Caitlyn mentioned
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
graduation rates the federal requirement
 
03:53:35.710 --> 03:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
is um schools are held accountable if
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
they have a graduation rate below
 
03:53:40.469 --> 03:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
67% we don't have an ability to change
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
that because that 67% figure is a
 
03:53:45.030 --> 03:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
federal requirement we might as New
 
03:53:47.149 --> 03:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who has a a very high
 
03:53:50.110 --> 03:53:50.120 align:start position:0%
Statewide graduation rate of 92 93% may
 
03:53:51.950 --> 03:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
want to set a higher bar for the state
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
accountability system we can't do that
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
within the federal system because we
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
have to keep that 67% number so I think
 
03:54:00.510 --> 03:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
there are times where it is beneficial
 
03:54:03.309 --> 03:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
for us as a state to look at what is
 
03:54:06.030 --> 03:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
more reflective of New Hampshire schools
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
that allows us to create an
 
03:54:08.870 --> 03:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
accountability system outside of the
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
prescriptive nature of the federal
 
03:54:16.630 --> 03:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
system yes that's very helpful so would
 
03:54:19.990 --> 03:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
it be correct to say that what you're
 
03:54:21.790 --> 03:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
asking for here would be a more
 
03:54:24.389 --> 03:54:24.399 align:start position:0%
comprehensive accountability and
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
specific to do Hampshire standards than
 
03:54:27.670 --> 03:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
what is currently happening for the
 
03:54:31.070 --> 03:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
federal accountability yes I think what
 
03:54:32.590 --> 03:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
has happened in the past is because we
 
03:54:34.389 --> 03:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
were required to create a federal
 
03:54:36.189 --> 03:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
accountability system in order to
 
03:54:39.229 --> 03:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
receive title funding um in an effort to
 
03:54:41.309 --> 03:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
conserve resources to conserve Personnel
 
03:54:43.149 --> 03:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
of the department because we had to
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
create this federal system we then used
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
it to also serve as our state
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
accountability when measuring the
 
03:54:52.429 --> 03:54:52.439 align:start position:0%
provision of an adequate education um
 
03:54:53.630 --> 03:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
but I think that there's been so much
 
03:54:55.269 --> 03:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
over the past few years since that
 
03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
decision was made you know when we moved
 
03:54:59.830 --> 03:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
from noad Left Behind to Essa that it
 
03:55:01.710 --> 03:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
seems like there is more of a need now
 
03:55:03.630 --> 03:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
for State accountability that is
 
03:55:05.510 --> 03:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
separate and different from what's
 
03:55:07.469 --> 03:55:07.479 align:start position:0%
required under the federal
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
system I have a question here on page
 
03:55:15.550 --> 03:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
two right at the top on line two
 
03:55:17.070 --> 03:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
where you're saying that the task force
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
may consider one or more of the
 
03:55:18.960 --> 03:55:20.990 align:start position:0%
may consider one or more of the
following

03:55:20.990 --> 03:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
following
 
03:55:24.070 --> 03:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
indicators and course we've already had
 
03:55:25.710 --> 03:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters in here this morning
 
03:55:28.349 --> 03:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
talking about Career Technical education
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a number of us on this
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
committee that are very concerned
 
03:55:35.110 --> 03:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
with when compared to other states the
 
03:55:37.309 --> 03:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
weak performance the state has in terms
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the percentage and number of
 
03:55:44.670 --> 03:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
kids leaving high school with a indust
 
03:55:48.550 --> 03:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
industry recognized certificate of some
 
03:55:52.590 --> 03:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
kind um and it's primarily due to
 
03:55:54.790 --> 03:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's no more seats available in some
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
of the CTE centers to allow these
 
03:55:59.910 --> 03:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
students to participate we heard this
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
morning that conquered High had you know
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
100 applications with 40 seats um so why
 
03:56:12.670 --> 03:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
have you why is this missing that Career
 
03:56:14.269 --> 03:56:14.279 align:start position:0%
and Technical education industry right
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
recognize credential as a criteria or a
 
03:56:20.750 --> 03:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
indicator that we're doing what we
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
should be doing when in fact that's
 
03:56:26.469 --> 03:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
already in law um so it's not here so
 
03:56:28.910 --> 03:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
right now um their a career Readiness
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
indicator is actually sorry a um a what
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
is it ument career ready yeah what is
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
what is the term what is the one that we
 
03:56:39.389 --> 03:56:39.399 align:start position:0%
actually use it's in there is a post the
 
03:56:41.870 --> 03:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
credential um there's a a couple there
 
03:56:43.229 --> 03:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
so students that participate in
 
03:56:46.070 --> 03:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships um uh job based learning
 
03:56:48.670 --> 03:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
students that receive a career a career
 
03:56:50.269 --> 03:56:50.279 align:start position:0%
recognized or industry recognized
 
03:56:52.149 --> 03:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
credential is one of the indicators so
 
03:56:53.469 --> 03:56:53.479 align:start position:0%
that is already one of the indicators
 
03:56:55.389 --> 03:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
that's covered under C right now um
 
03:56:57.030 --> 03:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the federal account the
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
federal accountability plan um but
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's what you're asking right now and
 
03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
what representative lakas is asking um
 
03:57:05.349 --> 03:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
is that's why we have a May right now
 
03:57:06.830 --> 03:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
because we want to have this
 
03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
conversation and say what else should be
 
03:57:10.670 --> 03:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
measured and is not currently be
 
03:57:12.269 --> 03:57:12.279 align:start position:0%
measured and then bring a proposal
 
03:57:14.309 --> 03:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
forward to the legislature and say this
 
03:57:16.110 --> 03:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
is what we think the new accountability
 
03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
system should be um let's put this in
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
law and now let's start implementing
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
this new accountability system because I
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
think we can have robust account I bet
 
03:57:25.110 --> 03:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
you know if we went around to every
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
single one of you you each would
 
03:57:28.269 --> 03:57:28.279 align:start position:0%
probably something different for that
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
you would think that should be in the
 
03:57:30.750 --> 03:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
accountability system and we need to
 
03:57:32.950 --> 03:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
start kind of having those conversations
 
03:57:34.830 --> 03:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
documenting them and kind of getting
 
03:57:36.309 --> 03:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
something together as a plan that we can
 
03:57:36.319 --> 03:57:37.670 align:start position:0%
something together as a plan that we can
start

03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
start
 
03:57:39.830 --> 03:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
implementing well I'll follow that up
 
03:57:41.630 --> 03:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
because on line
 
03:57:43.830 --> 03:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
four it says number and percentage of
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
gradu ating people's going on to
 
03:57:46.990 --> 03:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education and military
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
service MH I'd like to know a number of
 
03:57:50.910 --> 03:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
kids going on with an industry
 
03:57:52.590 --> 03:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
recognized skill that are going right
 
03:57:57.110 --> 03:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
into career and job and so why is that
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
then which we the the legislature's
 
03:58:03.750 --> 03:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
already provided that by way of Statute
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
we said yes we want this information why
 
03:58:08.469 --> 03:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
not put it in as one of the areas to be
 
03:58:10.510 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
considered in this task by this task
 
03:58:12.149 --> 03:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
force I mean we certainly could I mean
 
03:58:13.710 --> 03:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
the task force can consider it on its
 
03:58:16.189 --> 03:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
own though too I mean I see this task
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
force potentially you know having a
 
03:58:19.630 --> 03:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
conversation with most of the people in
 
03:58:21.189 --> 03:58:21.199 align:start position:0%
this room and saying you know what
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
should we be doing where should the
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
direction do you have suggestions on
 
03:58:27.110 --> 03:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
this I see them taking stakeholder input
 
03:58:30.670 --> 03:58:30.680 align:start position:0%
and whatnot um so um that's a a great
 
03:58:32.630 --> 03:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
area for this task force to do relative
 
03:58:34.149 --> 03:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
to that specific metric that you're
 
03:58:35.710 --> 03:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
talking about there I'm not sure how the
 
03:58:36.750 --> 03:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
department would collect that
 
03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
information because we don't have
 
03:58:39.429 --> 03:58:39.439 align:start position:0%
information we don't have Labor
 
03:58:41.550 --> 03:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
information um so that one would be
 
03:58:43.269 --> 03:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
specifically challenging and I don't
 
03:58:45.510 --> 03:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
know how we would do that match that
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
matchup but that's not conversations we
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
can't have I don't want to be
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
argumentative but wouldn't this be what
 
03:58:57.189 --> 03:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
we want from this is that we want these
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
indicators and if you don't have the the
 
03:59:01.670 --> 03:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
process or the way to get this
 
03:59:03.149 --> 03:59:03.159 align:start position:0%
information now shouldn't that be
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
something that this task force is
 
03:59:09.269 --> 03:59:09.279 align:start position:0%
suggesting we work towards um would you
 
03:59:13.030 --> 03:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
be objecting to this being amended to
 
03:59:16.349 --> 03:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
include not at all okay thank
 
03:59:19.630 --> 03:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
you and I would say too so letter H we
 
03:59:21.229 --> 03:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
have in here as a catchall that says
 
03:59:24.269 --> 03:59:24.279 align:start position:0%
other Mets I know I see but I don't like
 
03:59:27.269 --> 03:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
I don't like CTE being an H I like it
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
being its own exactly I think there are
 
03:59:30.349 --> 03:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
things that you know both Caitlyn and I
 
03:59:31.710 --> 03:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
recognize there are things that we're
 
03:59:33.269 --> 03:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
not even going to be thinking of at the
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
department that that's why we need to
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
bring in external stakeholders to say
 
03:59:38.710 --> 03:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
what is it that should be included into
 
03:59:40.269 --> 03:59:40.279 align:start position:0%
this system because we could come up
 
03:59:41.790 --> 03:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
with our list of indicators and it may
 
03:59:43.429 --> 03:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
not be the same as every other person
 
03:59:44.750 --> 03:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
that we ask
 
03:59:46.750 --> 03:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want laundry list but you
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
know represent
 
03:59:52.510 --> 03:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you uh so does this task
 
03:59:55.870 --> 03:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
force also set the level for
 
03:59:58.790 --> 03:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
proficiency like you talked about the
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
graduation uh rate and is that one of
 
04:00:04.149 --> 04:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
their tasks as well will they be setting
 
04:00:04.159 --> 04:00:05.590 align:start position:0%
their tasks as well will they be setting
the

04:00:05.590 --> 04:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:07.990 --> 04:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
levels yeah so in any kind of system you
 
04:00:11.830 --> 04:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
would have to set um what is considered
 
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh performance and then what is
 
04:00:15.189 --> 04:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
considered meeting an adequate education
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
specific to a state accountability
 
04:00:20.309 --> 04:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
system it's really a it's a either or
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
either a school is meeting the
 
04:00:24.309 --> 04:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
requirements under 183e or they're not
 
04:00:25.870 --> 04:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
meeting those requirements so there
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
would have to be some level at which
 
04:00:29.189 --> 04:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
that is set with the federal
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
accountability system that's part of why
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
it sometimes breaks down and doesn't
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
work for the state side of things
 
04:00:36.550 --> 04:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
because the federal system is meant to
 
04:00:38.910 --> 04:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not a school is
 
04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
providing a certain level of services to
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
all the various groups of students that
 
04:00:44.990 --> 04:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
they have and we have different uh
 
04:00:47.550 --> 04:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
designations in terms of CSI schools TSI
 
04:00:49.750 --> 04:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
and atsi schools and depending on how a
 
04:00:51.149 --> 04:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
school is identified they may receive
 
04:00:53.189 --> 04:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
additional Federal funding the purpose
 
04:00:55.149 --> 04:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
of the state system would specifically
 
04:00:57.070 --> 04:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
be to determine whether a school is
 
04:00:58.469 --> 04:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
meeting the provision of adequate
 
04:00:59.750 --> 04:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
education or not and there would have to
 
04:01:01.750 --> 04:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
be some level there at which a decision
 
04:01:03.670 --> 04:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
could be made as to yes or no the school
 
04:01:06.510 --> 04:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
is doing that can I have a followup yes
 
04:01:09.309 --> 04:01:09.319 align:start position:0%
so I I'm kind of on this proficiency
 
04:01:14.110 --> 04:01:14.120 align:start position:0%
thing a little bit um so proficiency is
 
04:01:14.120 --> 04:01:15.149 align:start position:0%
thing a little bit um so proficiency is
just

04:01:15.149 --> 04:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:01:19.389 --> 04:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
is when somebody says that that 52% of
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
the students in New Hampshire are
 
04:01:25.990 --> 04:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
profession in X Y and Z and 48% art it
 
04:01:29.189 --> 04:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
says to the public that 52 are passing
 
04:01:32.429 --> 04:01:32.439 align:start position:0%
and 48% aren't but that's not really
 
04:01:36.070 --> 04:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
what proficiency is right um so what are
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
the different levels of accountability
 
04:01:42.309 --> 04:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
other than proficiency because I think
 
04:01:45.389 --> 04:01:45.399 align:start position:0%
proficiency um if if I was to go back in
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
my dinosaur years of teaching U of the
 
04:01:53.110 --> 04:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
ABCDEF uh proficiency would be a b or B+
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
probably in in some instances with New
 
04:01:57.830 --> 04:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so what are the other
 
04:02:00.670 --> 04:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
levels and and why do we focus so much
 
04:02:00.680 --> 04:02:02.389 align:start position:0%
levels and and why do we focus so much
on

04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:02:05.910 --> 04:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
proficiency there's really two types of
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
accountability systems that most States
 
04:02:11.070 --> 04:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
gravitate towards um one is a total
 
04:02:13.469 --> 04:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
scoring system where every school
 
04:02:16.910 --> 04:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
received A ranked score um and it may be
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know 0 to 100 and you could identify
 
04:02:21.070 --> 04:02:21.080 align:start position:0%
several different categories so you may
 
04:02:22.389 --> 04:02:22.399 align:start position:0%
have 10 different categories where
 
04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
you're looking at academic achievement
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
graduation rate uh CTE involvement
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
postsecondary Readiness and then a
 
04:02:31.389 --> 04:02:31.399 align:start position:0%
school would receive a score on each of
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
those the scores are weighted depending
 
04:02:35.830 --> 04:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
on how uh important you think each
 
04:02:37.830 --> 04:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
category is to the overall score and
 
04:02:40.149 --> 04:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
then you arrive at a final number um and
 
04:02:42.149 --> 04:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
many states have a system similar to
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
that where there's points ident
 
04:02:45.670 --> 04:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
identified for different weighted
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
categories um New Hampshire's current
 
04:02:49.630 --> 04:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
accountability system does a little bit
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
differently we we have those different
 
04:02:54.030 --> 04:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
indicator categories but we look at a
 
04:02:56.229 --> 04:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
school's performance in each of those
 
04:02:58.750 --> 04:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
indicator categories and they have to be
 
04:03:01.870 --> 04:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
in the bottom five% of all schools in
 
04:03:03.990 --> 04:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
each of those various categories in
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
order to be identified as a school in
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
need of improvement so it's not just
 
04:03:09.070 --> 04:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
they might be high in one but low in
 
04:03:10.990 --> 04:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
another one they're low in each of the
 
04:03:13.469 --> 04:03:13.479 align:start position:0%
different indicators but we're not what
 
04:03:14.670 --> 04:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
we're not doing New Hampshire is we
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
don't assign a score to each of those
 
04:03:17.990 --> 04:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
indicators and then aggregate them
 
04:03:21.309 --> 04:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
number yes thank you it's I still come
 
04:03:27.510 --> 04:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
back to the issue of proficiency because
 
04:03:29.349 --> 04:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's what keeps getting hammered to
 
04:03:32.149 --> 04:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
the public you know that that our kids
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
are not proficient in this they're not
 
04:03:35.990 --> 04:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
proficient in this or only 48% are
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
proficient in this and and again to the
 
04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
public it sounds like it's either a pass
 
04:03:43.389 --> 04:03:43.399 align:start position:0%
or a fail but it really isn't a pass or
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
a fail that there are different levels
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
so what are the different levels of
 
04:03:50.550 --> 04:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
indic I mean there must be an excellent
 
04:03:52.510 --> 04:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
right above proficient you must have
 
04:03:55.030 --> 04:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
outstanding or something what are the
 
04:03:57.710 --> 04:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
what are the levels that that are
 
04:04:01.030 --> 04:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
indicated on on accountability other
 
04:04:01.040 --> 04:04:02.030 align:start position:0%
indicated on on accountability other
than

04:04:02.030 --> 04:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:04:04.110 --> 04:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
proficiency so it depends on the
 
04:04:05.550 --> 04:04:05.560 align:start position:0%
category that you look at for example
 
04:04:07.550 --> 04:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
with graduation rate right now it's a
 
04:04:09.790 --> 04:04:09.800 align:start position:0%
cutoff score so any High School above
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
67% as a graduation rate is identified
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
as good any school below 67% would be
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
identified as uh not proficient in terms
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
of their graduation rate if we look at
 
04:04:23.030 --> 04:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
the state assessment um academic
 
04:04:25.830 --> 04:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
achievement on math Ela and science it
 
04:04:27.510 --> 04:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
is exactly what you're talking about you
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
know that traditional model of
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
proficiency where students are a level
 
04:04:33.070 --> 04:04:33.080 align:start position:0%
one two three or four where you have
 
04:04:35.710 --> 04:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
below proficient approaching proficient
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
proficient and then Advanced proficient
 
04:04:39.389 --> 04:04:39.399 align:start position:0%
um but one of the things we also look at
 
04:04:41.590 --> 04:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
is growth and growth comes from the
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
state assessment as well so as school
 
04:04:47.710 --> 04:04:47.720 align:start position:0%
could have um a low proficiency score in
 
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
terms of how their students are
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
performing on the state test but they
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
may have you know spent the last two
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
years or three years implementing new
 
04:04:55.710 --> 04:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
professional development programs
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
bringing a new curriculum in um doing
 
04:04:59.830 --> 04:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
parent and family engagement within
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
their community and so their students
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
are growing they may not have as high of
 
04:05:07.070 --> 04:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
a proficiency rate where all the
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
students are scoring at proficient but
 
04:05:10.710 --> 04:05:10.720 align:start position:0%
they may have brought a large percentage
 
04:05:12.349 --> 04:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
of their students up from level one to
 
04:05:14.349 --> 04:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
level two and so so you can have a
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
school that has a lower proficiency rate
 
04:05:18.189 --> 04:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
but a higher growth rate and that school
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
is not identified as a school in need of
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
improvement because their students are
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
are doing this they're progressing on an
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
upward track towards proficiency so in
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
the current system when we identify
 
04:05:29.950 --> 04:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
schools as needing an improvement you
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
would have to have both a low
 
04:05:33.750 --> 04:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
proficiency for your students and a low
 
04:05:35.670 --> 04:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
growth meaning your kids are scoring
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
lower on the test but they're also not
 
04:05:39.469 --> 04:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
showing a lot of progress in those lower
 
04:05:41.510 --> 04:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
areas um and then there are various
 
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
other indicators where you know we look
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
at college and career ready indicators
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
the number and percentage of students
 
04:05:49.710 --> 04:05:49.720 align:start position:0%
that are uh scoring a certain score on
 
04:05:53.030 --> 04:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
the ACT on the asab on the SAT uh the
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
number of students that are
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
participating in apprenticeship programs
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
and job-based learning uh the number of
 
04:05:58.990 --> 04:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
students that are earning career
 
04:06:00.990 --> 04:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
recognized and Industry recognized
 
04:06:03.149 --> 04:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
credentials um and the way that we
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
aggregate those numbers is we look to
 
04:06:08.149 --> 04:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
see um students that have done two or
 
04:06:09.790 --> 04:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
more of those indicators during their
 
04:06:11.830 --> 04:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
High School career so they took an AP
 
04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
class and they also participated in an
 
04:06:15.469 --> 04:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
appr ship uh or they scored a certain
 
04:06:17.229 --> 04:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
number on an asab and they also
 
04:06:19.389 --> 04:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
participate in job-based learning and
 
04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
then we look at the percentage of
 
04:06:23.110 --> 04:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
students that are meeting two of those
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
indicators and Report the percentage out
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
school one more okay one so so the I
 
04:06:34.349 --> 04:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
think the problem for me is what gets
 
04:06:36.149 --> 04:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
put out to the public and the public
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand growth and it doesn't
 
04:06:41.710 --> 04:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
understand all the you know the CTE and
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
the career ready and da d d da that that
 
04:06:47.950 --> 04:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
goes down in all these things and yet
 
04:06:52.389 --> 04:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
proficiency as you've explained is
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
like not the past fail part it's
 
04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
actually very close to the old-fashioned
 
04:07:03.389 --> 04:07:03.399 align:start position:0%
b or B+ and and so it's hard for me to
 
04:07:06.510 --> 04:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
think that when we send accountability
 
04:07:08.590 --> 04:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
out to the public and all we're talking
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
about is proficiency that that it's
 
04:07:14.670 --> 04:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
unrealistic in some places to think that
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
every kid is going to reach a
 
04:07:20.149 --> 04:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
B+ um and I'm just wondering and and I
 
04:07:23.429 --> 04:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
know this the every child succeeds thing
 
04:07:25.870 --> 04:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
was that it constantly raises right it's
 
04:07:28.510 --> 04:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
like if you if you have a certain
 
04:07:31.389 --> 04:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
percentage that re reaches proficiency
 
04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
then you've got to raise the proficiency
 
04:07:35.710 --> 04:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
level up a little bit it raises up so
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
that there's constantly uh schools that
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
will be at the
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
bottom in the Essa is that is that still
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
in effect because that was in effect
 
04:07:48.429 --> 04:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
before you don't necessarily have to
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
raise your proficiency rate up but one
 
04:07:51.950 --> 04:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
of the failings I think people have
 
04:07:54.429 --> 04:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
criticized the Essa for is that you're
 
04:07:56.790 --> 04:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
identifying the bottom 5% of schools no
 
04:07:59.950 --> 04:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
matter what so if 100% of your schools
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
were educating 100% of their students
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
well you would still have to identify
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom 5% under that requirement we
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
do see that in some student groups where
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
some of our student groups in New
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire overall are doing pretty well
 
04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
and yet we still identify the bottom 5%
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
because that's what the Federal Law
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
requires um so that has been a criticism
 
04:08:23.870 --> 04:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the Essa system I think a big part of
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
this comes down to communication um
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that we've really tried
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
hard to do within our office um
 
04:08:30.750 --> 04:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
especially when we talk about
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
proficiency U you know if we say that
 
04:08:36.109 --> 04:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
42% of our fifth graders you know are
 
04:08:39.109 --> 04:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
not scoring proficient on reading um I
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
think too often people hear well 42% of
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
students are not reading and that's not
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
the case 42% of our students are not
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
reading a fifth grade level many of
 
04:08:49.550 --> 04:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
those students are reading at a fourth
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
grade level they're they're reading
 
04:08:52.830 --> 04:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
they're just not quite at the fifth
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
grade level for those fifth graders
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
there and so I I do think language is
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
really important I think communication
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
is important especially when we're
 
04:09:01.750 --> 04:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
talking about accountability
 
04:09:04.030 --> 04:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
systems further questions representa
 
04:09:07.149 --> 04:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
Terry yes uh if I could shift years here
 
04:09:11.229 --> 04:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
and uh return to I think a prior
 
04:09:13.950 --> 04:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
question in bringing this bill forward
 
04:09:16.910 --> 04:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
it would appear as though you believe
 
04:09:18.030 --> 04:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
that a
 
04:09:22.990 --> 04:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
state um accountability system would
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
provide um for a a bet for better
 
04:09:29.510 --> 04:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes for um New Hampshire students
 
04:09:32.590 --> 04:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
than the the federal system and if
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
that's the case can you explain how it
 
04:09:36.550 --> 04:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
tell us a little bit about the
 
04:09:37.990 --> 04:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
background and the thinking that went
 
04:09:41.309 --> 04:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
into why you believe that is so and
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps give us a hypothetical or an
 
04:09:45.550 --> 04:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
example from another state that inspired
 
04:09:49.469 --> 04:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
you to bring forth this proposal so I
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
just want to point out we do currently
 
04:09:52.910 --> 04:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
have two systems in place we have the
 
04:09:54.790 --> 04:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
federal system and the state system the
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
state system just mirrors the federal
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
system right now and so last year when
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
we were having conversations
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
specifically with this group um there
 
04:10:05.229 --> 04:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
were a lot of concerns with what exists
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the federal system and really if that
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
belongs in the state system and that's
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
really why we are trying to do this is
 
04:10:14.429 --> 04:10:14.439 align:start position:0%
it's like we are because the full
 
04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
proposal of what we wanted to do last
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
time failed it we felt it failed really
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
because of a lot of the kind of
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
technical issues with the existing
 
04:10:24.910 --> 04:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
system and not necessarily the actual
 
04:10:26.590 --> 04:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
proposal what we were trying to bring
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
forward so I I want I don't want to keep
 
04:10:31.269 --> 04:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
harping on graduation rates but there
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
was a robust conversation in this room
 
04:10:35.750 --> 04:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
about graduation rates probably almost
 
04:10:39.109 --> 04:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
an hour and people saying 67% is not
 
04:10:41.630 --> 04:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
high enough and well whether that is or
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
is not that's what's in the federal law
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
and because the two are mirrored right
 
04:10:48.109 --> 04:10:48.119 align:start position:0%
now we have to use that um and then by
 
04:10:50.030 --> 04:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
us having the system well by us having
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
an accountability task force to look at
 
04:10:53.309 --> 04:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
our existing system that's when we can
 
04:10:56.189 --> 04:10:56.199 align:start position:0%
say 67% maybe that's not maybe it needs
 
04:10:58.670 --> 04:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
to be 93% or something like that for New
 
04:10:59.630 --> 04:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where we do have a
 
04:11:01.950 --> 04:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally higher graduation rate um
 
04:11:01.960 --> 04:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
traditionally higher graduation rate um
and

04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
so right now um we don't have the
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
flexibility because two systems mirror
 
04:11:10.750 --> 04:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
each other the other thing too is is
 
04:11:12.990 --> 04:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to measure whether a
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
school district is providing an adequate
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
education as defined by RSA
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
193e that is not what the federal
 
04:11:22.510 --> 04:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
accountability system is looking at the
 
04:11:23.790 --> 04:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
federal accountability system is looking
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
at an entirely different set of
 
04:11:27.030 --> 04:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
indicators established in the federal
 
04:11:29.349 --> 04:11:29.359 align:start position:0%
every student succeeds act and so if
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at different measurements
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
and different indicators and different
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
reasons for doing this there does need
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
to be some segregation between the two
 
04:11:36.239 --> 04:11:37.950 align:start position:0%
to be some segregation between the two
of

04:11:37.950 --> 04:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much uh represent
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
Miler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:11:44.670 --> 04:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
for being here here so here's the
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
question I have so we you have this um
 
04:11:50.590 --> 04:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
task force you get your work done you've
 
04:11:53.710 --> 04:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
identified those uh schools that are
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
very proficient those are middle
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
proficients those are lower proficients
 
04:11:58.990 --> 04:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
you've got this data you've got the
 
04:12:00.870 --> 04:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
metrics that you've been figured
 
04:12:03.590 --> 04:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
out what is the role of the department
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
at that point in time in dealing with
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
those students and those school
 
04:12:10.830 --> 04:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
districts that may be less proficient
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
than others so that is a question that
 
04:12:14.710 --> 04:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
we talked about last year too and that's
 
04:12:16.469 --> 04:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
a huge challenge the department has
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
right now um there are um steps the
 
04:12:21.389 --> 04:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is supposed to
 
04:12:23.469 --> 04:12:23.479 align:start position:0%
take that's an RSA 193 if a school
 
04:12:25.149 --> 04:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
district is identified is not providing
 
04:12:27.109 --> 04:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
an adequate education um but the
 
04:12:28.590 --> 04:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have specific
 
04:12:31.469 --> 04:12:31.479 align:start position:0%
resources to implement those Steps step
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
number one though is getting what that
 
04:12:36.389 --> 04:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
system should be in place so um so the
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
task force helps the department Define
 
04:12:39.870 --> 04:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
essentially what the system is going to
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
be we do that in collaboration with the
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight comme and we'll
 
04:12:46.070 --> 04:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
eventually need legislation to bring
 
04:12:48.309 --> 04:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
that forward to codify that in law so
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
that's step one step two the department
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
actually implement the system so we do
 
04:12:54.389 --> 04:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
those calculations we collect data we
 
04:12:56.229 --> 04:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
you know do provide those measurements
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
and whatnot that's a lot of work the
 
04:12:59.910 --> 04:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
department is does have the appropriate
 
04:13:02.429 --> 04:13:02.439 align:start position:0%
resources to do that we feel um and we
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
can do that work kind of given our
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
existing systems but then so once we
 
04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
come up with that list of the schools
 
04:13:09.630 --> 04:13:09.640 align:start position:0%
that are not providing adequate
 
04:13:12.189 --> 04:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
education through either ibass or pbass
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
there is a whole techn IAL correction
 
04:13:16.109 --> 04:13:16.119 align:start position:0%
and action plan which was were and and I
 
04:13:17.910 --> 04:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what the answer is we had
 
04:13:19.630 --> 04:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
that exact same question come up last
 
04:13:22.469 --> 04:13:22.479 align:start position:0%
year and we we said you know the schools
 
04:13:24.910 --> 04:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
that are failing Federal accountability
 
04:13:26.950 --> 04:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
so the CSI schools there is federal
 
04:13:29.070 --> 04:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
funding that exists and supports those
 
04:13:30.750 --> 04:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
schools and provides additional money
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
but if a school is identified right now
 
04:13:35.109 --> 04:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
as a state CSI school and not a federal
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
CSI school we are we don't have any
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
additional resources that we can provide
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
them so that's a very good question that
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
maybe the legislature can solve but
 
04:13:44.670 --> 04:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
that's kind of step two of where we need
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
to get with this show a followup then so
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
potentially what might happen then I'm
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
hearing you right that one of the
 
04:13:54.349 --> 04:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations as you begin to look at
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
this one of the recommendations of the
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
task force might be what is the Staffing
 
04:14:02.349 --> 04:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
necessary as well as the funding
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to have the con the
 
04:14:07.389 --> 04:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate content people in the
 
04:14:09.349 --> 04:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
department that can actually reach out
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
to school districts and provide some
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a technical assistance or uh
 
04:14:16.710 --> 04:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
professional development assistance to
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
help improve those particular schools
 
04:14:20.990 --> 04:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
that need that Improvement is that is
 
04:14:23.070 --> 04:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
that a far reach for what I'm saying
 
04:14:24.670 --> 04:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
here or I don't think it's a far reach I
 
04:14:26.550 --> 04:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
just think it's definitely like step
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
three four and five and we're just
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out got get the DAT
 
04:14:32.070 --> 04:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
first I understand that okay but yeah I
 
04:14:34.830 --> 04:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
mean I I mean having a full system in
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
place is really what the goal is
 
04:14:38.550 --> 04:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
eventually I mean we need to define the
 
04:14:40.030 --> 04:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
system implement the system and then
 
04:14:42.389 --> 04:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
help help you know make sure that
 
04:14:43.870 --> 04:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's on track back to um
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
complying with the
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
system we tried to help out remember we
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
had the analyst to be there working with
 
04:14:53.149 --> 04:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
you we never funded that money Nate
 
04:14:54.910 --> 04:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but that would have helped
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
in this process it certainly would have
 
04:14:58.830 --> 04:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
and it certainly would helped with a lot
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the concerns representative Tanner
 
04:15:01.950 --> 04:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
brought up to especially about you know
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
when because we have a lot of people
 
04:15:04.550 --> 04:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
from the public that call and they want
 
04:15:06.309 --> 04:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
to have a deep dive into the data and we
 
04:15:07.950 --> 04:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the capacity to do that work
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
at the department um so it it would help
 
04:15:13.309 --> 04:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
with a lot of this y thank other further
 
04:15:15.630 --> 04:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
04:15:18.189 --> 04:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
you it goes back to T 266 doesn't it
 
04:15:24.429 --> 04:15:24.439 align:start position:0%
hearkens s we went
 
04:15:24.439 --> 04:15:26.469 align:start position:0%
hearkens s we went
yeah

didn't get one from the
 
04:15:34.309 --> 04:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
senator you might send another blank one
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
up we'll fill it out oh we did we filled
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
it out thank

you ready for me yes we are okay great
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon members of the
 
04:16:52.109 --> 04:16:52.119 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
04:16:54.229 --> 04:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
Becky Whitley I'm honored to in uh to
 
04:16:56.670 --> 04:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
represent Senate District 15 which
 
04:16:58.590 --> 04:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
includes of course the wonderful city of
 
04:17:02.429 --> 04:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
conard hopkington and B so for your
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
consideration Excuse me while I get my
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
papers in
 
04:17:08.550 --> 04:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
order for your consideration I have
 
04:17:12.070 --> 04:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
before you Senate Bill 526 so as a
 
04:17:15.590 --> 04:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
mother of a Elementary aged uh child in
 
04:17:17.070 --> 04:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
public school I think it's really
 
04:17:19.149 --> 04:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
important that we have the conversation
 
04:17:21.830 --> 04:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
in this bill to address safety and of
 
04:17:24.790 --> 04:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
course to improve learning in our Public
 
04:17:27.429 --> 04:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
Schools so I think that we all know that
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
as our climate warms our aging schools
 
04:17:32.109 --> 04:17:32.119 align:start position:0%
buildings and infrastructure are going
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
to have to adapt it's just a reality
 
04:17:36.910 --> 04:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen historic heat waves across
 
04:17:38.670 --> 04:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
the United States over the past several
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
years this has forced many schools to
 
04:17:43.429 --> 04:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
shut down pivot to remote learning or
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
dismiss students earlier in the day I
 
04:17:47.429 --> 04:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
know it's sort of hard to remember on
 
04:17:50.349 --> 04:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
this very Cold Spring day but we're not
 
04:17:52.750 --> 04:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
immune to heat waves in New Hampshire
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
anymore it's just a reality temperatures
 
04:17:57.550 --> 04:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have risen more than 3
 
04:17:59.109 --> 04:17:59.119 align:start position:0%
degrees Fahrenheit since the beginning
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
of the 20th century yet most schools as
 
04:18:03.870 --> 04:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
we know don't have air conditioning
 
04:18:05.950 --> 04:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
units that are really well equipped to
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
cope with sweltering heat or really at
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
all this bill takes a very small step
 
04:18:13.710 --> 04:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
towards addressing this issue to ensure
 
04:18:15.630 --> 04:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
that our students have adequate physical
 
04:18:18.550 --> 04:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
learning environments there are numerous
 
04:18:20.349 --> 04:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
bodies of research which have shown the
 
04:18:22.189 --> 04:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
negative effects that extreme heat
 
04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
temperatures can H have on students
 
04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
ability to learn their social emotional
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
skills and their ability to perform on
 
04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
exams as you will see the Senate amended
 
04:18:32.830 --> 04:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
this bill um from the one is introduced
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
it's a more distilled version but of
 
04:18:38.229 --> 04:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
course has the same intent the statutory
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
change is now under the existing School
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
air quality statute rather than the
 
04:18:42.399 --> 04:18:43.389 align:start position:0%
air quality statute rather than the
prior

04:18:43.389 --> 04:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
prior
 
04:18:47.229 --> 04:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
um infr infra infrastructure fund um
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
this was a very good suggestion from the
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education the amended Bill
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
also gives scho school districts the
 
04:18:55.309 --> 04:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to establish a plan with
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
temperature range goals but as with the
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
original Bill still sets a minimum and
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
maximum uh when classrooms can be
 
04:19:04.109 --> 04:19:04.119 align:start position:0%
occupied I am absolutely happy to take
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions but we'll surely defer more
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
technical questions to the the folks
 
04:19:10.229 --> 04:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
behind me um I will note that this
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
amendment uh the bill is presented
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
before you passed out of the Senate
 
04:19:17.229 --> 04:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
education committee uh unanimously was
 
04:19:18.990 --> 04:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar and it did pass
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
the Senate on the consent calendar thank
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
you very much I'm happy to take any
 
04:19:23.790 --> 04:19:23.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator are there
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
Dy thank you very much and thank you for
 
04:19:35.070 --> 04:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question my pleasure so this
 
04:19:38.189 --> 04:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
just asks the school district to develop
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
policies right and to develop a plan
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
right I think you know uh the
 
04:19:45.109 --> 04:19:45.119 align:start position:0%
conversation this is just the start of a
 
04:19:47.109 --> 04:19:47.119 align:start position:0%
conversation and so really we're just
 
04:19:48.990 --> 04:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
asking that to happen at the local level
 
04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
and sort of think through as they are
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
likely already doing but it's really
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
important to set these temperature
 
04:19:55.590 --> 04:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
ranges because we really know from a
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
whole host of evidence that range where
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
students need to uh that students need
 
04:20:00.239 --> 04:20:02.750 align:start position:0%
students need to uh that students need
to

04:20:02.750 --> 04:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:06.109 --> 04:20:06.119 align:start position:0%
learn yeah I guess I'm just kind of
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
considering that they've already done
 
04:20:10.349 --> 04:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
that um I mean in a local level knows
 
04:20:12.030 --> 04:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
better what side of the building thing
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
is on and what the temperature reflects
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
what Sunshine they're getting in the
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
room for example and if there's really a
 
04:20:21.550 --> 04:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
way you can make this fit all the
 
04:20:23.149 --> 04:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
classrooms in all the
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
states yeah thank you for that question
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
I think there are some school districts
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
that really do have plans and they
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps have appropriate air
 
04:20:32.349 --> 04:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
conditioning but there are many that
 
04:20:34.790 --> 04:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
don't um I I believe at least in the
 
04:20:36.710 --> 04:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
Senate there was a lot of testimony
 
04:20:40.030 --> 04:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
about the temperature of some schools uh
 
04:20:41.790 --> 04:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
and what students have experienced and
 
04:20:43.149 --> 04:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
what teachers have experi experience so
 
04:20:45.790 --> 04:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
this just sets that range and asks our
 
04:20:47.309 --> 04:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
schools to come up with plans if we're
 
04:20:48.429 --> 04:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
out of that
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
range thanks further questions represent
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you for taking my question
 
04:20:57.389 --> 04:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious why uh the policy
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
addressed that addresses methods of Min
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
minimizing or eliminating emiss
 
04:21:04.630 --> 04:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
emissions from idling Vehicles was uh
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
Struck from this particular part that's
 
04:21:08.910 --> 04:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
a good question and one that the folks
 
04:21:10.349 --> 04:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
behind me and perhaps the Department of
 
04:21:12.349 --> 04:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
Education could answer thank you for
 
04:21:12.359 --> 04:21:14.389 align:start position:0%
Education could answer thank you for
that

04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:14.399 --> 04:21:15.510 align:start position:0%
that
represent

04:21:15.510 --> 04:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:21:18.109 --> 04:21:18.119 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:21:20.149 --> 04:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
senator for being here I wanted to ask a
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about I mean obviously a lot
 
04:21:23.349 --> 04:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
of this it makes a good deal of sense to
 
04:21:24.710 --> 04:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
keep things in a proper temperature
 
04:21:27.030 --> 04:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
range in under especially under ideal
 
04:21:28.990 --> 04:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances but can you speak a little
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
bit to the um the need to close a
 
04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
classroom as soon as a temperature say
 
04:21:37.910 --> 04:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
drops below 60 when I woke up this
 
04:21:40.030 --> 04:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
morning my house was probably about
 
04:21:44.910 --> 04:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
55 and I mean it was okay for a short
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
period of time and compared to shutting
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
it down altogether obviously it seems
 
04:21:52.910 --> 04:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
that it would be better to have some
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
learning going on at 59 degrees for a
 
04:21:56.710 --> 04:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
short period until it came up and
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
instead of zero learning because you
 
04:22:00.189 --> 04:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
close class room thank you for that
 
04:22:02.349 --> 04:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
question I mean I think this bill was
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
written in Reliance upon the data
 
04:22:06.790 --> 04:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
showing that optimal period where
 
04:22:08.950 --> 04:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
students can learn and that if the
 
04:22:11.109 --> 04:22:11.119 align:start position:0%
temperatures are too low or too high
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
students are just not going to be able
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
to to be available for learning both you
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
know uh in their minds and then uh
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
emotionally and so it is really based on
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
that body of evidence thank you for that
 
04:22:24.030 --> 04:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
question represent Damon thank you Mr
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:22:28.030 --> 04:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
and for bringing this forward um I have
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
some particular interest in this because
 
04:22:32.109 --> 04:22:32.119 align:start position:0%
part of my district includes Claremont
 
04:22:33.510 --> 04:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the high school Stevens High School
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
in Claremont is a very old facility
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
three stories high and they in fact
 
04:22:43.469 --> 04:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
closed School uh early in the fall 23
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
term because it was literally unbearably
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
hot people were passing out and it was
 
04:22:51.469 --> 04:22:51.479 align:start position:0%
not a very healthy
 
04:22:54.910 --> 04:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
situation my question is regarding uh
 
04:22:57.149 --> 04:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
line 89 where it says develop and
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
Implement a classroom temperature
 
04:23:01.990 --> 04:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
control plan so if we're asking for
 
04:23:04.269 --> 04:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
implementation there are probably some
 
04:23:07.870 --> 04:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
resources that would need to be attached
 
04:23:11.070 --> 04:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
to that and I don't see that indicated
 
04:23:13.710 --> 04:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
here you're correct there's not a fiscal
 
04:23:15.109 --> 04:23:15.119 align:start position:0%
note attached to this I know many
 
04:23:17.070 --> 04:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
schools have been able to access certain
 
04:23:19.469 --> 04:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
federal funds and arpa dollars but I
 
04:23:20.469 --> 04:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
think you're right there could
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
potentially be um some costs associated
 
04:23:25.429 --> 04:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
but really we're just asking them to
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
develop a plan at this point again it's
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
just the beginning of a conversation
 
04:23:30.750 --> 04:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
sort of think through what they might
 
04:23:33.149 --> 04:23:33.159 align:start position:0%
need to implement that plan thank you
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
04:23:37.469 --> 04:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
committee represent mcdonal thank you Mr
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you senator for bringing
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
this forward to follow up on
 
04:23:43.109 --> 04:23:43.119 align:start position:0%
representative bel's question question
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
line 12 and 13 says the plan could shall
 
04:23:49.389 --> 04:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
also include procedures for closing
 
04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
classrooms do the procedures necessarily
 
04:23:53.950 --> 04:23:53.960 align:start position:0%
have to say that the classroom closes or
 
04:23:55.469 --> 04:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
is that up to local control in the
 
04:23:57.790 --> 04:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard discretion or how is that
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
intended to be
 
04:24:03.070 --> 04:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted right and so I you know I
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
also my house was 55 or 52 degrees the
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
other day because we did not have power
 
04:24:09.870 --> 04:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
in hackington for many days um it's very
 
04:24:11.990 --> 04:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
cold below 60 particularly for our
 
04:24:14.149 --> 04:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
kiddos and so I think it was very
 
04:24:15.630 --> 04:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
important to all the stakeholders
 
04:24:18.189 --> 04:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
involved that we did have an actual
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
temperature for when it's just not safe
 
04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
for kids to be in school thanks further
 
04:24:25.469 --> 04:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon War my apologies um I have to
 
04:24:38.189 --> 04:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
go back to Senate Judiciary so my
 
04:24:40.870 --> 04:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
apologies for leaving the committee sure
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:56.309 --> 04:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:58.269 --> 04:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
Christina thank you chairman lad good
 
04:24:59.670 --> 04:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee be
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
Christina from the New Hampshire school
 
04:25:02.750 --> 04:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
boards Association we are opposed to
 
04:25:04.550 --> 04:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
04:25:08.109 --> 04:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
526 um I'm certainly not diminishing um
 
04:25:11.149 --> 04:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
you know how hot it was uh last June
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
when that heat wave came through through
 
04:25:15.109 --> 04:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
and how that may impact students ability
 
04:25:17.070 --> 04:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
to learn or or teachers's ability to
 
04:25:18.790 --> 04:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
teach properly but I think that this
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
bill is simply trying to um legislate
 
04:25:23.550 --> 04:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit of common sense I
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't think we need um to put in law
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
that school boards have to develop plans
 
04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
to tell the principal to open a window
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
or or turn on a fan or perhaps move some
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the kids to the the back side of the
 
04:25:36.030 --> 04:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
building where the sun isn't beating
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
down on it um as I was speaking um with
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh with Miss Tuttle um from Nea when
 
04:25:44.070 --> 04:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
this bill was in the Senate um you know
 
04:25:46.389 --> 04:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
I also said that we can school boards
 
04:25:48.710 --> 04:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
can schedule um our school calendar out
 
04:25:50.590 --> 04:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
to June 30 if the teachers want to stay
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
in school until the end of June um
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
instead of um you know trying to trying
 
04:25:55.950 --> 04:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
to get them out the beginning of the
 
04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
middle middle of June if we have to
 
04:25:59.630 --> 04:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
close school on multiple days cuz it's
 
04:26:02.109 --> 04:26:02.119 align:start position:0%
you know we get a heat wave of 100° for
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
3 days or 4 days or a week or whatever
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
it might be um also be mindful too um
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
that um the Department of Education um
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
foreclosed the ability of School
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
District to op to operate um or have um
 
04:26:17.750 --> 04:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
remote instruction days that count as
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
the number of the number of days that
 
04:26:21.229 --> 04:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
are required to to meet the statutory
 
04:26:23.550 --> 04:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
requirements of 180 days per year so
 
04:26:25.269 --> 04:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
there's no option for school boards or
 
04:26:26.590 --> 04:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
or school districts to implement a
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
remote learning day either if we're
 
04:26:29.950 --> 04:26:29.960 align:start position:0%
getting a heat wave where it's going to
 
04:26:32.469 --> 04:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
where this bill would somehow be be
 
04:26:35.790 --> 04:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
implicated um you know we school boards
 
04:26:37.630 --> 04:26:37.640 align:start position:0%
Association I I talked to a handful of
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
superintendents when that when that
 
04:26:41.429 --> 04:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
Heatwave came through last June I
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
believe it was and and superintendant
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
were making rational Common Sense
 
04:26:48.109 --> 04:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
decisions without having to have a plan
 
04:26:49.870 --> 04:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
and without having to have a statute
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
they open Windows they turned on fans um
 
04:26:54.349 --> 04:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
I know teachers pulled some of their
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
money and somebody ran out to Walmart to
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
buy popsicles for the kids so they could
 
04:26:59.469 --> 04:26:59.479 align:start position:0%
have you know a popsicle once or twice a
 
04:27:01.429 --> 04:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
day to cool down a little bit um we
 
04:27:02.950 --> 04:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
didn't need a law we didn't need you
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
know a written plan in order to do so um
 
04:27:09.149 --> 04:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
you know relative to the the the the the
 
04:27:11.710 --> 04:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
degree range that's on on the on on the
 
04:27:13.269 --> 04:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
bill I guess
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at at lines 12 and
 
04:27:18.189 --> 04:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
13 if the if the if the temperature is
 
04:27:20.189 --> 04:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
getting below 60° on that school
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
facility I'm guessing maybe the furnace
 
04:27:23.710 --> 04:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
or the boiler isn't working and you're
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to have to close
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
school anyway um you know the upper
 
04:27:30.070 --> 04:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
range temperatures which I think is some
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
spurred on some of this bill um uh uh uh
 
04:27:35.550 --> 04:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
you know that's going to be an active
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
nature and and and we're going to have
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
to find ways to to figure that out um
 
04:27:41.429 --> 04:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
the other question I have about the the
 
04:27:44.750 --> 04:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
the the below 60° or or above 88° what
 
04:27:46.349 --> 04:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
happens if the if the temperature
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
fluctuates throughout throughout the
 
04:27:49.429 --> 04:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
course of the day we have to close that
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
classroom we're going to send kids to
 
04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
either double up a classroom or those
 
04:27:53.990 --> 04:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
kids are going to go get some
 
04:27:55.990 --> 04:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
instruction in the cafeteria which is
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
not in the direct sun it's 90° in the
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
classroom a a cold front rainstorm pulls
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
in and it drops 5 degrees in 3 minutes
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
and an hour later the Sun comes back out
 
04:28:08.429 --> 04:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
and it's it's 90° and where the kid's
 
04:28:10.590 --> 04:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
going to be going back and and going
 
04:28:12.750 --> 04:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
forth and to represent a belt question
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
about there should still be some
 
04:28:16.229 --> 04:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
delivery of instruction relative to that
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
so um for those reasons the School Board
 
04:28:20.910 --> 04:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
Association is opposed to the Bill thank
 
04:28:22.670 --> 04:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
you are there questions of the school
 
04:28:22.680 --> 04:28:24.229 align:start position:0%
you are there questions of the school
boards

04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
boards
 
04:28:26.109 --> 04:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
Association not seeing thank you very
 
04:28:38.590 --> 04:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:42.910 --> 04:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
tutle and Brian hi okay is that okay is

you I won't double up on time I promise
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon House Education thank
 
04:28:51.510 --> 04:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
you my name is Megan Tuttle for the
 
04:28:53.389 --> 04:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
record president of Na New Hampshire
 
04:28:55.229 --> 04:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
representing about 17,000 Educators
 
04:28:57.229 --> 04:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
across the state we're here in support
 
04:29:00.269 --> 04:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
of this bill um I have written testimony
 
04:29:01.990 --> 04:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
that I will pass in it has links to
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
studies that you can go through um at
 
04:29:06.070 --> 04:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
your leader after this and then I also
 
04:29:07.870 --> 04:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
have some testimony from a teacher in do
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
that couldn't be here today because
 
04:29:10.830 --> 04:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
she's teaching and I'll pass that that
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
in as well at the end um so we know
 
04:29:15.269 --> 04:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
extreme temperatures are on the rise
 
04:29:18.109 --> 04:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
both um hot and cold and so this isn't
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
just about how hot it was in September
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
of this year besides being president of
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
Anya New Hampshire I'm a mom of three
 
04:29:25.309 --> 04:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
kids in conquered school districts which
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard before and I can
 
04:29:29.109 --> 04:29:29.119 align:start position:0%
speak from personal experience that one
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
week that we had at the beginning of the
 
04:29:32.349 --> 04:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
school year was horrible it was horrible
 
04:29:34.830 --> 04:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
for educators it was horrible for kids
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
my kids were coming home dripping sweat
 
04:29:38.910 --> 04:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
um a lot of District or a lot of schools
 
04:29:41.189 --> 04:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
in conquered had water you know cloths
 
04:29:43.349 --> 04:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
wet cloths over the foreheads spritzing
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
them with water kindergarteners Etc
 
04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the extreme here
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't just a normal day that gets a
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
little warm this is really about the
 
04:29:55.269 --> 04:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
extreme it also you know when this this
 
04:29:57.710 --> 04:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
summer or fall I should say when this
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
was happening we had a triple storm
 
04:30:01.630 --> 04:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
because at the same time the lead levels
 
04:30:02.830 --> 04:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
that were reduced last year in the
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
legislature which I'm very thankful for
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
shut down most of the water bubblers in
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
conquered School District so there was
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
lack of water and there was the extreme
 
04:30:12.670 --> 04:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
temperatures I do have pictures to show
 
04:30:14.710 --> 04:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
you classrooms that were above 90° some
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the classrooms hit 85° and over at
 
04:30:18.790 --> 04:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
7:00 in the morning and they just Rose
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
from there putting a fan in the
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
classroom I was a teacher in e8th grade
 
04:30:23.149 --> 04:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
for 18 years in two different schools in
 
04:30:24.429 --> 04:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
different classrooms putting a fan in
 
04:30:26.070 --> 04:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
the classroom doesn't do anything it
 
04:30:27.750 --> 04:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
literally just circulates the warm air
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
around the classroom um and so that
 
04:30:31.510 --> 04:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
really is not something that's going to
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
solve this problem and like I said this
 
04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
isn't just about the warm temperatures
 
04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
and the hot temperatures this is also
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
about the cold temperatures in Berlin
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
this fall I was speaking or this winter
 
04:30:41.830 --> 04:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me I was speaking with a member
 
04:30:43.149 --> 04:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
of up there the high school didn't have
 
04:30:46.269 --> 04:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
heat in half of their building so their
 
04:30:48.510 --> 04:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
solution was to blast the heat in the
 
04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
half of the building that had it and
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
then put a fan to try to get into the
 
04:30:52.990 --> 04:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
other side of the building that's just
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
not acceptable the temperatures are
 
04:30:56.830 --> 04:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
getting colder they're getting warmer
 
04:30:58.389 --> 04:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's the reality and so we need to be
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
able to fix this um the New Hampshire
 
04:31:04.030 --> 04:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
House and Senate canceled business in
 
04:31:05.429 --> 04:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
the legislative office building this
 
04:31:06.990 --> 04:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
year because the air conditioning wasn't
 
04:31:09.309 --> 04:31:09.319 align:start position:0%
working so this was canceled for
 
04:31:12.469 --> 04:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
legislators coming in to work but we had
 
04:31:14.269 --> 04:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
Educators and students all across New
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that were still expected to
 
04:31:17.269 --> 04:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
teach to do their jobs and to learn in
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
those same conditions it learning isn't
 
04:31:21.870 --> 04:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
happening the answer I don't believe
 
04:31:24.149 --> 04:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
Statewide is just cancel school and make
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
it up at the end of the year part of
 
04:31:27.870 --> 04:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
this was leaving it up to the Local
 
04:31:29.229 --> 04:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
District so that they could decide what
 
04:31:31.630 --> 04:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
worked best for them in conquered alone
 
04:31:33.389 --> 04:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
the buildings are all different ages
 
04:31:36.429 --> 04:31:36.439 align:start position:0%
Beaver Meadow is an old building
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
Christal mccauliff and have it down in
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
your new building so they were built
 
04:31:41.149 --> 04:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
differently I know that Beaver Meadow
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
this morning I went to pick up one of my
 
04:31:44.309 --> 04:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
sons for a doctor's appointment and I
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
was talking with the secretary and she
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
said that they're going to be shut all
 
04:31:48.590 --> 04:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
summer because they are starting this
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
summer to look at the air flow in the
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
building it's an old old building if you
 
04:31:53.630 --> 04:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
haven't been to Beaver Meadow it's
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
probably right up there with runlet
 
04:31:57.109 --> 04:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
Middle School um and so they're working
 
04:31:59.349 --> 04:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
on it this bill though would allow it to
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
happen across the state so that it's not
 
04:32:02.630 --> 04:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
just some districts being able to do it
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
and not others this would bring it so
 
04:32:06.429 --> 04:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
that everybody is there we know that
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
when classrooms are too hot students
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
struggle to learn educators are
 
04:32:11.229 --> 04:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
struggling to teach they perform worse
 
04:32:13.510 --> 04:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
on tests when it's that warm everybody
 
04:32:15.189 --> 04:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
here I think could agree Brian and
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
myself included when you're really that
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
warm and I was in Arizona this summer at
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
115 degrees you're cranky it's not
 
04:32:22.349 --> 04:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable when you're cold it's not
 
04:32:23.590 --> 04:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable we that middle school
 
04:32:25.830 --> 04:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday morning I got an email at 9:45
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
in the morning that the heat was just
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
starting to work again it was 51
 
04:32:33.189 --> 04:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
degrees for an hour and a half it was 51
 
04:32:35.750 --> 04:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
degrees should they have deleted it
 
04:32:37.109 --> 04:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
probably but that's up to the
 
04:32:38.269 --> 04:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
superintendent Murphy and I'm not going
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
to get into that but it's the same
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
effect when it's cold cold in your house
 
04:32:44.630 --> 04:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
when you lose heat it's not comfortable
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
you can't really be doing much um the
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage committee as well as
 
04:32:50.030 --> 04:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
surveys that we've done of our members
 
04:32:51.550 --> 04:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
indicate student Behavior challenges are
 
04:32:53.389 --> 04:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
a top stress among members you can
 
04:32:55.030 --> 04:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
imagine what those behaviors are
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
starting to be like when the
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
temperatures are 90 90 Plus in
 
04:33:00.750 --> 04:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
classrooms or when they're even colder
 
04:33:03.149 --> 04:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
we really believe that Senate Bill 526
 
04:33:05.349 --> 04:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh 526 excuse me strikes a balance
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
between setting standards to optimize
 
04:33:08.310 --> 04:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
student learning and also acknowledging
 
04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
that some temperatures are just
 
04:33:12.189 --> 04:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
challenging um but unsafe there's more
 
04:33:13.629 --> 04:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
in my testimony so I won't go into more
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the written but essentially we really
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
think this is something that needs to be
 
04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
addressed and leaving it up to the
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
districts is going to let each local
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
decide and determine what's going to be
 
04:33:23.990 --> 04:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
best for them and I'm happy to take
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much other
 
04:33:27.789 --> 04:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
represent Terry um in speaking with your
 
04:33:32.830 --> 04:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh colleagues in your Association in
 
04:33:35.109 --> 04:33:35.119 align:start position:0%
other states are are you aware of U
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
others if other states have have taken
 
04:33:40.670 --> 04:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
similar uh measures than what is being

sponsor of the bill we're addressing 339
 
04:36:25.629 --> 04:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman it's great to be back in
 
04:36:28.150 --> 04:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
front of my uh colleagues from the house
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that I know your
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee has dealt with uh already in
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
another itineration what I passed out
 
04:36:37.869 --> 04:36:37.879 align:start position:0%
was basically a version of what you
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
passed through the house and then we
 
04:36:42.189 --> 04:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
passed through the Senate um this bill
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
deals with the repealing the FAFSA
 
04:36:46.070 --> 04:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
requirement the requirement that all
 
04:36:48.551 --> 04:36:48.561 align:start position:0%
parents must complete a FAFSA in order
 
04:36:50.750 --> 04:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
for the child to get a public high
 
04:36:54.349 --> 04:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
school diploma um I had heard from many
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
of my constituents that this was an
 
04:36:59.150 --> 04:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
intrusive uh process that they did not
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
find most necessary they resented the
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
sort of demand upon their time and that
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
for some students it just didn't make
 
04:37:08.670 --> 04:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
sense they had intended to uh attend
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
trade school or um go right out into the
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
the workforce so for that reason I
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
sponsored the bill I know you've already
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
heard all the conversation because
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
you've already passed a similar
 
04:37:21.709 --> 04:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
bill I think my solution may be a bit
 
04:37:24.629 --> 04:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
more elegant it certainly as shorter um
 
04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
but the house version gets the job done
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
as well and I I think that would be just
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
fine and with that Mr chairman I'll
 
04:37:32.789 --> 04:37:32.799 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony I'm happy to take
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%

04:37:40.429 --> 04:37:40.439 align:start position:0%

04:37:40.439 --> 04:37:41.949 align:start position:0%
senator thinks he has more more elegant
version

04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%

04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
