fn

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
this was presented this morning
 
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
to full finance
 
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
along with an amendment
 
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.670 align:start position:0%
along with an amendment
and

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
so what's under consideration right now
 
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.389 align:start position:0%
so what's under consideration right now
is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
445 or 445 as amended
 
00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
and apparently there's some in interest
 
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
in having a discussion about the
 
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
amendment or the verbiage
 
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
i guess would be in the basic bill and
 
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment as far as starting
 
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.710 align:start position:0%
the amendment as far as starting
construction

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
represented mooney you have you have a
 
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
concern thank you mr chairman in the
 
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
hennessey amendment so that's number
 
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
lines 11 through 13.
 
00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this amendment offered by
 
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
the senator is to add the word
 
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.590 align:start position:0%
the senator is to add the word
successfully

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
before challenges i understand that
 
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
but there was there was discussion
 
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
at the hearing this morning about that
 
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
sentence and it is a little
 
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.550 align:start position:0%
sentence and it is a little
clumsy

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
clumsy
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
my thought is
 
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
if we take out the words beginning at
 
00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 align:start position:0%
the end of line 11 because
 
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
starting in line 12 construction has
 
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.430 align:start position:0%
starting in line 12 construction has
commenced

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
commenced
 
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
if those four words were deleted
 
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
to me it seems like the sentence would
 
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
be clearer
 
00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
but i'm guessing there are
 
00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
reasons for why
 
00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 align:start position:0%
those words were in the original bill
 
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 align:start position:0%
and the hennessey amendment and it's my
 
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
understanding a member of the audience
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
can speak to that verbiage
 
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.869 align:start position:0%
can speak to that verbiage
please

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
but if i can just observe it changes the
 
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity thank you
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%

thank you i would have misspelled moro
 
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you no problem
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
um i represent the new england cable and
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
telecommunications association during
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing this morning you heard from
 
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
chris hodgdon from comcast who is a
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
member of our association
 
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
he couldn't be here this afternoon so
 
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'll try to pick up where he left off
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
with some explanation about that
 
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
sentence which was
 
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
very deliberately added into the senate
 
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
version of the bill
 
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is and i think
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
as a lay person i can best explain it
 
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
if comcast has agreed to
 
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
go into community and invest its own
 
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
capital for example
 
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
to deploy to
 
00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 align:start position:0%
say an additional certain number of
 
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
say an additional certain number of
homes

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
a competitor
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
may not know or be aware that comcast is
 
00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.309 align:start position:0%
may not know or be aware that comcast is
actually

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
the gun construction for example
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
the make ready process
 
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
you may not see the wires being strung
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
but the process is underway
 
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
so under this particular initiative
 
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
if i as a competitive provider
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
put an application for a grant
 
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
to go build in that area where comcast
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
is already under construction
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't be eligible
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
for access to those taxpayer dollars
 
00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
to fund essentially an overbuilt
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
where private
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
capital is already being spent
 
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
i have no way of knowing that
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
but comcast of course knows where they
 
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.189 align:start position:0%
but comcast of course knows where they
are

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
so they can say as part of a challenge
 
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.030 align:start position:0%
so they can say as part of a challenge
process

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why this applicant
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be funded
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
and they can demonstrate
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh that they're there that they're
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
providing service or that they will be
 
00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
providing service
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
and that will be
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
a successful challenge
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
of an applicant's eligibility for
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
funding because construction has
 
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.390 align:start position:0%
funding because construction has
commenced

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
commenced
 
00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
so comcast in this example has commenced
 
00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.710 align:start position:0%
so comcast in this example has commenced
construction

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
i'm seeking dollars to build the same
 
00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:15.430 align:start position:0%
i'm seeking dollars to build the same
area

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
not knowing that they're under
 
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.749 align:start position:0%
not knowing that they're under
construction

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's up to comcast to say as part of a
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
challenge process
 
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
they're not eligible for this funding to
 
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.749 align:start position:0%
they're not eligible for this funding to
overbuild

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
yes that's the best explanation i've
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
heard so far thank you
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
i'm giving it my best and i will add
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit tricky because the
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
amendment as you see it is out of
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
context of the of the statute
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
and that makes it a little bit tricky
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
but i'll add to that that in the
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
amended version that came from the
 
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.469 align:start position:0%
amended version that came from the
senate

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
we added
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
that construction has commenced when a
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
provider initiates the make ready
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
process or begins construction of
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
broadband infrastructure in the project
 
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
broadband infrastructure in the project
area

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
the reason for that addition was uh
 
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.710 align:start position:0%
the reason for that addition was uh
specifically

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.990 align:start position:0%
specifically
um

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
certain senators were interested in more
 
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.909 align:start position:0%
certain senators were interested in more
um

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
a morton
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
a definitive
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
explanation as to what construction has
 
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
commenced would mean they thought that
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
that phrase was a little bit vague so
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the addition
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
of that language they were comfortable
 
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.909 align:start position:0%
of that language they were comfortable
that

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
um not only would the providers know
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
when construction has commenced but it
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
would be an appropriate
 
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.590 align:start position:0%
would be an appropriate
um

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
definition guardrail etc
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
what are you reading from
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
i'm reading from senate bill 445 as
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.589 --> 00:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
so and the the whole the whole
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
premise of this
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
to take a step back and look at it from
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
the sort of the big picture
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders generally
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
are working to ensure the highest and
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
best use of taxpayer dollars so that
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
those taxpayer dollars can be invested
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
in areas where there is not service
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
where it's unserved and so this
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
particular provision allows a provider
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
who's already in one area to say we're
 
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.390 align:start position:0%
who's already in one area to say we're
here

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
those taxpayer dollars shouldn't be
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
directed to this particular geographic
 
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.230 align:start position:0%
directed to this particular geographic
location

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
so with that explanation seeing that you
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
got all of that out of this you know i
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
don't think this is worth an amendment i
 
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
myself would not have written that
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
sentence that way
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
but again with your explanation drawing
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
that out of that i'm
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
fine to not tinker with that
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
myself representative
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for your explanation it helped me
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you were there this
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
morning when i asked the question over
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
in peterborough which is an area that
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
has been underserved
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
consolidated came in using
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
federal dollars to oversaturate where
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
comcast already was
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
can you give me an explanation why they
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
hitting an area for the second time when
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
we already get these areas of the state
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
that the 30 000 i think was mentioned
 
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.150 align:start position:0%
that the 30 000 i think was mentioned
sure

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and i think what
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
you highlight is an incredibly important
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
concept here
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a very competitive
 
00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:41.509 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a very competitive
industry

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
the telecom industry isn't isn't is just
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
robustly competitive you have
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
consolidated cci going out and investing
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
where comcast is already serving and in
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
fact with our within our cable
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
association we have breeze line formerly
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
atlantic broadband
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
uh now deploying in for example concord
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
where comcast has been our incumbent
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so even within the cable industry we
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
now have vibrant competition
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
so why would that happen
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh because every one of my clients and
 
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
cci would say the same thing
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to fight for every
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
customer where there is a business case
 
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
to be made to fight for those customers
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
what this program is getting at
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
is the instances where they can't make
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
that business case to go in and invest
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
the in those unserved areas
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
so you know i i can't speak to cci's
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
business plans or their decision making
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
but it's a great example of the robust
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
competition that we see
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
and why we want to keep these dollars
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
these federal dollars focused on
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
the unserved
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
does that mean that
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
let's pick on the concrete example sure
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
comcast has got blind strong or are they
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
responsible for who strung them i don't
 
00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:06.069 align:start position:0%
responsible for who strung them i don't
know

00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
they're operating in now so another
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
company could come in and
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
add additional lines
 
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.829 align:start position:0%
add additional lines
absolutely

00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
so there's a process now i'm not going
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
to pretend to be the technical expert by
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
any stretch
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
but um what i can tell you is atlantic
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
broadband now breeze line
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
went to the city of concord they
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
obtained a franchise agreement to
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
provide video service and also
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
internet broadband service and concord
 
00:10:34.079 --> 00:10:35.910 align:start position:0%
internet broadband service and concord
comcast

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
comcast
 
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
comcast
offers

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
offers
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
similar services
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
consolidated in concord offers similar
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
services so we're very fortunate in
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
concord now we have a choice of multiple
 
00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.030 align:start position:0%
concord now we have a choice of multiple
providers

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
offering us internet access video
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
etc so absolutely there's a process to
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
go through to obtain a competitive
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
franchise there's a process to go
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
through which is the make ready process
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
to access the poles and to string the
 
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:03.430 align:start position:0%
to access the poles and to string the
fiber

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
fiber
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
and who wins the people who own the
 
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.550 align:start position:0%
and who wins the people who own the
polls

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
polls
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
i hope the consumers win right we all
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
want more choices that's true too
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that i can
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
find out
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
yeah there there are a lot of um folks
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
out there right now deploying so i'll
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
find out for you
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone else like to speak to this
 
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.630 align:start position:0%
does anyone else like to speak to this
bill

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
this is a work session so we're happy to
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
work thank you for the opportunity thank
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
well i just want to clear up something
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
a little unsure and i'd look to the lba
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
on this one because right before the
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
meeting we're talking about
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment that has the word
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
am i looking at 445
 
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.150 align:start position:0%
am i looking at 445
a

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
i mean is this already amended
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
or do we need to
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
have our own amendment that says the
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
same thing as this amendment sure
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
researcher so um the amendment that
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
you're looking at that senator senator
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
hennessey brought forth the um 1351 s
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
that was never officially adopted so if
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
you are interested in adding that word
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
successfully we will have to get another
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
amendment drafted in your name if you'd
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
like and that's the one that you will
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
vote on you can vote on it today even
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
though you don't have it in front of you
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and i'll work with ols to get that done
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of today but if you
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
do want to add that work word
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
let me just
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
on line 16 of the basic build
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
you insert the word
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
uh a provider who successfully
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
challenges yeah that's the only
 
00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:22.870 align:start position:0%
challenges yeah that's the only
difference

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
and and i the the subtlety there for me
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
is that anybody could challenge
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
that could
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
gum up the works but they have
 
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:54.550 align:start position:0%
gum up the works but they have
successful

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
well what we're actually voting on is
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
this hennessy amendment with a new name
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
on top yeah
 
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:04.389 align:start position:0%
on top yeah
okay

00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
do you know do you know why
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
the senate didn't act on the uh
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure i think um it was found
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
after that they needed to add that word
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
successfully after it had been voted on
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
on the senate floor uh so then they
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
corrected this but it didn't get caught
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:32.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
amendment moved by representative we
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
have a second
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.269 align:start position:0%
 
clarification

00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.150 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
we're voting on the hennessey amendment
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be renamed
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
it'll be renumbered now
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
i have problems with the procedure i
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
mean we're assuming that nothing's going
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
to go wrong and we're going to get
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
another number so
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's why i was just saying
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
if you like gambling with his money
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm still i'm still not comfortable
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
because i know it's assuming things are
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
okay you got to turn it on
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
