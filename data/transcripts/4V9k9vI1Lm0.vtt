00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
apparently a warrant is much easier to
 
00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:50.470 align:start position:0%
apparently a warrant is much easier to
obtain

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
than a court order so i think that um
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
the concerns with this bill are
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
all right that's representing goalie
 
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.830 align:start position:0%
all right that's representing goalie
seconds

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe we've covered
 
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.149 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe we've covered
everything

00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
under the discussion of the amendment
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative yeah i'd like to
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
say this um
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'm out of step i'm opposed to all of
 
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:43.590 align:start position:0%
i'm out of step i'm opposed to all of
this

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
i think the police should have every a
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
bill ability
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh do what they need to to fight crime
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
because i see no
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is like ned lud at the luddites
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
this is the wave of the future
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
there'll be private concerns facebook
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
whatever will establish
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
this uh we're we're just we're
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
resisting uh what's inevitable
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
and i don't know where society is going
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
but i see it as inevitable
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to cast the feudal protest
 
00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:15.990 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to cast the feudal protest
no

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
vote but i'm happy to lose all right
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh i don't
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
disagree with the thrust that
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
this is probably the wave of the future
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
and that the police need to have
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
the necessary tools to do their job of
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but this bill is not
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
aimed at that
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
it is or intended to thwart that
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
it is aimed at uh what i think is
 
00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
going to be inevitable if we do not have
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
something like that in new hampshire
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
namely that we will have the communi
 
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.190 align:start position:0%
namely that we will have the communi
subdivisions

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh irresistibly drawn toward
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
um toward monitoring
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh general activity of citizens having
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
crime or anything else they're minding
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
their own business
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
walking down the street they're going to
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
get photographed
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that facial
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
recognition is available
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to know uh with some
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
degree of increasing
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
accuracy no who is walking down the
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
street doing nothing illegal but maybe
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it is it's going to be captured
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
we don't want that in the state of new
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that's what this bill is
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
intended to prevent
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schuett thank
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
i just want to say i do agree with
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
that i think this will be one of the
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
tools that
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement needs and particularly
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
we heard in the cases
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
of looking for missing individuals and
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
however we did hear testimony that the
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
technology is
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
really right where it should be at the
 
00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.070 align:start position:0%
really right where it should be at the
moment

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
and so i'm voting against um i'm sorry
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
in favor of
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
bill right now but i think that the
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
technology does need further refinement
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm hoping that we will reach that
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
point soon
 
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:31.710 align:start position:0%

schumer
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i i also agree with
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative scitec except
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
that as technology grows
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
with leaps and bounds it always has to
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
bounce against the constitution
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
as so long as we have a constitution and
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's not amended to allow such things
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
we have to be extremely watchful that
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
technology does not leap ahead of and
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
surpass the constitution
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
if we think about it you know computers
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
are capable of
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
such complex algorithms today that they
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
could probably predict with a
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
degree of accuracy who's likely to
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
commit a crime
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
and if we were to embrace that
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
technology we might
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
alleviate a lot of crime but we'd also
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
put a lot of people in jail for things
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
they hadn't done yet so
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
i just think that as we go forward with
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
new technology we have to balance it
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
against the backstop of the constitution
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
i'd like to add to that that the
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
technology right now
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
is at its weakest and least accurate
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
when dealing with the type of people
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
that would that we want to find
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
as as lost individuals it doesn't deal
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
well with elderly people
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
it doesn't deal well with children
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
it doesn't deal well with with
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
minorities or people of color
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's at its best at identifying young
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
technologists because that's they're the
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
ones who develop the algorithms and it
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
works fine on identifying that
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
so uh i'd say that the concern that we'd
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
be unable to identify missing people is
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
first if you are trying to find a
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
missing person
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
you it and you want to use face
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
recognition technology
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
it'd be you'd have a lot of false
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
positives and false negatives
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
but even so you could use use the
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
positives whether they're true or not
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
to start your investigation you don't
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
have to bring it to court that the
 
00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.750 align:start position:0%
have to bring it to court that the
reason

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
you went to such a place to look for a
 
00:25:39.919 --> 00:25:40.950 align:start position:0%
you went to such a place to look for a
person

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
was because of face technology you had a
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
a clue that they might be there and you
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
went and investigated it the results of
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
the investigation are what would go to
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
court not what triggered it
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative oh i wish you people
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
would stop you're very persuasive it's
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
not worth the time or the vote so let's
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
please move on right representative
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
scitec urges us to proceed to the vote
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair yes representative judy
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
um in any case uh
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
because there are some twins out there
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
they look alike so
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
we have to think about twins boys
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
or girls men or women so
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh because i saw something like that uh
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
in abc
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago one of the twins
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
did something wrong and then the iris
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
the one who didn't do nothing wrong is
 
00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:53.350 align:start position:0%
the one who didn't do nothing wrong is
still

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
well that's definitely of concern
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative schmidt
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think one of the
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be emphasized is we're not just
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
talking to one another we are talking to
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
the people of new hampshire
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
because unlike in the past when
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh minutes of the committee meeting
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
we're very sketchy or non-existent
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
we are on the record in terms of uh
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
the motivations that we have and the the
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that we have the
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
technology and the courts will look at
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
this in the future
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
and and they will have a record of what
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
we meant
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
and not just a supposition and in some
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
cases it will be very important
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
for uh not only the courts but
 
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
not only the people but especially the
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
courts uh to be able to
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
deter to determine that and so what
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
we're saying may seem
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh self-understood but it will be
 
00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.230 align:start position:0%
uh self-understood but it will be
significant

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
for the record thank you
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
massive silence in that case the motion
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass with amendment
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%

representative blackish you have a
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes

i'd like to move uh amendment zero two
 
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.470 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move uh amendment zero two
five

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
all right repeat the bill number please
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
two one eight
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
itinerant vendor vendors yes
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
could we have the amendment number again
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
please 0
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to your
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
emotion representative license
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
i do um it was uh noted that
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know with the two bills two one
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
seven and two one eight one being the
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
um one being the
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
book the itinerant vendors the other one
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
hawker and peddlers
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
um which are closely related but they
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
had a problem where um
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
there were conflicting references so
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
that if one if both bills passed uh they
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh sections of the rsas that had been
 
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.630 align:start position:0%
uh sections of the rsas that had been
repealed

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
and given that they're that close what
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment does is basically combine
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
them uh
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
if we adopt the amendment and then pass
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
218 we would be uh
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
eliminating the state licensing both for
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
itinerant vendors
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
and for hawkers and peddlers so just to
 
00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:11.669 align:start position:0%
and for hawkers and peddlers so just to
simplify

00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
simplify
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
things that that's the point of this
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment if the amendment passes
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
and 218 then i would move later to itl
 
00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.470 align:start position:0%
and 218 then i would move later to itl
217.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
217.
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%

00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
i i understand that the
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
zeal for uh disposing of
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh what seemed to be you know out of
 
00:32:51.919 --> 00:32:52.549 align:start position:0%
uh what seemed to be you know out of
date

00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
and no longer needed members
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
of the uh the statutes
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
however this statute is doing no harm
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's raising a little bit of money and
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
it provides
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
an impediment for casual
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh users
 
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh who may like burglars
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
who are thieves let's put it that way
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
who won't break into your house
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
but if your door's unlocked they'll come
 
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.590 align:start position:0%
but if your door's unlocked they'll come
in

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
this provides a little bit of impediment
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
for people who are not serious
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
people who are uh you know
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
willing to prevent sorry
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
present themselves uh in various
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
different communities
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh to try to sell goods uh
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
i know that they can still be uh
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
still be addressed by local ordinances
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
but this is a slightly
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
enhanced uh hurdle to get over that
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
serious and honest business people will
 
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.389 align:start position:0%
serious and honest business people will
do

00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
and people who are perhaps not so
 
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.990 align:start position:0%
and people who are perhaps not so
serious

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
serious
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
and will feel comfortable
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps going about their business
 
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.030 align:start position:0%
perhaps going about their business
illegally

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
in the community and doing damage to the
 
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.389 align:start position:0%
in the community and doing damage to the
citizenry

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
citizenry
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
before the locality even discovers
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
they're they're out there
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
um so i'm going to be voting against
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
this because
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
the statute was adopted decades ago
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
and it's been serving a useful purpose
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's still there
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie thank
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
i too will oppose this um
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
i think it's more on the purview to have
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
these individuals registered with the
 
00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.230 align:start position:0%
these individuals registered with the
state

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
um when you look at what they are doing
 
00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:45.430 align:start position:0%
um when you look at what they are doing
um

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
and i will read from the bill
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
offered to sell or take orders for
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
merchandise from temporary or transient
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
sales locations within a town
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
or who go from town to town or place to
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
place within a town for such
 
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
purpose for individual towns
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
to keep track of these individuals are
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
they continually moving
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
um i think is a difficult thing to do
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
um i think by being registered with the
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
state the towns can uh
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
look to see whether they are registered
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
or not and
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
take notice from there i think it's
 
00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
important when it's a transient
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
business that it be recorded at the
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
state and not with these each individual
 
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.109 align:start position:0%
state and not with these each individual
town

00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you johnson bailey
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
it seemed to be necessary to put in
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
it that is an exemption so that towns
 
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.150 align:start position:0%
it that is an exemption so that towns
cannot

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
ban candidates for office or people who
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
are collecting signatures for
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
political petitions oh i just have
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's the question political petitions
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
didn't seem i didn't see that
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
it seemed to be candidates for office i
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
was wondering about political petitions
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
i believe it doesn't say so explicitly
 
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.109 align:start position:0%
i believe it doesn't say so explicitly
but

00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh i don't believe that towns can
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
require a license from them
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative allegro i i
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
would uh thank you
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair i would like to address the
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
three objections that i just heard
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh with the counterpoint uh i'll take
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
the last first
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
the idea that a thief for a lack of a
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
shorter term
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
is going to register with the state um
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
it seems to be a moot point and then the
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
next two items that were left
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
were that the bill does no harm and that
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
it raises money
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't seem to me to be likely grounds to
 
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.550 align:start position:0%
don't seem to me to be likely grounds to
um

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
to have a law on the books raising money
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
and doing
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
not criteria for keeping long votes
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representing the seacoast an
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
area that in the summertime is very busy
 
00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:58.790 align:start position:0%
area that in the summertime is very busy
with

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
all sorts of people like this um
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
i am going to vote against this bill and
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
i hope that
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
people will recognize that some areas of
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire are more prone to this
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
activity than others
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you sam roy
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%

you i i have to apparently keep sharing
my

00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
now you're good i appreciate that um so
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
with regard to the question about
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
whether this benefits the towns in
 
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
preparation for their decision
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's a local permit to do this we
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
heard testimony that
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
really nothing is done at the state
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
level um
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
to do any kind of a background check or
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
anything it's simply they take their
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
name and their money
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
um so with the towns have the ability
 
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
to do the same type of thing on a town
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
by town basis
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the police departments have the
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
ability to do background checks
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that these people are
 
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.270 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that these people are
legitimate

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
but the state really is is doing nothing
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
but skimming some money off of the top
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
of this they're not they're not doing
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
anything other than taking the name
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
and and taking the check so i just if
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
if it was doing what is reported
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
um you know putting a safety buffer then
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
i might be in favor but it's not
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's just a collection so i don't see
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
that as a legitimate reason to keep
 
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:36.710 align:start position:0%
keep the statue
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:39.109 align:start position:0%
keep the statue

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
and they stop when they see somebody
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
outside or they knock on the door and
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're trying to
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
sell things like driveway sealants
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
or they say that they have leftover
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
um asphalt and they can put that on your
 
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.349 align:start position:0%
um asphalt and they can put that on your
driveway

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
driveway
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
and um it that they're not
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily the sealants are not always
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
what you might expect them to be
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
so i think this licensing is important
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
because one thing it will do is if
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
somebody reports seeing
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
someone going door to door doing this
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
they can contact the local police and if
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have that license to show
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
then then they have um you can pick them
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
up and they can be charged with that
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
i think it's a protection for homeowners
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
it's particularly a protection for
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
seniors who might
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
understand that this could really not be
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
a good deal
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i basically was
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
iterate what representative fellows just
 
00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
iterate what representative fellows just
said

00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
as a widow who lives alone i actually
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
did have
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
someone come to my door aft shortly
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
after my husband passed away who
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
said that my husband had
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
given him permission to do our driveway
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
i contacted the local police they
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
verified that this gentleman did not
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
have a license
 
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
and actually came and assisted me in
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
shoeing him away from my property and i
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
think particularly for a female who
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
lives alone to be able to
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
verify licensure for someone who comes
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
to your door
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's primary importance to
 
00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:40.069 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's primary importance to
me

00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
an earlier comment was that um
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
there might be people who would come to
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
either you know go go
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
they're not serious they're going to go
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
into a locked door or yeah i mean
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
like the biggest issue is people come to
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
the door
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
checking to make sure nobody is home
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
because you know they don't want it they
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
want to burgle the house but they don't
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
want to do it with someone present
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
i mean that happens today i think it's
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
more often people claiming
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
um to be you know a utility worker or
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
delivery or something like that
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
and the problem is that
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know you're talking about serious
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
people well serious people will get the
 
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.550 align:start position:0%
people well serious people will get the
license

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
um but people who aren't serious aren't
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
going to try and get the license
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
and you know it's not it's not going to
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
stop them from doing it i mean
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
there might be one case but if you see
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
somebody if somebody is doing something
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
suspicious you can still call the police
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
police can still look into what's going
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
on um
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
i really don't see that this having any
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
benefit and all you're doing
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
is you're making life more difficult
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
more expensive for the people who are
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
the serious vendors who are trying to do
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
the right thing
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
um you know assistant secretary of state
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
told us that
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
they had had you know in his memory
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
no enforcement activity no
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
investigations no nothing
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
and in effect they're doing almost
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
nothing and so i really see this as just
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
a small negative maybe a small negative
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
but really a number of value thank you
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
very much following up with
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
dude almost nothing you mean did nothing
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely there is no no nothing
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
happened and in fact
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
what was really discouraging about the
 
00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
what was really discouraging about the
test

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
by deputy
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
secretary of state was that even if the
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
person puts down
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
criminal history in their application
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
it's still approved
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh interesting how this is breaking out
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
philosophy here that's it
 
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and while we give
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns the
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
ability to license um we once again i
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate that these are
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
folks that go
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
from town to town and our transient in
 
00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
from town to town and our transient in
our

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
temporary and transient sales locations
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
so they could be in manchester this
 
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.270 align:start position:0%
so they could be in manchester this
afternoon

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
or this morning hooksett by the
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon and
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
conquered by the evening there's no way
 
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:29.589 align:start position:0%
conquered by the evening there's no way
for

00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to get licensing on
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
these folks i think it's
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
important if we're going to keep track
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
of them when they come into the state
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
that the state that they be registered
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
to track them and that's that's the
 
00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
reasoning i think we have them
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
register with the state is because that
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
is a true possibility
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.870 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
fellows

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
00:43:53.589 --> 00:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair just as a
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up to some of the
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
recent comments if somebody is a legit
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
has a legitimate quality service to
 
00:44:01.599 --> 00:44:02.390 align:start position:0%
has a legitimate quality service to
offer

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
offer
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
and they're working in a rural area like
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
where i live
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
then they would be much better served by
 
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:09.750 align:start position:0%
then they would be much better served by
getting

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
one license with the state than having
 
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
in in a day up here they could easily
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
cover like five or six different
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
communities and they would be much
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
better better served with one license
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
from the state than to try to um
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
work with each town individually also in
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller towns
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
the um the town office
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
isn't even open every day of the week
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
works in vallejo yes i i think that
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
no matter where the sales offer is
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
coming from it's always prudent
 
00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
to check out the quality of the
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
merchandise uh
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
i guess that's uh the short way to say
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
that is buyer beware but more
 
00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:56.630 align:start position:0%
that is buyer beware but more
importantly

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
i think we're treading on some shaky
 
00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.670 align:start position:0%
i think we're treading on some shaky
ground

00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
ground
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
when we assume that just because someone
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
is selling from door to door
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
and is driving on your street that
 
00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.109 align:start position:0%
and is driving on your street that
they're

00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
more inclined to be crooked than uh for
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
instance the people who sold tons and
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
tons of
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
bad concrete to the big dig in
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts i think it's a form of
 
00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.349 align:start position:0%
massachusetts i think it's a form of
prejudice

00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
prejudice
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
i i would suggest that we're on shaky
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
ground assuming
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
that a small business selling from door
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
to door is any
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
more likely to be dishonest than
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
some of the ones that advertise to us
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
first

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to speak
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%

goalie

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
i don't think i need to speak for the
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
motion i think we had enough discussion
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering representative goalie
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
why you think it will result in
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
something other than a nine-nine tie
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
but that's well it's going to bring it
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
to the store if if we
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
go through all the motions manager it'll
 
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
go with no recommendation
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
all right uh so the motion is
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on house bill
 
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.710 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on house bill
218

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
218
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
discussion no all right in that case the
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
by representative schuett seconded by
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
on the motion it's itl yes
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'll just say that um in fact it's going
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
to come to the floor
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
with 218 and
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative lake has stated that his
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
amendment was basically combining the
 
00:54:59.280 --> 00:54:59.589 align:start position:0%
amendment was basically combining the
two

00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
so rather than deal with two different
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
bills we'll deal with both on the one
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
okay represent blackest you should speak
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative schmidt
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
we had a very kind of vehement
 
00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh hearing on hawkers and peddlers about
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
10 years ago and
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
the committee really determined at the
 
00:55:42.799 --> 00:55:43.829 align:start position:0%
the committee really determined at the
time

00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
that we should not mess with the hawkers
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
and peddler statute
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
that this is not something that we want
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
to let loose on our communities
 
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
without licensing and so forth and
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
having a central licensing operation
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
through the state makes sense someplace
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
that the towns can call
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
and find out whether somebody's was is
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
has obtained the necessary license or
 
00:56:08.799 --> 00:56:09.670 align:start position:0%
has obtained the necessary license or
not

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh we should not let our towns be at the
 
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:13.510 align:start position:0%
uh we should not let our towns be at the
mercy

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
mercy
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
of potentially illegal activities
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
legal activities they can get the
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
license and they'll do their job
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
but you know we looked at it then the
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
situation hasn't changed the statute
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any any other just
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%

please thank you
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
um i support this bill because it uh
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
i believe it uh remedies some current
 
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.589 align:start position:0%
i believe it uh remedies some current
failings

00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
failings
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the present structure of
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh i won't go through all of them thank
 
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:21.750 align:start position:0%
uh i won't go through all of them thank
goodness

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
goodness
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
you also say uh but first and foremost
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
is that the government was never
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
intended to intervene in neighborly
 
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.030 align:start position:0%
intended to intervene in neighborly
activities

00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
like cutting hair filing nails and
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
coloring each other's hair
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
second is that i think that the
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and opposition was lacking
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh so this was about um
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
aesthetics and hairdressing without
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
remuneration just to remind everyone
 
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:52.150 align:start position:0%
remuneration just to remind everyone
uh

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of talk uh in testimony
 
00:59:55.119 --> 00:59:55.670 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of talk uh in testimony
uh

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
against this bill about diseases
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
and myths and burning people's hair by
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
putting chemicals in it and such
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
but i never really heard any anything
 
01:00:06.319 --> 01:00:07.030 align:start position:0%
but i never really heard any anything
concrete

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
they were just all threats that we all
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
appear to face
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
so i asked a question about consent
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
what if a consenting adult asks another
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
consenting adult
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
if you'll color my hair and i didn't
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
receive a proper answer
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
so i just made a quick list of a few
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
things that consenting adults can do in
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
this state
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
we can drive each other in cars even
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
though there are
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of automobile debts every year
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
so it's a dangerous activity
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
and there are actually statistics
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
available on it
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
we can buy or offer each other
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
cigarettes even though there are over a
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
thousand cases of
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosed lung cancer in this state
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
every year and hundreds of deaths
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
so there are statistics to say that
 
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
giving someone a cigarette
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
is is dangerous we can have all forms of
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
unprotected sex during which uh
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
stds may be passed some of them
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
disfiguring and summoning
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
some of them fatal so it brings me back
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
to the question
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
if my wheelchair-bound grandmother
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
asked my wife to put a little

this be a class a misdemeanor i think
 
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.390 align:start position:0%
this be a class a misdemeanor i think
we've

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
experienced some great government
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:23.990 align:start position:0%
experienced some great government
overreach

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
overreach
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
in this and so that's why i support the
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
bill to peel back some of
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
some of this government interference
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you dr roy do you wish to comment
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
thank you i would just add that
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
the ability to to help people
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
particularly disadvantaged people who
 
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily afford to go to a
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
professional establishment
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
some people volunteer their time i
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it's a good idea to
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
keep them from being able to do that
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
so as long as people are consenting to
 
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:05.510 align:start position:0%
so as long as people are consenting to
it

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
and are people willing to do it for free
 
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.270 align:start position:0%
and are people willing to do it for free
i

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
think that the government really
 
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
i got a uh a call from a constituent who
 
01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.109 align:start position:0%
i got a uh a call from a constituent who
said

01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
that she was trying to volunteer to get
 
01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.150 align:start position:0%
that she was trying to volunteer to get
haircuts

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
haircuts
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
at a homeless shelter and was told that
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
in fact even a my hairdresser was unable
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
to give free haircuts
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
because because the board
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
felt that that was inappropriate
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:49.039 align:start position:0%
madam chair um i'll just point out that
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
we did have
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh professionals in these fields testify
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
at the hearing
 
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
that many of them do volunteer at
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
such venues either for free or
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
very reduced rates i'm curious if
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
your hairdresser was denied going into a
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
nursing home
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
just because of the covet threat it was
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
not a nursing home
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
she was offering to give free haircuts
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
to children
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
in a local park properly socially
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
distance and wearing a mask
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
no i don't know if perhaps the whoever
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
ran the park
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
felt that it was inappropriate but i
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and shelters and so forth
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
do accept
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
licensed volunteers thank you
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just making sure
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
my mic is on um this is a
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem parents
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
cutting their daughter's son's hair
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
are not prosecuted in the state that's
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
not what county attorneys
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement is involved in
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is to prevent people who
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
know should not be doing this
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
because they don't have any any
 
01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
because they don't have any any
background

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
background
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
haircut will cure itself but fooling
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
around with chemicals
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
is a is a way to be a fool and
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
and and and have a friend for a fool as
 
01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:36.950 align:start position:0%
and and and have a friend for a fool as
well

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
this this is another situation where
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
this zeal to get rid of statutes that
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
are not doing any harm but do some good
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
um you know is biting itself in the butt
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to support this
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
this time or any time it comes up
 
01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't do any good
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
just meddling in an arrangement that
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
works fine right now
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
 
01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.150 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
chair

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
um i want to make the point that
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
i think that this opens the door for
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
people to operate
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
illegal establishments they can
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
they can set up a room to do haircuts
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
and to do
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
all sorts of um treatments on
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
people and not put up a sign
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
and through word of mouth or even over
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
the internet
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
people can become of where aware of this
 
01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
and go to this location
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
and should they get reported and someone
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
comes by to check on them all they need
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
to say is like oh i was just doing it
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
for friends and doing it for free
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
so that's one point and i i did
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
hope i can um some of you may remember
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
that we had testimony
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
from a licensed cosmetologist and he
 
01:06:05.359 --> 01:06:06.069 align:start position:0%
from a licensed cosmetologist and he
told

01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
told
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
us that to provide services for a
 
01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:10.789 align:start position:0%
us that to provide services for a
charity

01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
charity
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
which would be for no remuneration that
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
he can get that you can get well people
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
who are licensed
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
can get a certificate to do this
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
from the licensing board and that
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
charge for that certificate thank you
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%

01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
respond to representative schmidt by
 
01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:46.789 align:start position:0%
respond to representative schmidt by
saying

01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
that i am very strongly against
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
selective enforcement of our laws
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
if it's against the law then it should
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
be prosecuted
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
as when it occurs and not when
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
they think oh well it's just somebody
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
cutting their kid's hair
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
that's that is a recipe for corruption
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
and corruption basically
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
and i am strongly opposed to it and i
 
01:07:16.319 --> 01:07:17.349 align:start position:0%
and i am strongly opposed to it and i
believe

01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
that since representative santa masaso
 
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
is not with us
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
this bill we will come back to it
 
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:29.280 align:start position:0%

01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%

uh relative to the disclosure of
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
information from

01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
there was um agreement as i recall
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
from the assistant secretary of state
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
on this this amendment takes care of two
 
01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.910 align:start position:0%
on this this amendment takes care of two
issues

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
one is it just says the department of
 
01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:30.790 align:start position:0%
one is it just says the department of
corrections

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
it adds the department of corrections
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
shall have access and the key is to a
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
limited set of vital records
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
information importance with the
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
provisions of rsa
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
21 h8 et cetera um
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
and that was and both the uh assistant
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
and the person who was there from the
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
agreed with that change and actually
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
thought it was a good idea
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
they probably would have only gotten
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
certain records anyway but it's better
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
to make that clear
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
ms smarling actually caught two errors
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
in the existing law
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
there were two places if you look at the
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
amendment on line
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
17 and 27 there are two places where
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
it said you know limited data set
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
and uh in the somehow it managed to get
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
through enrolled bill and everything
 
01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.750 align:start position:0%
through enrolled bill and everything
else

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
it was limited date set which makes no
 
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.110 align:start position:0%
it was limited date set which makes no
sense

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
so it just changes those two words from
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:41.740 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:46.630 align:start position:0%
so thank you
[Music]

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank representative

lucas for the explanation on the change
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
to this second amendment because i was
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
going to ask the question
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
why there was a second amendment versus
 
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:15.910 align:start position:0%
why there was a second amendment versus
amendment

01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
zero two eight two so thank you for the
 
01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.590 align:start position:0%
zero two eight two so thank you for the
clarification

clarification
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
welcome it was confusing there were
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
actually i think two other amendments
 
01:12:23.199 --> 01:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
actually i think two other amendments
proposed

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
and this one incorporates all the little
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
details right incorporates them plus the
 
01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:30.709 align:start position:0%
details right incorporates them plus the

all right seeing no uh
 
01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
no discussion the motion is to adopt an
 
01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.070 align:start position:0%
no discussion the motion is to adopt an
amendment

01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
second second okay
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your malcolm i
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
do um
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
basically what this does is it lets the
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office to give
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
a limited set of information that the
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
requires for certain functions um
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
a person for department corrections said
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
that if they didn't get this
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
they would have to pay to go to outside
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
commercial data sources and things of
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
that sense uh nature
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
and i mean that makes no sense in my
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
view so
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
we're giving them access to a limited
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
set of data they need to uh
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
to handle um you know particular things
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
that are necessary
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
i forget some of the examples but uh
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's just basic information how they
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
need to uh
 
01:14:55.270 --> 01:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
yes yes bailey you had a question no i i
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
i assumed
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
it had to do with restitution that was
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
the one of the reasons they need this
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
information yes
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
there are comments questions discussion
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure who was the second on this
 
01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.149 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure who was the second on this
motion

01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative roy thank you
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
any any uh comments no i've embraced
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
everything that uh
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative all right that's very
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
just to fill in the gap i think a couple
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the other examples were having to do
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
with marriage
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is ought to pass with

mission representative roda
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
i will thank you very much um i think
 
01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 230
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
is has good intentions to address the
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
issues that we have surrounded some of
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
the issues that we have surrounding
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
daycare new hampshire
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
however there are a lot of moving parts
 
01:18:36.790 --> 01:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
um i think that there we need some time
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
to put it together
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
in light of the additional
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that we have
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
with all the bills that we'll be hearing
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
on the house so you can as you can see
 
01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
from yesterday things
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
may take longer in some cases than we
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
think and we may be having a lot of
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
health sessions which i think takes away
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
from the time that we have
 
01:18:59.030 --> 01:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
to really focus on this bill and i would
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
like to the committee to
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
um support that motion so that we can
 
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
put something together that we can all
 
01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.510 align:start position:0%
put something together that we can all
be

01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh we can all support okay
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
um she said it very well i'll just add
 
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.070 align:start position:0%
um she said it very well i'll just add
that

01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know there are some good amendments
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
good amendments that we can work from um
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful but i don't think
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
we're at a point of agreement yet
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to add that the department is
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
revising its rules
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
in which many of the requirements for
 
01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.830 align:start position:0%
in which many of the requirements for
these

01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
these people are are
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
instituted rather than in statute and i
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
would very much like to see what the
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
revised rules are
 
01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
and madam chair i'd like to add to that
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
um i know that one of the administration
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
folks that spoke on the bill
 
01:20:02.709 --> 01:20:02.719 align:start position:0%
did say that a year ago maybe covet got
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
in the way
 
01:20:07.510 --> 01:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
but um i personally had concerns i don't
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
think i'm the only one
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
that um i'm not yet sure
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
or not yet confident that the
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
administration official
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
that is in charge of that
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
has the follow through so i hope you're
 
01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.030 align:start position:0%
has the follow through so i hope you're
right

01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
i want you to be right madam chair
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too want to
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
reiterate um
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
that i hope someone from the department
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
is here and the participants listening
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
to this because
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
we did give them a year to put
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh cpr and first aid into rules we know
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
departments have met over the time and
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
rules have been done for certain
 
01:20:48.159 --> 01:20:49.189 align:start position:0%
rules have been done for certain
departments

01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
um they have not yet done it for us and
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
this is the last time we're going to
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
hold out on this and give them the
 
01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:56.950 align:start position:0%
hold out on this and give them the
opportunity

01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
we'll put it in statute if they don't
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
want to move along so i just want to
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
make it clear with these folks that
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
we're watching and we want to make sure
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
this is taken care of
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
hey anyone else representative fellows
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i just want to
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
add that i
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
read the current rules related to
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that um the improvement
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
there can be improvements in that area
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
that would that everybody can get on
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
excellent anyone else
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative does this have to do with
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
the inspection
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
of these places there's something
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
to do with inspection results yes
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
i just this is more philosophy than
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
anything else so bear with me for a
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
minute and a half here
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
my interactions with state government
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
whether i'm a rep or not have always
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
been good
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
i've got wonderful service people try
 
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
they really do i am concerned for
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
i've echoing in my mind is the testimony
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
of inspectors throwing their weight
 
01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
of inspectors throwing their weight
around

01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
that the teaspoon was pointed north
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
instead of pointed south
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know whom to believe whether
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
the offending reportedly offending
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
daycare center was just trumping
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
something up
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh i just don't know who to believe
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm always on guard for people
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
throwing their weight
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
around i don't know if there's any way
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
to prevent that
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
in rule or statute but that's the most
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's a very discouraging prospect for
 
01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:43.830 align:start position:0%
that's a very discouraging prospect for
me

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to put my finger on it

during the recess we had a caucus and
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
we've agreed that the most appropriate
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
would be to end today's session on the
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
high note of having voted out five bills
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
and uh since representative santander
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
sasa will not be joining us for the rest
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%

monday
 
01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
on the public hearings for four bills we
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
will have a full committee work session
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
on on the emergency order bills
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
after the hearings and i hope we will be
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
able to come to some
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable conclusions on those bills
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes representative goalie
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
just a
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
quick question on house bill 218 is that
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
going to go without recommendation i'm
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
just wondering whether
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're writing a split report not yet
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
there's a uh we're not up against a
 
01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
there's a uh we're not up against a
deadline

01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm not gonna i'm not going to send
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
it out
 
01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.550 align:start position:0%
it out
today

01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
at the moment we have not we have had
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
two tie votes so it's
 
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:30.070 align:start position:0%
two tie votes so it's
uh

01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
if those two votes failed what other
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
we can reconsider we can reconsider the
 
01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
we can reconsider we can reconsider the
motion

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
one of the motions because
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know on on 274 i didn't mind sending
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
it out with no recommendation because we
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
really were
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh unable to agree on anything
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
i think that on tues on uh 218 we
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
we will agree even if we end up with a
 
01:34:09.510 --> 01:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
very partisan divide and i would rather
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
have a recommendation
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
than to put out a whole bunch of bills
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
with no recommendation and make us look
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
like they're
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're idiots that's
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
my personal preference so i'm i will not
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
move out on
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
i always forgot to tell representative
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
