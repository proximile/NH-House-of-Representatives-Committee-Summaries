all

all
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%

on behalf of our constituents
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
with everything that's happening whether
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
you're pro-vaccine
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
anti-vaccine whatever side you are
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
whether your republican democrat this
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
comes down to a simple
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
thing and the question we're going to
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
ask ourselves is do we allow
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
what has happened with this pandemic
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
to change our history
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
forever we have
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
as a society always held our personal
 
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.949 align:start position:0%
as a society always held our personal
health

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
and body to be the most sacred of our
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
rights what we do with this
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
the question now before us is are we
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to allow
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
department stores um
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
restaurants taxi cabs to determine
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
what vaccines we have to have
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
to either work there or use their
 
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.590 align:start position:0%
to either work there or use their
facilities

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
now we're dealing with this because of
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
covet 19 but this is not about covert
 
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.990 align:start position:0%
covet 19 but this is not about covert
19.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
19.
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is about any future vaccine
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
that should come down the pike that
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
a certain facility business or whatever
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
decides that they want their employees
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
or their customers to have
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
as new hampshire citizens are clearly
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
telling us
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
that is the decision between them and
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
their doctor
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
so with this amendment i'd like to just
 
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:42.870 align:start position:0%
so with this amendment i'd like to just
briefly

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
go through what we have included and
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
what we have excluded
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
with this amendment we tried to walk a
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
fine line
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
between one side that says no backseats
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
for anyone
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
and another side that says vaccinate
 
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.790 align:start position:0%
and another side that says vaccinate
everybody

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
we dealt with health care workers to
 
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
we dealt with health care workers to
ensure

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
that people that work in long-term care
 
00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.310 align:start position:0%
that people that work in long-term care
facilities

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
that work in hospitals that deal with
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
potentially weakened immune system
 
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.829 align:start position:0%
potentially weakened immune system
patients

00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
or themselves exposed to these type of
 
00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:18.949 align:start position:0%
or themselves exposed to these type of
things

00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
can be mandated by their employer to get
 
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.269 align:start position:0%
can be mandated by their employer to get
vaccines

00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
quite recently over the weekend i spoke
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for the chiefs of the police in
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me fire chiefs and they were
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of this amendment so long as we
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
can include
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
first responders because they much like
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
other healthcare workers are often
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
exposed to bloodborne pathogens and sick
 
00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:44.949 align:start position:0%
exposed to bloodborne pathogens and sick
people

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
so we amended it and we added public
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me first responders so anyone who
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
works for a first
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
responder can also be mandated to get a
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine that is approved
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
we went through the part about schools
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
with children
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
we left all vaccines that are currently
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
mandated we left alone
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
all we did to change that is that any
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
future vaccines
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
that should be administered to our
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
children have to be approved
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
by the legislature currently it's just
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
approved by the head of the department
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
of health and safety
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
well if there's one thing we've learned
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
through this last year and a half
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
is that having one person in charge of
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
what we do where we go
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
when we do it is not a good idea and
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
extending that to what we put into our
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
children's bodies even worse
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
so if a new disease and a new vaccine
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
becomes available
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
it should not be difficult for them to
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
make the case to the legislature that
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea for our children to
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
so we dealt with that we also looked at
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants and businesses how else
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
could they deal with this
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
we specifically put in a ppp
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
uh note in here that says not
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
withstanding anything in this law
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
businesses can continue to mandate that
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
people wear ppe
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
either working or as customers so we
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
left that there
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
we tried to cover every possible base
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day we have to
 
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
answer the question
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
are our citizens correct that their
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
bodies are their bodies
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
and they decide what happens with them
 
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.789 align:start position:0%
and they decide what happens with them
now

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
we've had discussions on other subjects
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
where often the phrase my body my choice
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
is used
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
and some people argue well that's not
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily true and some people argue
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
i hope that the people that argue that
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
it is stand by their principle
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
and continue to extend it to this
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
situation because it truly is
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
your body alone and your choice as to
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not you get a vaccination of
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
any kind
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
furthermore this doesn't only extend to
 
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
furthermore this doesn't only extend to
vaccinations

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
if we allow businesses to decide what
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
people have to do to their body
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
to be employed or to be customers we
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
have to look at other things
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
they say well letting us have the covet
 
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.870 align:start position:0%
they say well letting us have the covet
vaccine

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
is great it makes it a safer workplace
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
well what else makes it a safer
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
workplace what if next time
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
they decide to install bmi you have to
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
meet the government bmi
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you use too much sick
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
time and it costs more for insurance
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
or what if it's smoking or what if it's
 
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.029 align:start position:0%
or what if it's smoking or what if it's
drinking

00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
drinking
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's no limit to what businesses
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
could do to citizens
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
who need a job or a place to shop or to
 
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.390 align:start position:0%
who need a job or a place to shop or to
eat

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
eat
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
we have to draw a line in the sand that
 
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
people their bodies are autonomous and
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
they're not subject to business they're
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
not subject to employment
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
without certain reasonable and limited
 
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.510 align:start position:0%
without certain reasonable and limited
exceptions

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions
 
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about our future and we
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to look at this from a broad
 
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.789 align:start position:0%
have to look at this from a broad
perspective

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you'll support me in
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
thinking about this deeply
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
and understanding that this is not about
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
just covet 19
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
because before the end of the year kobe
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
20 could be out
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
and we'll need a vaccine for that and
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're already talking about boosters
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to need boosters so i'm not
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure about
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
all of you but i do not want target or
 
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
all of you but i do not want target or
walmart

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
walmart
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
deciding when i need to get a booster
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
shot and what i need to have
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
or having to show them proof that i've
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
done it or
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
medical records showing why i can't do
 
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:38.789 align:start position:0%
medical records showing why i can't do
it

00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you president
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'll just add uh two things briefly one
 
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.390 align:start position:0%
i'll just add uh two things briefly one
is

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh addressing the rest of the amendment
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
separate from the vaccine part i think
 
00:19:50.799 --> 00:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
separate from the vaccine part i think
this

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the only thing i'll add on the
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine part is that
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
not that long ago the people of new
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire spoke
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly that they when they uh
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
approved the constitutional amendment to
 
00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:13.830 align:start position:0%
approved the constitutional amendment to
be

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
the first part of the constitution where
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
they said they uh
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know their privacy their private
 
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.350 align:start position:0%
you know their privacy their private
information

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
was so critical to them that they were
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
willing to amend the state constitution
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
to uh to guarantee that and
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
i see a major part of our duty as
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
legislators and the purpose of
 
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.870 align:start position:0%
legislators and the purpose of
government

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
is to protect people's individual rights
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
a right of the people of new hampshire
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will be voting
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
against this amendment
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
i believe businesses are in a free
 
00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:00.390 align:start position:0%
i believe businesses are in a free
market

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
to determine themselves what is best for
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
the interest of their business
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
if those who choose not to work for a
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
business that requires
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
a vaccination so choose to they can go
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
to another place of employment
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
they know the terms and conditions when
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
they go and put their
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
application in for for that place of
 
00:21:19.679 --> 00:21:21.029 align:start position:0%
application in for for that place of
employment

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh another reason why is uh the fact
 
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.310 align:start position:0%
uh another reason why is uh the fact
that

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's going to end up being the
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislature making this
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
determination as to which vaccines are
 
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.310 align:start position:0%
determination as to which vaccines are
applicable

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
i can't go along with that i go along
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
science and the doctors and
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
one other reason i'm i cannot support
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's just uh my biggest issue
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
right now is
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
why this non-germain amendment is here
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
in this committee and not in health and
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the listing back in the
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
doctor for the public hearing
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
health and human services still had
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
plenty of bills to attach a non-germain
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
where this bill this nigerian amendment
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
should have gone to health and human
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
services committee not edna
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
so for that specific reason as well
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
i cannot support this um if they want to
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
bring it back
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
and send it over to health and human
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
services next year um
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
then i believe that's where it should
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
start and go to the floor from there
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i cannot support
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
this and will not vote for it
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will also not be
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
voting for this amendment
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
the covert vaccine is not mandatory and
 
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
people don't want to take it that's up
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
and there's no consequences for that
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
other than
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
taking care of each other as a community
 
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.149 align:start position:0%
taking care of each other as a community
we

00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
are responsible for public health and i
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the legislature is a
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
place to make those decisions
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you fellows
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i can't support
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
um this amendment with the part that
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
we've just been discussing because it
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
can it will devastate some businesses
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
um cruise lines can't operate
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
safely unless they have um information
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
vaccination status of the people who
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
want to go on a cruise
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
there was recently on tv a poll done by
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
unh that said a third of the people are
 
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.310 align:start position:0%
unh that said a third of the people are
not

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea of going to a
 
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.830 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea of going to a
concert

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
concert
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
because obviously because they don't
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
want to sit beside somebody who hasn't
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
been vaccinated and it's not wouldn't be
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
much fun to go to a concert if you have
 
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.870 align:start position:0%
much fun to go to a concert if you have
to

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
wear a mask and keep your mouth shut the
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
whole time
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
so um movie theaters
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
will also be impacted by this and those
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
are just a few examples
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the people who have been vaccinated
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
and want to attend these kinds of events
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
should have the right to do so and
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
their their rights to um
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
operate within the public space is
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
just as important as anybody else's
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i have
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
several issues with the vaccine portion
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
amendment also first
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
i paid special heed when we had the
 
00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:34.630 align:start position:0%
i paid special heed when we had the
hearing

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
that the human rights commission was
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
never consulted even though they were
 
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
included in this as enforcing body
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
particularly the portion that the young
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
lady testified to
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
that uh this is making a protected class
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
of people that's not delineated
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
how can you tell uh who you're
 
00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:00.070 align:start position:0%
how can you tell uh who you're
discriminating

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
discriminating
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
against if you're not even allowed to
 
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
against if you're not even allowed to
ask

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's also one of my own issues with
 
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
that's also one of my own issues with
this

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
could possibly go along with
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
businesses not mandating their employees
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
to show a passport but to not even allow
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
them to
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
ask if an employee has immunity or been
 
00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:24.390 align:start position:0%
ask if an employee has immunity or been
vaccinated

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
how can they then determine who needs to
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
be supplied with
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
ppe if they're not even allowed to ask
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
and according to this language just
 
00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
and according to this language just
asking

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
would put them liable to a misdemeanor
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
to me that's just pretty much outrageous
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
finally i will say that i am
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
sort of resentful that this
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that everyone worked so hard
 
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.669 align:start position:0%
amendment that everyone worked so hard
on

00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
to put a lot of these professions into
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
the position of being licensed
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
is being jeopardized by the addition of
 
00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:02.230 align:start position:0%
is being jeopardized by the addition of
this

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
very controversial portion thank you
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
hello everybody good morning um
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
i don't want to hold up much more of our
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
time with um
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
reiterating what folks have said already
 
00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
today um
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
but um i've looked at all the
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
information the same way
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
i also have to listen to the people um
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
i can't keep up with the emails with the
 
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.909 align:start position:0%
i can't keep up with the emails with the
letters

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
letters
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
and such and i've seen
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
and i've heard stories also of things
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
already happening to
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
businesses and they are being singled
 
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.990 align:start position:0%
businesses and they are being singled
out

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
um so again i'm the people
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
would like me to vote in favor of this
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to bring up some testimony
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
that was submitted
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
last week as well and
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
i'll keep my remarks for now limited to
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
that it's the testimony of dr raymond
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
walston who
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
ostensibly was testifying against this
 
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
ostensibly was testifying against this
amendment

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
and clearly he's all in favor of
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines and that's his
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
professional judgment and that's fine
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
but it was interesting enough to me that
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
i actually went to the
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
youtube video and made a brief
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
transcript of
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
a question that he was asked and his
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
response it can be found
 
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
on that youtube transcript of executive
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
departments administration at four hours
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
and 59 minutes and 25 seconds
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
to 500 12.
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
he was asked a question by a member of
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
the committee not me
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
and the question was and i quote do you
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
or even reasonable for a person of a
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
person or the government to ask another
 
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.990 align:start position:0%
person or the government to ask another
person

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
or to discriminate against those
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
individuals based on your vaccine status
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
or immunity status
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
when it comes to matters of public
 
00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:10.950 align:start position:0%
when it comes to matters of public
accommodation

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
his answer was i think that depends
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
so i would agree with dr norcasm in that
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
you can't globally group people together
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
and so if you say no we're not going to
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
provide services to any one person
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
because they don't have their immune
 
00:28:26.799 --> 00:28:28.789 align:start position:0%
because they don't have their immune
status

00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
status
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
no i think that's wrong so here's a
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
fellow who came in ostensibly
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
testifying for one side but when he was
 
00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
asked to speak
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
directly to the amendment uh his

i guess i kind of look at it as i'm not
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
really sure it's about
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
vaccines or or what it's about it's
 
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.029 align:start position:0%
vaccines or or what it's about it's
about

00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
restricting private business from doing
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
business in
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
in the way that they want to um you know
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
i've been around long enough to know
 
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.510 align:start position:0%
i've been around long enough to know
that

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
um i've been i've applied for jobs that
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
they said you can have this job
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
if you get a haircut and i've had jobs
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
that i've applied to that said
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
you can have this job if you wear a
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
long-sleeve shirt that will cover up
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
your tattoos
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i've applied for jobs that have said
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
you can't wear that particular clothing
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to work here
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
and um and and i always had to accept
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
that as
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
if i want that job um then i have to
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
adhere to their rules whatever it
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
happens to be and if i don't agree with
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
it if i didn't want to get my hair cut
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
um then i had to go and work at a
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
different job and i did that
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think that that's the way
 
00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.789 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think that that's the way
um

00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
live free or die works in new hampshire
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
allow private businesses um to
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
run their businesses the way that they
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
see fit and the
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know so i think this is more
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
about restriction
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
of of trade than it is
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
um vaccines you know i mean we're
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
picking and choosing
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
which things businesses are going to be
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to do so
 
00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
i too am sorry that this has become part
 
00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:28.549 align:start position:0%
i too am sorry that this has become part
of

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
a bill of another sob bill that
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
um that i think a lot of people have
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
worked very hard on
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
and uh has a lot of good uh points to it
 
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.230 align:start position:0%
and uh has a lot of good uh points to it
like

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
like uh senate bill 133 did
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
but um i won't be able to support it if
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
amendment is attached to it
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair uh also i'm not going to
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
vote for for this bill too
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh because i received so many emails
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh from my prostitutes i'm not even
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
receiving one who
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
who talked good about this bill
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
so because of that uh i'm not going to
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
support the bill
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
yes i have a question on the amendment
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
why were measles removed and german
 
00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:36.710 align:start position:0%
why were measles removed and german
measles

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
measles
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
if a pregnant woman is exposed to that
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
and catches
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
that excuse me representative allegro
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
has some data on that
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah apparently that that was a
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
redundancy uh rubiola
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
is regular measles and as you know
 
00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:56.149 align:start position:0%
is regular measles and as you know
rubella

00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
rubella
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
is uh german measles so before it said
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
three kinds of measles for two did that
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
was that clear on that
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh yes i looked that up just before we
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
came in
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
because i had the same question uh so
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's it
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
used to say i think rubiola rubella and
 
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.110 align:start position:0%
used to say i think rubiola rubella and
measles

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
measles
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
but rubio is and that's why
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
the other one was taken out
 
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
i'm unclear now are you saying that
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're both they were they're both
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
removed from the original amendment
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
no rubiella um is in there
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
and rubio is measles so there was no uh
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
cause to say rubio and measles
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
current statute says ruby rubella which
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
is german measles
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
rubiola which is regular measles and the
 
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.909 align:start position:0%
rubiola which is regular measles and the
amendment

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
some of the amendments we were talking
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
about earlier said
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
measles which was redundant and so
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
redundancy was removed
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
is that clear yes thank you
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you again matt chair um just a few
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
quick responses to what i've heard
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
um first of all since business
 
00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
has actually been created the government
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
has been telling
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
business what it can do as far as with
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
human beings businesses argue that
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
we know we know how to run our business
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
best leave us alone
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's okay if we have children working
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
and we said
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
no it's not okay businesses said we know
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
what's best we know what our customers
 
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.230 align:start position:0%
what's best we know what our customers
want

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
we don't want certain people inside of
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
our eating establishments
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
it turns off other people and we said no
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's not okay
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
we have a history of allowing the free
 
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.149 align:start position:0%
we have a history of allowing the free
market

00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
and business to run as it should
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
until and if it impacts individual
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
rights to a statement made earlier about
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
the look free or die new hampshire way
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
live free or die does not mean
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
businesses live free or die it means
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
human beings citizens live free or die
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
so by cutting business loose to do
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
whatever it wants
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
to its citizens is not live free or die
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
live here or die is telling the citizens
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
that we're going to make sure your
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
rights are protected
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
comparing getting an injection into your
 
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.109 align:start position:0%
comparing getting an injection into your
body

00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
alter you
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
comparing it to haircuts and boots or
 
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.069 align:start position:0%
comparing it to haircuts and boots or
uniforms

00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
or or such things um is species
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
at best and finally
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
when you say well if you don't like it
 
00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:52.879 align:start position:0%
go somewhere else
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
where are you going to go when all the
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
businesses require it
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
right now in new hampshire and i've
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
circulated this two
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
large employers have already put their
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
employees on notice
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine or be terminated hence
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
the groundswell of emails
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that's two large employers and when
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
too large do it maybe two more
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
and two more where are you going to work
 
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:20.490 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
want to make their second or third
 
00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
remarks after i make my short remarks
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not talking specifically about
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
section to which we have
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
incidentally another amendment that
 
00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.310 align:start position:0%
incidentally another amendment that
simply

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
stops before we add that in but
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
on the section for the
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh local zoning i mean the uh
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
outdoor dining we got a
 
00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
very late like yesterday comment from
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
and the restaurant association that they
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
on page 5 lines 16
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
that if they have a sewer system they
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
need approval from des for any expansion
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
under this section
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
i thought that it was clear but
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
obviously not
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
that we meant any expansion of
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
number of people served
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
because you know people want to sit
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
outside or they may be
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
spacing tables further out than they
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
used to so there's not as much room
 
00:36:39.839 --> 00:36:40.950 align:start position:0%
used to so there's not as much room
inside

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
inside
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're concerned that if they added a
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
patio it would be considered an
 
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.390 align:start position:0%
patio it would be considered an
expansion

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
and didn't want des approval
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i can't see that that would be
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
necessary but
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
i wanted to bring that to your attention
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about that particular
 
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.990 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about that particular
language

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
well with regard to this last issue uh
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
it it's very unfortunate uh that we are
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh encumbering i even want to say
 
00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.390 align:start position:0%
uh encumbering i even want to say
contaminating

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
contaminating
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
the very good work that this committee
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
did uh
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
especially the subcommittee on the
 
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
underlying senate bill 155
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
where we made a number of improvements
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
both in conjunction with at the request
 
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
both in conjunction with at the request
of

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
businesses and the commission liquor
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
commission and so forth and so on
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we came up with something that uh
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
i think we was quite understandable and
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
was even an
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
improvement on what the senate had sent
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
us unfortunately we've encumbered it as
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
i said contaminated it
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
with this non-german amendment uh which
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
i'm also
 
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
not going to support and thus i can't
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
support the entire
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh amendment um and um
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
so let me raise my points uh with regard
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the non-german amendment
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
um first of all uh i
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
want to begin with associating myself
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
very strongly
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
with representative goalie's uh
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
remarks with regard to this committee
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
being assigned
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
or being targeted if you will with this
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
we are not the policy committee for
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
medical issues
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
we are not the committee of jurisdiction
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
we have no real expertise in this even
 
00:38:41.589 --> 00:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
several firefighters as our committee
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
members who have some medical background
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
that they are undoubtedly going to split
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
along party lines here
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
um so this is
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
completely wrong and as a matter of fact
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
because this
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment has been so
 
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.829 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment has been so
controversial

00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
and we are now getting a new version of
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
the non-german amendment
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
this morning or at least that's when i'm
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
getting it
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we haven't even probably had
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
properly had it and uh the opportunity
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
to to vet
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh and this is just totally not only
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
improper but it's
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
counterproductive in terms of
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
just good prog process um
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
so i i strongly protest the fact that
 
00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:33.990 align:start position:0%
so i i strongly protest the fact that
this

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment is in front of this
 
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.150 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment is in front of this
committee

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
we are not competent to make this call
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
except to recognize that this is such a
 
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
hot potato
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
that we should not be doing it at all in
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
my opinion
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh is point of reference uh but
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
the the underlying thing is and i've
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
received hundreds of emails as well
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in support of uh the
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment but most of them
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
i know addressing an issue which is not
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
really even on the table
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
most of them have spoken to so-called
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
and also mandatory vaccination
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
now the state has long provided
 
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
now the state has long provided
exemptions

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
from medical procedures for people who
 
00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:34.069 align:start position:0%
from medical procedures for people who
are

00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
medically compromised in a way that they
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
can't have that procedure and that's
 
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.430 align:start position:0%
can't have that procedure and that's
appropriate

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
totally appropriate and i support that
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
100 percent
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
i also with some reservations uh
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
but nevertheless support the idea of a
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
philosophical exemptions i'm very
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
troubled by
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
because that basically says i don't like
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
this i don't want this
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that's very
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
good grounds in view of the fact that a
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
lot of the people who have written to me
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
don't really understand what they're
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
or they're basing their opinions on on
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
on information which i think is
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
questionable at the very least
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
but this is but the the bill is actually
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
a false premise
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
because vaccine passports and mandatory
 
00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:26.870 align:start position:0%
because vaccine passports and mandatory
examination

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
examination
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinations are not on the table here
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
and for the people who are watching this
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
and who will be watching this because
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's being recorded and it's going to be
 
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.349 align:start position:0%
it's being recorded and it's going to be
posted

00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
posted
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of new hampshire who
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
are concerned about this have a right to
 
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
understand where we're coming from um
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
and this is a this is a false premise
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh because uh vaccine passports
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
are not on the table i and i
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
i'm not at all sure that we have a good
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
grasp on this committee and what vaccine
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
passports really are
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
we have a concept there's been some
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
discussion of it
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
but not really sufficient um and
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
and the original amendment i'm not sure
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
can find it in this amendment would have
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
banned any documentation
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
regarding vaccinations well i've had the
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
the covid 19 vaccination the pfizer
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine both shots i'm totally protected
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
i had no reactions whatsoever of a
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
negative sort
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
i'm under the information i've received
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
i'm now protected against
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
covert 19 and all of its variants that
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
we know about at this point
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
i'm comfortable with that i'm also
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable with people who
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh who are medically fragile
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
who cannot for one reason or other be
 
00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.470 align:start position:0%
who cannot for one reason or other be
vaccinated

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be vaccinated putting
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
themselves at risk and they're not
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
being required to be vaccinated the
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
hospital association and the doctors
 
00:43:09.359 --> 00:43:09.750 align:start position:0%
hospital association and the doctors
that

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
testified before us they they said
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know they have worker the hospital
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
association testified
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
they have workarounds they are
 
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
enabling people who cannot be vaccinated
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
or for
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
religious reasons perhaps also cannot be
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or won't be vaccinated
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
that they have work around so those
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
people can protect themselves and the
 
00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:38.150 align:start position:0%
people can protect themselves and the
public

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
so so you know
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's mandatory vaccination is in my
 
00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.430 align:start position:0%
that's mandatory vaccination is in my
judgment

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
not really on the table certainly not
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
the way that the
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
supporters of the non-german and maine
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
amendment think
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
it to be the case as far as
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine passports as i say the original
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
amendment from representative baxter
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
you know specifically had the language
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
no any documentation
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
regarding vaccinations well when i got
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
my vaccines
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
they gave me a card they had my name my
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
date of birth
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
the lot number of the vaccine and the
 
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.550 align:start position:0%
the lot number of the vaccine and the
date

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
and when i came back from my for my
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
second shot
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
they entered in the the the date and all
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
the pertinent information as well as the
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
lot number
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
well that would be prohibited under uh
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
the baxter language for sure
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
but that would be a violation of federal
 
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.390 align:start position:0%
but that would be a violation of federal
law

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
the the the there's a record being made
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
of the fact that i've been vaccinated
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
and i can to the degree that it's
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
necessary i can present that car
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
to show that i've been vaccinated
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
that would be prohibited under under the
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
baxter amendment and i think it's
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's in here or not because
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
this new amendment
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
changes from things that no i don't it
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't even been properly vetted
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
so this is you know th this
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
is a a bad amendment because it it
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
demands things that the the so-called
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
threat assessment that has been
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
consistently part of the not only the
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
baxter amendment but right on through
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
including representative roy's that
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
would put
 
00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
the hospitals through you know
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
individual assessment
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
they have thousands and tens of
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
employees who work for medical
 
00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:41.589 align:start position:0%
employees who work for medical
professions

00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
professions
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
medical occupations they would all have
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
to be individually assessed
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
what is that going to cost in time and
 
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.630 align:start position:0%
what is that going to cost in time and
money

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
and to the degree that nursing homes
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
which are initially were not
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
exempted but are subsequently i believe
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
included but who knows what is what's in
 
00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:00.230 align:start position:0%
included but who knows what is what's in
this

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh i believe 11 county nursing homes
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the state of new hampshire would
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
all be
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
under this one way or the other
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
and but they would have to jump through
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
all these hoops as well
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's a 28 age which has never been
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
raised but is a germane issue
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
even if the amendment is non-germane
 
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
the 28a issue and the costs imposed on
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
that is the germain issue namely a 28a
 
00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.630 align:start position:0%
that is the germain issue namely a 28a
issue

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
so this is uh this this this
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is something of a of a red
 
00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.710 align:start position:0%
this bill is something of a of a red
herring

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
herring
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh and i want to specifically object
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
and protest against the very common
 
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
and protest against the very common
assertion

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
assertion
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
in the emails i received that we are
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh with with the with the desire
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
of the medical profession to protect us
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
against this uh pandemic
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
for god's sakes this is a respiratory
 
00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.630 align:start position:0%
for god's sakes this is a respiratory
disease

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
disease
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
if there's anything human beings need to
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
do it is to breathe on a very very
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
frequent basis
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted for more than a minute or
 
00:47:24.079 --> 00:47:26.549 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted for more than a minute or
so

00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore any disease that is a
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
respiratory disease
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
is of significant jeopardy to the people
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
of this state
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
and therefore i believe that businesses
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
have a right to protect themselves
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
their employees and the public
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
in a number of cases not always
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
but many business would have would
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely have a right
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
to protect the public as well as their
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
their employees
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
from uh from the the ravages
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
of coven 19 and it's not just some
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
little flu
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know like disease even the flu
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
back in 1918
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
wound up killing something like 50
 
00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
million people worldwide
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
and millions in this country and this
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic has killed almost 600 000
 
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.750 align:start position:0%
pandemic has killed almost 600 000
americans

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
americans
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
so this is nothing to fool around with
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
and this um this
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment is fooling around
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
with it so
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt
 
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.589 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt
representative

00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and i think
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
what representative schmidt the main
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
points he was saying
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
are somewhat what i wanted to say so i
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
won't reiterate them other than to point
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
um i think that 90 of what
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
was saying i think we can all agree on
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
we don't no one's asking for a passport
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
no one's asking to mandate vaccines for
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
all who
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
would be by age eligible
 
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we disagree on that
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
certainly not on the my my body my
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
choice part
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the point i really do i
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
what's important to my constituents
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
and to me is just how
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
so much of this discussion beyond that
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
is has just had such a negative impact
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
overall in our society but too much of
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
this has started to sound like the
 
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.910 align:start position:0%
this has started to sound like the
scopes

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
scopes
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
monkey trial to a degree and i look
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
forward to the day when we can have
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
bipartisan discussions involving science
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
that aren't political
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
um so i will also be voting against this
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you representative
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
yes i um agree with representative
 
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.549 align:start position:0%
yes i um agree with representative
schmidt

00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's something that we've been saying
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
for well over a year
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
and that is people need to breathe
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing i thought was very
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
interesting was
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard this argument before on
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
another bill that we faced in this
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
committee that was controversial
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
it's not happening in this state and we
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
focus on the specific language vaccine
 
00:50:15.839 --> 00:50:18.790 align:start position:0%
focus on the specific language vaccine
passports

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
the other thing was happening in the
 
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.710 align:start position:0%
the other thing was happening in the
state

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
and this is happening in this state so
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
we need to protect people
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
against a violation of their rights but
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
you don't need to be an expert
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
to see what this is all about and what
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
about this amendment and the way people
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
are coming down on sides
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
and and by the way i'll i'll add no i
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
won't add my own background i'll just
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
leave that be
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
but just looking at the way that this
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
bill was argued debated
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
about the testimony given i noted the
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
usual tactics
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
of witnesses and others unfortunately
 
00:50:58.079 --> 00:50:59.109 align:start position:0%
of witnesses and others unfortunately
characterizing

00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
characterizing
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
data as misinformation or lies
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
false information or implying that a
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
huge volume of messages and this was
 
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
this was implied at our last hearing
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
implying that a huge volume of volume or
 
00:51:13.359 --> 00:51:14.230 align:start position:0%
implying that a huge volume of volume or
messages

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
messages
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh in support were insincere or made out
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
of ignorance
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
when i see the internal contradictions
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
like hyping the development of variance
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
to stoke fear
 
00:51:26.549 --> 00:51:26.559 align:start position:0%
while at the same time mandating a
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine that almost certainly will be
 
00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:28.549 align:start position:0%
vaccine that almost certainly will be
less

00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
active on those same variants and last
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
and most entertaining
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
when i hear people opining about the
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
rights of businesses to conduct their
 
00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:37.990 align:start position:0%
rights of businesses to conduct their
own

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh business without interference from
 
00:51:40.559 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh business without interference from
government

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:41.450 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.349 align:start position:0%
government
[Music]

00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
from a body and individuals
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
on any other given day do that very same
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
thing for a hobby
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
so when i witness an argument written
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
with defamation and
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
so many internal contradictions i don't
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
need to know anything about science or
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
viruses or immunology or pathology
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
which by the way i do to know that
 
00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
this is a good amendment and a necessary
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
measure to protect the rights
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
of citizens of new hampshire yes live
 
00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:16.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:21.270 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will just add
 
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.470 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will just add
that

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
comment that i heard previously about
 
00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:33.200 align:start position:0%
some large corporations in our state
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh beginning to mandate that their
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
employees be vaccinated
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
i would just point out that if we
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
end up passing this and making them all
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
guilty of a misdemeanor for doing that
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh chances are good that they will
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
move their businesses and their jobs out
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
of state
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
because they have the interest of
 
00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.470 align:start position:0%
because they have the interest of
protecting

00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
their workforce um they can't afford
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
to have a large percentage of their
 
00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.150 align:start position:0%
to have a large percentage of their
workforces

00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
workforces
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
decimated by some future pandemic
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry who did you call on you
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
oh i withdraw my comments oh i'm sorry i
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
do want to make one comment because
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
i want people to know this as well that
 
00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:32.470 align:start position:0%
i want people to know this as well that
this

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
um amendment does not
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
allow agents child
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
care agencies child care agencies
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
to require that their employees be
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so that
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
a woman is pregnant who is
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
also schools a pregnant woman could work
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
at a school
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
catch rubella and her fetus would die
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
so i want people to understand that this
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
is a serious thing and i don't
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
this is an issue within this committee
 
00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:09.910 align:start position:0%
this is an issue within this committee
number

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
two um i do think that
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
we have agencies state agencies who have
 
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:18.549 align:start position:0%
we have agencies state agencies who have
expertise

00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
and we trust them with many parts of the
 
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.470 align:start position:0%
and we trust them with many parts of the
state

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason why we can't
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
protect we can't trust the department of
 
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative bailey i've heard
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this that if i was to
 
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:40.549 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this that if i was to
have

00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
a tattoo or a long hair
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
or something like that i'd be
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
prevented from getting a job and that
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
would be okay i could just move on to
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
hospitalized
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
we're not you know i think it's going to
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
be good this summer but i think when we
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
get to the fall we're going to
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
start seeing more cases again
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
well i assume those who had covered when
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
they were vaccinated
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
but i don't know no well
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
no i don't i don't think so because they
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
said fully vaccinated which would mean
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know if you get two shots
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
it was two weeks beyond the two shots
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
well you could have caught it um
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
just before your second shot
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
and not have built the army that the
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
second shot gives you to fight the
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
illness but it would have had to hold it
 
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:52.549 align:start position:0%
illness but it would have had to hold it
off

01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
for more than two weeks because these
 
01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.470 align:start position:0%
for more than two weeks because these
people

01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
didn't present or weren't diagnosed
 
01:04:59.200 --> 01:04:59.910 align:start position:0%
didn't present or weren't diagnosed
until

01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
until
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
two weeks after their second shot look
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the vaccine
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
well i think you know the depending on
 
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
the shot you got i think it's like 96
 
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.670 align:start position:0%
the shot you got i think it's like 96
percent

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
right but but for the second shot you're
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
only like
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
50 something depending on the shot
 
01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
50 something depending on the shot
covered

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
covered
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of a flip of the coin
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
before you get your second shot
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
i know you said fully these are not
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
these are these are people who are two
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
weeks beyond their last
 
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.829 align:start position:0%
weeks beyond their last
shot

01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
170 is a pretty high percent
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
i what concerned me was the fact that
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
there were also nine that were
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
so sick they were hospitalized but i
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
haven't heard
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
any details if it's six percent of the
 
01:05:49.119 --> 01:05:50.230 align:start position:0%
any details if it's six percent of the
people

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
who've been fully vaccinated it's
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
probably way less than six percent
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
if you do the math because how many new
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire have been fully vaccinated
 
01:05:59.200 --> 01:05:59.589 align:start position:0%
hampshire have been fully vaccinated
what

01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
well the other aspect is it depends on
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
what vaccine they got
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
the pfizer and the modern is are up in
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
the mid 90s
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
the j as i understand it is only about
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
60 percent
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know effective which is still
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
pretty good
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
and better than no vaccine but that if
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
that was what they had
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
then then they uh you know
 
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
they're running a risk of still getting
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
it the question is
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
how bad is the case and you're saying
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
that nine of them were hospitalized and
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
one died
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
so that's who knows that's
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
but that's one of the things that the
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
medical people told us
 
01:06:46.870 --> 01:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
no vaccine is 100 effective and
 
01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.069 align:start position:0%
no vaccine is 100 effective and
therefore

01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh the the herd immunity aspects and
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on are all factors in
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
the outcome their caucus has
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
taken quite a while sally
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
yeah we should tell representatives are
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
waiting are we just
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
i just is the recording still running
 
01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.910 align:start position:0%
i just is the recording still running
yes

01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
yeah yes reporting is running throughout
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
this whole thing
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
so it has not stopped running i'm just
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
letting you know i'll know and they're
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
still in caucus
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
i think i think we should shut up and
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
not talk
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
this is not appropriate to waste the
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
public's time
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
listening to this chatter well i just i
 
01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:27.029 align:start position:0%
listening to this chatter well i just i
just

01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
think this is pertinent according to
 
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
wmur website 342
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
000 in new hampshire have been fully
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
vaccinated the percentage of 149 people
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
well within the range
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
4.3 179
 
01:07:57.990 --> 01:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
is four point three percent of what
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
i thought she said 149 it came to
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
whatever it is point zero zero four is
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
what i got oh
 
01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
well point zero zero four is not
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it's four that's four one
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
hundredths point four percent
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah not point four point zero zero four
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's to my point
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
pretty darn good that's well within the
 
01:08:28.159 --> 01:08:29.189 align:start position:0%
pretty darn good that's well within the
uh

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
the range that they said would
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
um we don't want anyone to pass away
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
from this
 
01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
obviously no absolutely not but the
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
the point with uh that amendment was
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
that you would not be able to tell
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
if you're going into a business uh as
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
another client
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
or if you're an employee you know
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
who who should you stay away from even
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
if you've been fully vaccinated
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
if we could work we're still being
 
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.550 align:start position:0%
if we could work we're still being
recorded

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
um damn we should either shut the
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
recording off until they come back or
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
do something to mute everybody i believe
 
01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:17.110 align:start position:0%
do something to mute everybody i believe
uh

01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
it looks like the room well the video
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
just came back on
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i i'm afraid to
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
turn the recording off i believe that i
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know how it gets restored
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
if we were to turn it off okay
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
well i would just i would suggest to my
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
caucus members uh fellow caucus members
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
if you want to have a conversation i
 
01:09:38.159 --> 01:09:38.709 align:start position:0%
if you want to have a conversation i
would

01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
ask that you take it offline amongst
 
01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:41.749 align:start position:0%
ask that you take it offline amongst
yourselves

01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
yourselves
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
point taken thank you so we have the
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
video back in the
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
um committee room but we don't have the
 
01:09:48.159 --> 01:09:49.829 align:start position:0%
um committee room but we don't have the
audio

01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
audio
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%

yes and i'm very sad that we can't

support the committee's work on
 
01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien yes thank you 99
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%

i vote no and you vote no of course of
 
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.189 align:start position:0%
i vote no and you vote no of course of
course

01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's it comes with the territories clerk
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
you always forget your chair
 
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay while we were caucusing i consulted
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
with the clerk
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
this is not a surprise and he assures me
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
that it is possible
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
to put in no recommendation
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
with two ought to pass with amendment
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations rather than an itl or
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
not to pass
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
since that seems to be the sense of the
 
01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.110 align:start position:0%
since that seems to be the sense of the
committee

01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
one party prefers one amendment and the
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
other party prefers the other amendment
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
but we all agree we don't want the bill
 
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:10.550 align:start position:0%
but we all agree we don't want the bill
without

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
any amendment uh i will
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
unless the strong objections from the
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
well it seems to me if we have a
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
non-germane amendment
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
that uh where the motion of ought to
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
pass failed
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh just to be
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
clear if
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
if this goes forward without
 
01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:40.149 align:start position:0%
if this goes forward without
recommendation

01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
it will come before the house with an
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion as it came to us
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
is that not correct that is not correct
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
i i that was one of my concerns because
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
we don't want that
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
i that's what i was speaking to the
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
to paul smith about and he says that it
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
would be perfectly
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have two recommendations
 
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
one by one side and one by the other and
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
therefore we would essentially be
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
debating the the amendments
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
because i can't see anybody that wants
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
to pass the bill as it came to us from
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
the senate representative
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
for the clarification thank you manager
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
yeah and i just wanted to clarify that
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
as well that the
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
motion would be ought to pass and then
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
the amendments would be brought up
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
with the out to pass motion so that
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes there would be no committee
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
amendment but there would be
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
two different recommendations each will
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
be with an amendment
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
okay so other than the general
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
issues alvarez and bully that you you
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
had more to say
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
yes i did and i'm sure i just did while
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
we're on the issue and if we're
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to go with no recommendation i
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
just want to state my
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
disappointment in um i think the
 
01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee did
 
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
real good work and getting some uh
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
things hashed out
 
01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
in the original amendment of senate bill
 
01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.669 align:start position:0%
in the original amendment of senate bill
155

01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
155
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
and it's unfortunate that we're going to
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
go to the floor without recommendation
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
on knowing that the work we did on that
 
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.669 align:start position:0%
on knowing that the work we did on that
amendment

01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
was uh for the good of the people here
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
and i just and disappointed that we
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
the fight for the amendment um
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination amendment
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't go to the floor on its own
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
merits instead of
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
being uh caught up in the work that we
 
01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
being uh caught up in the work that we
did

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's just an unfortunate thing it is
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but i think the uh
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
if the debate will be on the vaccine
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
all right representative schuett uh
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
since you made the motion
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
would you write a report on how to pass
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
i would i would first ask
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
my caucus leader if he would prefer to
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
have his name on the report
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
i would defer to him if he chooses i
 
01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:24.790 align:start position:0%
i would defer to him if he chooses i
will

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
let you fight that out among yourselves
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
together thank you i need that by
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative roy will be writing one
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
sorry i've already sent in the one on
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
133 this is a rather disappointing way
 
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:55.910 align:start position:0%
133 this is a rather disappointing way
to

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
end this session but uh thank you all
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
for your work
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
we have actually gotten a lot of very
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
good work done
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
i don't expect any committee meetings
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
until we
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
deal with budget yes representative
 
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:27.350 align:start position:0%
deal with budget yes representative
schmidt

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
until we have to deal with senate
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
amendments so far
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
the only amendment that i've seen is
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh totally innocuous it's only
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
all right representative schuett yes i
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
was just
 
01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
curious if you had a feeling when we
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
likely to be taking those up
 
01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
according to the speaker it's like we
 
01:16:56.239 --> 01:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
according to the speaker it's like we
might

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
we will probably not take them up the
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
next session where we have to get all
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
the senate bills out
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
but on the 10th we will be taking up the
 
01:17:06.719 --> 01:17:07.669 align:start position:0%
but on the 10th we will be taking up the
concurrences

01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
concurrences
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
and setting up committees of congress
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairs by me
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
i would just like to state
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
that i formed a a
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
friendship with former representative
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
dave danielson when we attended
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
the ncsl conference in los angeles a few
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
years ago
