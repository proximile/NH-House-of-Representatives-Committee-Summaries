00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
I'm using my phone I can't do both at
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure I understand your
 
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.389 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure I understand your
question

00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
either the question
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
yes could you read it to me and uh well
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
I I've looked at it some more and the
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
only thing that I see that's different
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
is they threw in the word causes
 
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.150 align:start position:0%
is they threw in the word causes
unprivileged

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
unprivileged
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
physical and yes um that that would be
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know a a shove um you know up to a
 
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
you know an outright punch in the head
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever um you know um you know
 
00:09:28.829 --> 00:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
unprivileged a hug is not unprivileged
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know uh you know when somebody is
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
hurt uh and and elderly like I said they
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh they uh they suffer the suffer the
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
pain in disability a lot a lot longer
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
than a 20 or 30 year
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
old a follow up Mr chairman a follow up
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so with that being said
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
and I not arguing with you I'm just
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
saying that the section e just States
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
purpos unknowingly causes bodily injury
 
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't that cover it I mean you need an
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I think I think he'll
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
have to uh talk to the sponsor about
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
that when he gets back um you know the
 
00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor is uh your your
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
chair and uh you know I'm sure he could
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
uh give you the reason for
 
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
you night have a question yes thank you
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
chair um thanks for taking my question
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
question you I might have to wait for
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative abis but I was hoping you
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
could give me a rough
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
idea um how many times this happens in
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
our like in our state I just want to
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
know um not you don't have to give me an
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
exact number but I want to know how many
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
times an elder suffers abuse roughly and
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
isn't able to do anything about it do
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
you have any rough figures I don't have
 
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:00.519 align:start position:0%
any figures but I did talk to uh my
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
police chief last year when I introduced
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
this and uh he said uh it it the crime
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
is often reported but uh very often
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
unprosecuted because uh the the the
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
elderly people are afraid of of
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
Retribution and um you know and and
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
right now our statutes uh don't have
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
much uh much teeth as far as the uh the
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
punishment goes and uh so it it like I
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
said it goes It goes unreported or
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
unprosecuted be because they refuse they
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions from
 
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.509 align:start position:0%
you are there any other questions from
the

00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.069 --> 00:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
representative uh my question is isn't
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
this more about physical uh disparity
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
between the two parties like uh for
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
instance if I said that a representative
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
Road's mom wore army boots and she
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
punched me in the
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
nose she's next
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
year she would be guilty of this crime
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm T over 65 and she's you know
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
well younger than 10 years younger than
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
me so it it seems
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
like if we pass this people that aren't
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
prosecuted well there's the 10year
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
difference in there and um you know the
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
the the fact of the matter is uh verbal
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh verbal josting uh should never be be
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
met with physical Force especially on
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
the elderly it shouldn't be met with
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
physical Force at all in society but uh
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
elderly thank you
 
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
that excuse me Mr chairman I see some
 
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
people online don't have their their
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
microphones needed and I'm wondering if
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
maybe that's part of the feedback we're
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
getting you could just ask
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah please put their
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
computers if everyone would uh unmute
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
with the exception
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%

kn has a followup question thank you
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
just one last question do you know um if
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
elder abuse is on the rise in New
 
00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:04.870 align:start position:0%
elder abuse is on the rise in New
Hampshire

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
represa

00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
represa
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me yeah my I I keep
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
buffering here but uh anyway um I don't
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
know uh like I said my police chief said
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
that it's a a crime that uh you know
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
often goes unreported but more often un
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
unprosecuted because they're afraid to
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
to uh to to for any rep for any rep
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
retribution and uh thus we don't have
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
any statistics on it but uh he it is one
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
of the most unreported crimes there is
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
Koopa cine Cooper are you
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
there yes she she has just been promoted
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
to a panelist uh yes can you hear me now
 
00:15:10.389 --> 00:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
I can yes you have two minutes um I'm
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
I'm calling in today on behalf of the
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of criminal
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
defense lawyers to oppose this bill um I
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
would like to unless there's an
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that um is there that I'm
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
unaware of I would just like to point
 
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
out that this bill applies only to first
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
deegree assault
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
um not to simple assault and
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
first-degree assault is punishable by
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
seven and a half to 15 years in the
 
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:36.949 align:start position:0%
seven and a half to 15 years in the
state

00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
prison um this is not a crime that is
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
taken lightly um this is not a crime
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
where people are walking away with
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
probation and fines if you're convicted
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
of first-degree salt you usually go to
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
prison um or if there's some other sort
 
00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
of strange circumstance you're going to
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
be on a long time of
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
supervision um uh I just wanted to state
 
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
that to clarify um but also we oppose
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
this overall because it's really
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um the new section e in this
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill is essentially arbitrary and
 
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.110 align:start position:0%
bill is essentially arbitrary and
somewhat

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
meaningless um it's really no worse to
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
commit a crime against someone if you're
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
11 years younger than them than it is if
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
you're nine years younger than them um
 
00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
and this age qualification creates an
 
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
arbitrary factor that sort of parses out
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
and creates classifications of victims
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
for really no good reason um if you're
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
assaulted and someone purposely causes
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
serious bodily injury to you it is
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
terrible no matter how old you are or
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
how old the person is who did it um I
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
also think this bill is rather agist and
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
promotes some discriminatory stereotypes
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
based on age I think there's many older
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
people who work very hard to discourage
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
being treated like they're weaker or
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
less powerful than those who are younger
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
um in the medical field there's a lot of
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
work being done in that Community to get
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
rid of the kind of agism that this sort
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
of Bill promotes um and I think the
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
legal system should follow suit with
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
that and finally um the biggest reason
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
is that this bill is
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary victims who are purposely
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
assaulted are already covered by section
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
A and um the knowingly mental state here
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
is simply bootstrapping and increased
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
exposure um that would normally follow
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
under second degree second degree
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
assault again a very serious charge um I
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
did actually do a little bit of research
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
that um addresses one of the questions
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm sorry I can't remember who
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
asked it but there was a request for
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
statistics and um the United States
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice Office for victims
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
of crimes um has an information sheet on
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
this and they talk about the fact that
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
um older adults are actually less likely
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
to experience violent victimization than
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
the general population over the age of
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
12 so this bill actually segments out
 
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
and gives extra punishment on behalf of
 
00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
victims who are actually less frequently
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
victimized than the rest of the
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
population and another interesting um
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
and relevant stat I found at the office
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
for victims of crimes is that more than
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
half of violent crime victimizations
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
against people over age 65 involve um
 
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
perpetrators who did not know the victim
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
so that makes it highly unlikely that
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
you know more than 50% of the people
 
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
involved in offenses like this would
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
even know how old the victim was um thus
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
defeating any kind of a um attempt at
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
the bill to discourage crime against the
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
elderly there just wouldn't be any
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
impact in that way so your your two
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
minutes is long
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
coopa I don't see any thank you very
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair and and
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the witness
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
testifying um I think you said a couple
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
of things where this law is
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary that the charge is probably
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
um too grave as first degree assault and
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you have any and I
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
think yeah you said it was
 
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um uh could you just um
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
maybe further elaborate on how this bill
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
could be made uh to be more useful and U
 
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.350 align:start position:0%
could be made uh to be more useful and U
more

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate um thank you for your
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
question representative Newman um I I'm
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
saying it's unnecessary because if you
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
look at the first-degree assault statute
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
um the elements of the crime is that a
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
person purposely causes serious bodily
 
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
injury to another that's in um in
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph a that is exactly the same
 
00:20:12.669 --> 00:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
language that's being said out here
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
purposely causing serious bodily injury
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
so my my point is simply that e is
 
00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
already covered by a so it's
 
00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um and then the knowingly
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
mental state already appears in the
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
second degree assault statute so a
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
knowing mental state means that you know
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
you're doing something but you're not
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily purposely causing the harm
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a lesser mental state it means
 
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
that you you know you're doing something
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
bad but you're not necessarily doing it
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
on purpose to harm the person and you
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
know we set out the first degree versus
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
second degree because those mental
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
States mean that you're doing something
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
that's significantly worse um and this
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
conduct is already covered
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
in our current statutes so that's why it
 
00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.310 align:start position:0%
in our current statutes so that's why it
is

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary thank you U Mr chair um when
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
I first read this bill my opinion was
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
that perhaps this was being offered as a
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh solution for situations where someone
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
has a guardian they're elderly they have
 
00:21:23.149 --> 00:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
a guardian or someone who is in constant
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
control with them and is being abused by
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
them um do you uh think that this bill
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
could be amended to cover that situation
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
if it's not covered in in current
 
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
law um well I think that situation
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
um would already be covered by this
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
current law if someone is purposely
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
harming someone they they have cared for
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
and causing them serious bottle injury
 
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
they can be proed prosecuted under the
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
statute currently and nothing in this
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
amendment um makes it you know has any
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
kind of an element where the person is a
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
caretaker so this applies to the entire
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
population thank you very much thank
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
any thank you very much for your
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I see no additional speakers either

support of the bill was eight and we
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
also had eight people signing in in
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor good morning Mr
 
00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
chair and
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
committee is that that's a go right okay
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yes good all right
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
so uh the intent behind this bill has
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
changed since I first uh introduced it
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh when I first introduced it I was
 
00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
inspired by a law passed by Illinois
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
that was more about anyone
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
violating uh mask ordinances at the
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
state or local level I have since
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
um I have since decided and this is how
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
the bill is written that really what I
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
think is most needed given uh
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
really there aren't many mask mandates
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I that is not a
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
battle I want to fight uh the whether or
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
not we should have um mask mandates Etc
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
it is simply a bill to Target um the
 
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
sort of viral video type incidences you
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
may have seen the take place where
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
someone works and the person who is on
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
the receiving end of say someone's
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
belligerence is simply enforcing their
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
workplace uh policy for anyone entering
 
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.630 align:start position:0%
workplace uh policy for anyone entering
that

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:39.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
workplace uh that may or may not have a
 
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
mask on or may or may not be doing the
 
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
six feet distancing thing and if that
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
person is belligerent about their
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I took what was the big
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
battle and reduced it to Simply hey the
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
employee could be someone who would
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
prefer not to wear a mask uh have views
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
differing than mine on covid but to
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
protect that Frontline person in their
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
place of employment from uh any backlash
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
to just they're doing their job uh this
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
could be a place of business this could
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
be the DMV but any place where there is
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
a workplace policy that an employee must
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
do their job to
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
enforce and someone coming into that
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
place of employment as a
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
customer um or as a member of the public
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
and not working for that place would
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
simply be uh protected by that through
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
this law that um you know some folks
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
might have forgotten a mask that's fine
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
they're not in trouble you know some
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
folks may not have been aware of the
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
policy at this work workplace that's
 
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
fine you know this is simply to protect
 
00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
an employee at a place of employment
 
00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:06.670 align:start position:0%
an employee at a place of employment
from

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
belligerent uh
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
flagrantly um flouting that workplace
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
policy for any members of the public
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
entering that space and not abiding by
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
what that workplace uh policy is um it
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
could be the six feet different
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know distance it could be you know
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
the mask and the six feet whatever that
 
00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
workspace policy is simply a protection
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
for that employee who is just doing
 
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
their job and if someone entering that
 
00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
workplace from a member of the public uh
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
is not happy with that and does
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
something that uh puts that person's
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
health at risk and by violating that
 
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
workplace policy has maybe put that
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
employee um in a conflict they really
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be in to be honest with
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
you so I took what what could have been
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
one of those political battles that uh
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
have become partisan that's actually not
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
what I want this bill to be now at all
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
it is simply a a um
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
clarification and clearly outlining what
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
an employee at at their workplace might
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
be in a position to uh enforce with the
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
members of the public that's all this is
 
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
and that's after lots of conversations
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
with folks in the retail sector and
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
business owners um conversation with law
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement about what's already on the
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
law you know a certain level of this was
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know could be interpreted to be
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
under the existing assault laws but this
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
was specifically worded the way it is
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
because of the um because of Any uh
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
broad public health concerns from a
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic and only to protect someone
 
00:47:13.549 --> 00:47:13.559 align:start position:0%
simply doing what they are supposed to
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
do in their job description and if
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
someone coming into that space doesn't
 
00:47:22.589 --> 00:47:22.599 align:start position:0%
like it but then does the extra step of
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
becoming belligerent or difficult and um
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
blaming that person who's just doing
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
their job that's really all this bill is
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's a good bill and I
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
think it helps
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
clarify um for retailers in particular
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
but also uh nonprofits even in places
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
you know where the government where like
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
the DMV or local governments may have
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
these policies Municipal governments may
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
have these policies and simply
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
to um give a little bit of teeth to the
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
law in favor of that employee regardless
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
of their views on masks or social
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
distancing or even covid they're simply
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
doing their job that's the intent of
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill I think it helps clarify a
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
part of the law around um any Public
 
00:48:19.549 --> 00:48:19.559 align:start position:0%
Health crisis that simply um helps
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
protect that
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
employee from whatever opinion or view
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
belligerently reacting to to someone
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
just on the front lines doing their job
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
and that's the bill couldn't make it
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
tried thank
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
you have a couple of questions
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
representa haa thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
question so somebody under this if this
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
passes somebody is
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
guilty of this crime if they don't
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
follow the recommendations of an
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
employee at a a place of
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
business if it's a healthc care
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation during a state of
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
emergency so I go I fall off my
 
00:49:10.829 --> 00:49:10.839 align:start position:0%
motorcycle this spring I'm in the
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
ER and one of the workers there suggests
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
that I get a vaccine under this if this
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
passes if I do not comply and get a
 
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine would I also be guilty of
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
violating this ordinance
 
00:49:31.549 --> 00:49:31.559 align:start position:0%
or I hope not because that wouldn't
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
actually be something that would infect
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
that employee if that I I believe the
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
way it's worded and I did talk with the
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
bill drafters about this to make sure
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
that uh this wouldn't be something that
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
would cause a difficulty at a health
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
care setting let me double check the
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
wording I would be definitely open to an
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment if you don't think the way
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
that it's worded covers that
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
but to be honest with you that is
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely not the the uh intent or
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill at all if uh you
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
know anything to put any sort of
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties to vaccination or not
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
is not my intent this would simply be
 
00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
for Frontline employees to be protected
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
when they enforce just the policies for
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
entering the work or entering their
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
workspace um I I guess you could make
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
the case that if that workpace required
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
people entering uh to have vaccination
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
maybe but that is definitely not the
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
intent of this at all I don't think
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
anything regarding CDC
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
requirements uh that are currently being
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
addressed by employer policies have
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
anything to do with vaccinations so far
 
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
as I know I've only heard the basics of
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
this keep a six foot of distance uh
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
limit the number of people in a in an
 
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
area and wear a mask uh I would hope
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
that this is not um used to um enforce
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
some policy about vaccination that is
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
definitely not the battle I want to have
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
here but I'm pretty sure it's worded in
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
a way that it wouldn't include that but
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
I am open to amending this if you want
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
to be extra clear but I'm going to read
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
the I'm gonna look at the text again I'm
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that this just looks at an
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
employer policy I would hope Shaws
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
policy you know no this would just be
 
00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
about uh directions for it's here I'm
 
00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
reading the bill in in section
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
onea um you know relaying directions for
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care safety from his or her
 
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
supervisor employer so this is
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
specifically about addressing what the
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
public does and I believe it is worded
 
00:51:55.589 --> 00:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
in a way to not include healthc care
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
providers advice this is simply uh
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
employment duties at a workplace where
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
people are entering their workplace not
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
for health care but to um you know renew
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
their driver's license or buy
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
groceries I'm pretty sure it's worded in
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
a way not to affect uh suggestions from
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
a health care
 
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.390 align:start position:0%
a health care
provider

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
tesman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh let me give you a scenario and see if
 
00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:32.789 align:start position:0%
uh let me give you a scenario and see if
you're

00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
guilty they walk into a local
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
supermarket and just keep walking they
 
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:42.680 align:start position:0%
don't make any comment they have no mask
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
on uh and somebody some employee comes
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
up to
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
him you need to put a mask on and gets R
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
religion about it
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
but the the person who's who's walking
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
in just keeps on walking does not uh say
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
anything to them or do anything would
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
they be guilty in this
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
case um I love good hypotheticals and
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's a great question representative
 
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
testerman good to see you this morning
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
um I don't think so if the employee has
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
conveyed the required policy that that
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
person's required to convey and they're
 
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
not continuing to follow that employee
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh and then I mean customer I don't
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
believe if that person isn't being um
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
compliant in and of themselves by
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
continuing to walk that doesn't that
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be necessarily what this bill
 
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
covers this is simply if someone is
 
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.710 align:start position:0%
covers this is simply if someone is
[Music]

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
um uh flouting
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
that basically taking an extra step of
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
aggression towards the employee if a
 
00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
person's just continuing to walk away I
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't think that's at all
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill question one last question but one
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
a at the end says refuses to comply with
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
another who the actor knows to be and
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that this person walking in
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
would know that that's an employee so
 
00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
they would know they would be and they
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
are refusing to comply when I by just
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
not doing it so doesn't this then make
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
them guilty of the
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
assault I don't think so I don't think
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
anyone objectively would consider
 
00:54:39.069 --> 00:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
walking in a certain
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
direction after hearing the policy from
 
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
the employee at their place of business
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think that anyone would consider
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
that an assault in and of itself I think
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
there are things that the governor has
 
00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
suggested with retailers that maybe do
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
or don't have teeth to them about making
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
a call Toc law enforcement for that I
 
00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
think these things are are that kind of
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
thing is uh between the governor and law
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement and retailers this wouldn't
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
um I think make this would not add any
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
new penalty to the law for someone who's
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
not wearing a mask and simply walking
 
00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:19.559 align:start position:0%
into a place of business away from that
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
employee um no this would this would I
 
00:55:25.029 --> 00:55:25.039 align:start position:0%
would not consider walking away a
 
00:55:25.039 --> 00:55:27.510 align:start position:0%
would not consider walking away a
belligerence

00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
belligerence
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
objectively that would be an agreed upon
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
thing a belligerence would
 
00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
be um getting in someone's face you know
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
closer than six feet without a mask or
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
starting a verbal argument that
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
escalates to someone ripping a mask off
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
or you know that sort of a thing but
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
walking away I think universally is seen
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
as uh not a sign of
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
aggression joh RH
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so uh representative
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
testerman uh his followup was along the
 
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
lines of what my question was going to
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
be but there seems to be um for a lack
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
of better word
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
whw yeah I mean it clearly says on here
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
second degree assault and it and it
 
00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.670 align:start position:0%
second degree assault and it and it
clearly

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
says or refuses to comply it doesn't
 
00:56:22.799 --> 00:56:24.630 align:start position:0%
says or refuses to comply it doesn't
say

00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
um it it doesn't say well it shouldn't
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
matter or that's not what I mean it it
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
clearly is written or refuses to comply
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
so one how would this even go about
 
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
being enforced I I guess that'll be my
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
first question then I'll wait for a
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
followup okay I hear you on the first
 
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
part um on the second part it would be
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
enforced the same way any assault would
 
00:56:49.359 --> 00:56:50.430 align:start position:0%
enforced the same way any assault would
be

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
enforced um you know the person who has
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
been assaulted usually has to contact
 
00:56:59.470 --> 00:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh or the employer in
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
this case also probably would be the
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
person calling law enforcement and then
 
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
the process involving law enforcement
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
would continue per uh usual as usual as
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
an assault would be anyways um good
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
question uh you know I suppose an
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
employer could uh you know call law
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement for help enforcing this
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
policy uh anyway honestly given how the
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
governor has spoken about his own
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
executive orders but that is absolutely
 
00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
not the debate I'm trying to tiptoe into
 
00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
here I'm simply talking about um a
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
direct belligerent act to an employee in
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
a workspace enforcing a policy um you
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
know if an employer wants to call the
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
cops because someone is walking through
 
00:57:55.029 --> 00:57:55.039 align:start position:0%
their place of employment without a mask
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
they can already do that
 
00:58:01.029 --> 00:58:01.039 align:start position:0%
I this law wouldn't change that fact um
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
the teeth behind the uh misdemeanor in
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
this case is specifically about a
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
belligerent uh aggressive act
 
00:58:15.549 --> 00:58:15.559 align:start position:0%
towards uh the employee enforcing this
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
you know I think what you're suggesting
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
and what representative testerman was
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting is something that you know an
 
00:58:24.829 --> 00:58:24.839 align:start position:0%
employer could already call the police
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
about given at least how I've heard the
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
governor speak about these things and
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
that's definitely not a battle I care to
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
enter with this bill so if you think
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
that this gives teeth to that we could
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
def I would be very open to an amendment
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
to clarify the wording around this
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
regarding the um the way that the
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
penalty and the act of aggression is
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
worded but I will say if it helps resure
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
anyone I did vet this wording with law
 
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement and with a former prosecutor
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
to try to make sure that this bill just
 
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:05.480 align:start position:0%
gets to um you know a poor employee
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
who's just doing what their employer
 
00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:08.950 align:start position:0%
who's just doing what their employer
asks

00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
asks
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
around uh Public Health crisis and and
 
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
that interaction between someone with
 
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
the public that is aggressive and
 
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
flouting a public health
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation that's it but um I feel
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
like I'm talking too much
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
I feel like what you're suggesting is
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
something that can already happen and
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
someone could already call law
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement is really the bottom line on
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
that and this bill absolutely shouldn't
 
00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
be worded in a way to add any new teeth
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
to that based on my consultation with a
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
former prosecutor and and some members
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
of the law of law
 
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement followup question thank you
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
so to follow up with that I to to be
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
clear I don't believe that
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
representative testman or myself are
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
suggesting anything I we are simp
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly what it says here so and
 
01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
you had talked about hypothetical so
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
this isn't actually hypothetical this
 
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.390 align:start position:0%
this isn't actually hypothetical this
isn't

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
actual I have a handicap sticker and a
 
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
handicap card for my vehicles and that
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
surprises a lot of people but the reason
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
I have that isn't necessarily anybody's
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
business right there are more than more
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
times than I that I should even have to
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
count if I take it upon myself to use
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to park in one of those
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
spaces people come up to me and they
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
question me and they challenge whether
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
or not I should be part there and they
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
look to see if I should be part there so
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
I'm putting a in a position to have to
 
01:00:43.559 --> 01:00:45.309 align:start position:0%
I'm putting a in a position to have to
explain

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:45.319 align:start position:0%
explain
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
myself making it even more uncomfortable
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
than I already am about the situation so
 
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
with that being said you know there are
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
plenty of plenty of situations where
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
people are not able to wear masks there
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
are some that choose not to and there
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
are some that clearly are not able to so
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
now you're going to put a person it has
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
to now explain again why they're not
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
able to wear this mask according to
 
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
your piece of legislation they would be
 
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
belligerent and now they would I mean
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
how is that going to be if the person's
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
Mental Health on top of everything
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
else first of all I just want to say I'm
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
sorry you have to go through that with
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
your handicap c um thing I I have
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
encountered that with members of my
 
01:01:32.589 --> 01:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
family and you shouldn't have to go
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
through that second of all um so that's
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
just as a human being I wanted to say
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
that um second of all uh you know I
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
guess it depends on the interaction like
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
any assault
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
situation um there is an element of
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
assault that is that might feel
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
subjective uh to
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
someone um but what you're describing in
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
no way shape or form uh is would sound
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
belligerent to me if someone is saying
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
my health care provider says I can't
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
wear a mask and they continue to move
 
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
through the the place of business I
 
01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
can't see that being interpreted as an
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
assault I you know and I'm not a member
 
01:02:23.589 --> 01:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement but I like I said I
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
did vet this language going through
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
multiple potential
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
scenarios and I would hope that is not
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
how this bill is used I can't imagine it
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
would be um but if you think we need to
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
news thank you for taking my question
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
um listening to some of the other
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
questions uh this this morning for you
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that strikes me is
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
that uh um that a lot of the situations
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about are covered
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
under our current assault and
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
trespassing laws um I notice in our
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
trespassing statute uh that that is uh
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
an unclassified misdemeanor so it it's
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
not classified as a or b i noticed that
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
you're asking for uh uh for the
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
particular offense that's outlined in
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
your bill to be a Class B misdemeanor my
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
my question for you is
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
are we better off if we were to go down
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
the road of having a statute like this
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
um of acknowledging uh the other
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
statutes uh and simply requiring that
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
during a or or simply saying that during
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
a public health
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
emergency uh these types of offenses so
 
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh trespassing offenses uh and assault
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
on a person in this situation under a
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
public health emergency should be
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
elevated to a class A misdemeanor
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
would would that address your concern uh
 
01:04:00.279 --> 01:04:02.069 align:start position:0%
would would that address your concern uh
uh

01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
better um I don't know that I definitely
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
spoke with the levels of misdemeanors
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement members and with
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
the former prosecutor and knowing how uh
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
stringent a Class A misdemeanor is in
 
01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.510 align:start position:0%
stringent a Class A misdemeanor is in
New

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.349 align:start position:0%
New
Hampshire

01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
specifically did not want um it to be be
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
elevated to that I I am though drafting
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
an amendment to for
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
consideration uh to drop it to
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
potentially as a as a violation if you
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
think a criminal penalty for any of
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
these aspects that aren't already
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
addressed by assault um I'm open to
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
dropping it to a uh violation if there
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
if yeah I'll just leave it at that I
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
think that over answers your question
 
01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
but um did I did I
 
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
answer I I think you sort of did thank
 
01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.230 align:start position:0%
answer I I think you sort of did thank
you

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Maron thank you Mr
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
for taking our questions I simply uh i'
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
opened my book RSA book to
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
6312 and it's in here twice it was
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
amended and so on in 2015
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
and aren't we all under that and your
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
bill would simply make a carve out for
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
people that are in the health profession
 
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
of some kind and I think that making
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
Couts is a very dangerous precedent to
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
be going down and I think this bill may
 
01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.269 align:start position:0%
be going down and I think this bill may
be

01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
redundant any thoughts um I don't think
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
it's redundant or I wouldn't have if I
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
thought it was redundant of course I
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have written the bill um I have
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
read the statutes of definition around
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
the various
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and felt that the the the
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
way that assault is listed wasn't
 
01:06:16.269 --> 01:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
specific enough um for an
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
employee enforcing a policy around masks
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily I feel like with all due
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
kindness to law
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement um there's a bit of
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
subjectivity to how this has been
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
applied during covid and there have been
 
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:41.640 align:start position:0%
instances um luckily not not so many
 
01:06:44.269 --> 01:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
that have made viral videos but there
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
are enough instances where even owners
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
of these establishments have been
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
confused and to make it clear for the
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
protections of the employees I wouldn't
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
consider that that carve out this is an
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
addition to at least the way the bill is
 
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
worded it would be an additional new uh
 
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that is in application
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
during a um
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic that um you know just protects
 
01:07:15.279 --> 01:07:16.069 align:start position:0%
pandemic that um you know just protects
that

01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
employee from enforcing their workplace
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
policy that's it I there is in no way
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
shape or form meant to be any sort of
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
carve out
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
um really this is simply adding and
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
clarifying what would be considered
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
assaults uh to an employee enforcing
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
policy you guys are smart and asking
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
tough questions bring it I'm happy with
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
this you recognize for a follow question
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
chairman in the RSA laws that are on the
 
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.829 align:start position:0%
chairman in the RSA laws that are on the
books

01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
6312 it talks about class B felony your
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
bill says class B felony not a
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor no it does
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
chair listen one needs to be a question
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
number two we're supposed to we're not
 
01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
supposed to debate the witness uh we we
 
01:08:26.749 --> 01:08:26.759 align:start position:0%
ask questions uh to obtain information
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
we always have healthy debates during
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
the executive session amongst ourselves
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
but it just that I always remind the
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee of that that's
 
01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.950 align:start position:0%
members of the committee of that that's
the

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
policy before you interrupted me I was
 
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
trying to ask I was not interrupting you
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
represent Marson I do have as chairman
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
of the committee I do have the
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
discretion to ask a member to suspend
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
that's not interrupting it's within the
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
rules of procedure it's a parliamentary
 
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
rules allow that to
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
happen May I continue
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
please point of order Mr
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
chairman repres you recognize for point
 
01:09:03.070 --> 01:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
of order um I know it's at the
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
degression a discretion on the chair but
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
I believe this representative has asked
 
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
multiple questions and I've been sitting
 
01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.430 --> 01:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
up represent I'll explain that and I've
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
become an expert on what is and is not a
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
point of order a point of order and this
 
01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
I really hope this last time I have to
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
say this because it's I repeat myself is
 
01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
when a member is challenging the ruling
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the of the
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
chair and that is it if I make a
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
decision on on
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
something that is what it is now if you
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
saw at the beginning of this hearing
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
there was different chairman sitting in
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
the chair so the mere fact that I may
 
01:09:49.229 --> 01:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
have deviated to some extent from the
 
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
rules please accept my apology I mean no
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
disrespect to any of the members apology
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
accepted that was not my intent I did
 
01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
not think that you were a disrespectful
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to with draw your point
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
of Representative Marson you are now
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
recognized for a followup question thank
 
01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
you this is only my second question and
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
my point to the to the uh representative
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
I want to apologize I thought what you
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
had in your bill was a class B felony
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
and I now caught my eye to it's a Class
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
B misdemeanor so with that being said I
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
would withdraw my question thank you I
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and appreciate
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.990 --> 01:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
you to the witness for answering the
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
questions um it appears to me that your
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
intent was probably to um have this law
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
or or this bill address the situation
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
where to prevent an argument between an
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
adult and perhaps a teenage um Frontline
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
worker and that even though that it has
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
a Class B misdemeanor as the uh penalty
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
as in any case I believe under the law
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's uh that that penalty could be pled
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
down to something as low as a violation
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
is that was that your intent when you
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
put forth this
 
01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
bill uh well said representative Newman
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
I would say absolutely the scenario had
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
in mind was about Frontline workers
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
typically low-wage workers you know just
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
as easily by the way could be um an
 
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
older woman to be honest with you
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
typically most of our low-wage jobs in
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
this sector are women
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
um like 80% actually um but that is an
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
EXC excellent point and I do feel that
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
we've put too many Frontline workers in
 
01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
these situations to create these
 
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
difficulties when honestly I bet they do
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
not want to be in that position um and
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
the way you describe the pleading and
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
the discretion of a judge would
 
01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely be um what my intention was
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the bill I mean we could reduce it
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
to a um violation I do think though
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
personally I wrote the Bill this way um
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
after lots of questions with law
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement and a former prosecutor and
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
talking through that just the that uh a
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor in New Hampshire means
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
something very different and is much
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
more hard-hitting than in many states
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
maybe Most states um I would think there
 
01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
possibility and certainly by the viral
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
videos we've all watched that some of
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
these interactions I don't think many of
 
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
those were New Hampshire in all fairness
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
could be quite serious so to have some
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
teeth for those instances would be very
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate um if you think we need to
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
add more discretion with a violation or
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
adding it the way you said it
 
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm open to that but I
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
I trust judges to um use their
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
discretion and experience and what the
 
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
penalty phase of these decisions would
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
be and having the teeth in this bill
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
with a clas be misdemeanor I think is um
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
is a good
 
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
thing thank you for your answer and my
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
intent was only to gather your intent
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and actually the way you
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.159 --> 01:13:59.240 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
night thank you chairman thank you
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot
 
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
of um like we we were trying to
 
01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
understand this so a lot of my
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues were were making hypothetical
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
situations so as I understood this um I
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
have a question based off all these
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situations let's say
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
somebody intentionally comes and coughs
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
in my face like there's words exchanged
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
and then they go over and to intimidate
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
me they go over and sneeze or spit or
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
cough in my face and spitting is already
 
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
kind I think considered an assault but
 
01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with this is is if they
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
did this during a pandemic is there any
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
recourse that I can take if somebody
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
coughs like this currently in my face
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
that I could go report to police and
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
police officers actually carry out
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement on on a crime like
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
that that is an excellent question and
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
that sort of um differentiation is why I
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
felt this bill needed to be written in
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
the first place because that that
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
actually enumerates exactly the sort of
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
thinking I was concerned about um I
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
think the interpretation of someone
 
01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
spitting in one's face is already a
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but the and so that's good
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
enough if that's all that people did or
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
potentially would do during covid that
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
would be fine I we wouldn't need this
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
bill um but someone merely even with a
 
01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
mask on and and getting within three
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
feet two feet one foot um with this um
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
employee who's just doing their job
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
could also catch covid is also a concern
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
so this is specifically to
 
01:15:59.709 --> 01:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
codify that public health concern during
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
pandemics and Public Health crisis is
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
exactly why we need this bill to be able
 
01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.430 align:start position:0%
exactly why we need this bill to be able
to

01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
say um simply getting in a
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
closer um you know into the personal
 
01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
space of someone during covid could be
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
deadly is exactly why I wanted this bill
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
to exist um that still to me is an
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
aggressive act and maybe could be
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
considered assault the way the bill is
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
written I mean the way laws are written
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
without this bill but too much of that
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
is left to
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
discretion this bill is specifically to
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
address that kind of concern where the
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
law is too fuzzy with with what is
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
considered an assault to specifically
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
getting to what the health
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations are today so that was an
 
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair can I have a
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
followup you recognize for a followup
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
question I'm still thank you um
 
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative I'm still a little fuzzy
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
um can you
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
just with with just the shortest answer
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
possible just tell me is there currently
 
01:17:18.910 --> 01:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
a recourse for someone that has been
 
01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
intentionally harassed or coughed on
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
during a pandemic to go seek law enforce
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
M help is there currently a system in
 
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
place I guess one can call law
 
01:17:30.199 --> 01:17:31.350 align:start position:0%
place I guess one can call law
enforcement

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.370 align:start position:0%
enforcement
anyway

01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:32.380 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.669 align:start position:0%
anyway
[Music]

01:17:33.669 --> 01:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
um the definition of
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
assault doesn't cover what you stated
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
specifically you know a cough I don't
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
believe is considered an assault
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
currently so thank you yes you could you
 
01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
know I don't believe that
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that I'm trying to be as simple and
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
short as possible that's the intent of
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is to
 
01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
clarify um what you just suggested so
 
01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
the bill would be needed to do it
 
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Hopper thank you Mr
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative taking my
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
question current uh so tomorrow I go and
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
get a a
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
pedicure and I'm really proud of so I
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
walk into the shop of hords without any
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
shoes what is the current law when the
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
employee says um uh sir you you have to
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
leave the building you're not allowed to
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
interfere without shoes what happens now
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
what is for
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
that I I I'm gonna be honest with you
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm not a lawyer myself so I'm not
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
an expert uh I believe Public Health
 
01:18:58.629 --> 01:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
law covers that but I don't know for
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
sure I'll be honest I'm not an expert on
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
shoeless entry to a grocery store um but
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
congratulations on the
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
pedicure let's try to keep our questions
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
relevant to the bill I'm
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
bden thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um my daughter is
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
a teenage Frontline worker so she's been
 
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
coming up in this conversation she's 14
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
she's a cashier at a grocery store and
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
I've seen a lot of people um in her
 
01:19:36.709 --> 01:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
store without masks on and I've seen
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
them go through her checkout line um and
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
the nature of her job and the lack of
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
cooperation with basic requests about
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
hygiene uh in the store has made it so
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
that we haven't been able to visit my
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
mom my elderly mom for months she has a
 
01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
she's kind of high risk but I just
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
talked to her through the window and the
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
front door so obviously this has been
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
really stressful for our family and I
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't ever want to put my daughter in
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
the position of having to choose between
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
her you know her her first job and her
 
01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
paycheck and um our comfort so we we
 
01:20:08.510 --> 01:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
forego visiting my mom so that uh you
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
know Sophia can keep working on on her
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
goals um so I appreciate this bill but I
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
have a concern um um I'm wondering if
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
there are people who aren't able to
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
comply with requests because of some
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
maybe physical or cognitive
 
01:20:30.669 --> 01:20:30.679 align:start position:0%
limitation um I guess I I don't see any
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that provides
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility in that situation where
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
someone isn't complying and but it's not
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's not due to some um refusal to per
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
to cooperate it's uh really through no
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
fault of their own so I guess my
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
question is are you willing to maybe
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
bring some language back to the
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee an amendment that could
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
address the issue of someone who isn't
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
complying through no fault of their own
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm open to amending this
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
however the committee wants to be honest
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
with you um I think in a situation like
 
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
that and the employee is simply
 
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
enforcing their employer policy that
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
leads to a difficulty I'm not sure this
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
bill would cover that currently but if
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
you think that needs to be a second
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
layer of the bill I'm open to it um I
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
the way that you Ed it I wouldn't see
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
that that would cause the employee to
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
need to enforce anything specifically
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
but again I'm I'm open to uh amending
 
01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
question see no further hands the
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%

01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:07.719 align:start position:0%

honorable committee members my name is
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
Laura Condon I'm from Bedford I'm a
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
volunteer New Hampshire director of
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy with the national vaccine
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
information center and I oppose this
 
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
bill House Bill 493 that seeks to make a
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
criminal out of everyone who chooses not
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
to get get a covid shot and chooses to
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
strengthen their immune systems through
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
a healthy diet good hygiene and other
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
effective lifestyle
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
practices rather than get a CO shot that
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
is still experimental and only approved
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
for emergency use authorization the bill
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
also seeks to make a criminal out of
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
everyone who selects a different
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
medicine say like hydroxy chloroquin for
 
01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
example for reducing covid symptoms upon
 
01:24:19.239 --> 01:24:20.750 align:start position:0%
example for reducing covid symptoms upon
possible

01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
infection other than the experimental
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
covid shots it is truly shocking that
 
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
there is an attempt to criminalize
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
health and medical decision-making and
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
choices and seek to make a criminal out
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
of everyone who might make different
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
medical decisions other than those
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
recommended by DHHS and the CDC during a
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency and Beyond I know
 
01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%

01:24:47.189 --> 01:24:47.199 align:start position:0%

01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:24.830 --> 01:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay remind testim one
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
minute thank you uh salt is a serious
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
crime and one which has no place in a
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
civilized society but peaceful
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
non-compliance is when a person disobeys
 
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
an order without raising their fists or
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
making angry threats and what I'm afraid
 
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
of is that this bill opens the door to
 
01:25:49.950 --> 01:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
first being applied as intended and then
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
later when we're all gone it could be
 
01:25:53.709 --> 01:25:53.719 align:start position:0%
misapplied to people who are simply
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
being peace
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
not obeying the orders of authoritarians
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's really dangerous when the
 
01:26:00.669 --> 01:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
government starts granting itself more
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
power under the justification of a state
 
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.669 align:start position:0%
power under the justification of a state
of

01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
emergency so I just want to be
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and consider that we already
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
have laws that protect against assault
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
assault is bad we don't want bad
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
behavior uh but I'm afraid that this
 
01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
would be applied against people like
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
Rosa Parks who was just disobeying an
 
01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
order to go to the back of the bus she
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
was not assaulting the bus driver but it
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
was disobeying order and I just I I want
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
to just be cautious about expanding
 
01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
State thank you Mr
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
Wen seeing No Hands raised the witness
 
01:26:42.199 --> 01:26:44.950 align:start position:0%
Wen seeing No Hands raised the witness
is

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
PE greetings can can you hear me
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
yes we can okay I will be as brief as
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
possible um almost every word in this
 
01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
problematic it appears the whole purpose
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
is to allow anyone to enforce anything
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
but law with the threat of force by way
 
01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
of governmental penalty for simple
 
01:27:15.510 --> 01:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
non-compliance the scope of government
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
overreach is quite frankly frightening
 
01:27:21.149 --> 01:27:21.159 align:start position:0%
George Orwell himself might have come up
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
with a dystopian concept of public
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
service but it is no place to be in New

the committee HB
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
493 must never see the light of day it's
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
pathological in its design and it is
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
bathed in resentment arrogance and
 
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
deceit this bill must be itl with
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
prejudice if possible thank you Mr chair

01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
the public and I strongly oppose this
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
bill I believe this bill is a violation
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
of my constitutional rights under the
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
current emergency Mass mandate many of
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
us have already been under the threat of
 
01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:31.719 align:start position:0%
harassment threats of physical violence
 
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
and discrimination for not
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
complying adding fines and possibly
 
01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.109 align:start position:0%
complying adding fines and possibly
forcing

01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
forcing
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines is just adding fuel to a fire
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
of civil unrest we're already seeing
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
across the state the state should never
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
have the power to force any medical
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
procedure or medical product on its
 
01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
citizens those of us who have medical or
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
ethical or religious reasons for not
 
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
taking a vaccine or wearing a mask are
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
already the minority we the people of
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should be free to choose
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
what is best for our bodies and not lose
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
our ability to function in society
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
because we choose differently than the
 
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
majority I thank you for letting me
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
speak and I plead with you to vote
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
no thank you Miss Hudson for your
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands raised the
 
01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
witness is excused oh excuse me
 
01:29:25.239 --> 01:29:26.350 align:start position:0%
witness is excused oh excuse me
representative

01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
Muse yes I just had one question um and
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
my question is is where it is exactly in
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
this bill um uh that would force people
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
to uh to get vaccinations or would
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
don't um I it just is such an open ended
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know with the compliance it's
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
pushing compliance so
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
say we turn where the majority does have
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
a vaccine am I not going to be able to
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
get a driver's license am I not going to
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
be able to go get groceries um because
 
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:08.119 align:start position:0%
that is the mass was the beginning and
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
the vaccine will be the next step that
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
is what they are saying the CDC and so
 
01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
on is recommending these things but we
 
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
choose differently the M the small
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
minority of people choose differently
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
but we are going to be discriminated
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
against and this this bill gives power
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
to that for me to and and they're we're
 
01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
speaking about young employees I don't
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
want young employees being harassed I
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
have never treated someone with
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
disrespect in a store when they ask it
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
is again with the medical issue I don't
 
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
want to sit and explain to a 16-year-old
 
01:30:44.109 --> 01:30:44.119 align:start position:0%
that I have medical issues and that's
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
why I must not wear one and I don't need
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
to go in that same direction with the
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine because it is a a snowball
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
effect that this
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
is so a blanket statement for all kinds
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
of things that they want to do and it's
 
01:30:59.719 --> 01:31:00.590 align:start position:0%
of things that they want to do and it's
just

01:31:00.590 --> 01:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:31:03.790 --> 01:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.189 --> 01:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
you seeing No Hands raised I want to
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for a
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%

01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
kinsky thank you very much I
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge for you to oppose this
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
bill failing to wear a mask is not a
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
criminal act there's simply not
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
scientific proof that wearing mask even
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
limits viral transmission we're talking
 
01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
about the everyday masks that regular
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
citizens are wearing these are minute
 
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
minute particles
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
and even the FDA had put out a statement
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
on April 24th of 2020 stating to U the
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and health care providers
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
that the labeling may not say that hold
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
on recommendations against use in a
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
clinical setting where infection or risk
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
level through inhalation exposure is
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
High um they may not state or imply that
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
the product is intended for
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
antimicrobial or antiviral protection or
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
related uses or for infection protection
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
or reduction so even though this is
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
what's What's um implied by masking
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
there's not hardcore scientific data
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
showing that this is even effective so
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
to make this a criminal offense to not
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
Mas is is a is a huge
 
01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:31.870 align:start position:0%
Mas is is a is a huge

committee thank you for the opportunity
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
to testify uh I'm Curtis Barry uh before
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
the committee representing the New
 
01:36:11.790 --> 01:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retail association and it's
 
01:36:13.709 --> 01:36:13.719 align:start position:0%
several hundred members both large and
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
small um I'd like to sum up a few of the
 
01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
the comments um as we know emergency
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
order number 74 requires uh people to
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
wear mass in public spaces where they
 
01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
can't distance
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
consistently that comes along with
 
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the retailers in in
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
our case to inform the uh the customers
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
if they're not wearing a mask to enter
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
that that emergency order requires them
 
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
to do so now subsequent guidance issued
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
by the Attorney General's office um that
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
was requested by us outlines
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um which includes that
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
specific duty of informing the
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
customer um we support the premise of
 
01:36:59.830 --> 01:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
the bill which creates penalties for uh
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
assaulting an employee simply for
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
relaying that information in that
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance that's required by the
 
01:37:08.109 --> 01:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
government the employee could it be
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
elderly as previously cited could be a
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
teenager just simply doing their job
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
enforcing an emergency
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
or thank you Mr Barry uh we have to
 
01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
limit testimony to one minute and your
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
time is expired
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
excuse is Elliot aan Mr chair I I did
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.589 --> 01:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
sorry we're working
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
together no no problem
 
01:37:53.589 --> 01:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
um Mr Barry I'm I'm curious I I know you
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
were you were cut off just as you were
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
kind of getting to a uh getting to a
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
point but it sounds like uh your
 
01:38:02.830 --> 01:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
organization supports the premise of the
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
bill uh but you may have some issues
 
01:38:07.750 --> 01:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
with some particular parts of the bill
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you might be able
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
to outline for us what some of those
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
might be representative M thank you for
 
01:38:15.910 --> 01:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
that yeah I was going to say we support
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
the premise of the bill if the committee
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
wishes to tighten up the language to get
 
01:38:22.990 --> 01:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
at the the very specific intents that
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any specific
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations but I'm happy to to work
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
with the committee on that um so thank
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
you for that question um and Mr chair I
 
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
do have um some information that may
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
respond to both representative balin's
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
question and representative Road's
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
scenarios that she inquired about
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
earlier in the in the
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
hearing I would I would encourage those
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
members to to seek that information on
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you for
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
sure representative Newman your Rec can
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
chairman with your organiz I I not
 
01:39:02.189 --> 01:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with exactly what the
 
01:39:03.830 --> 01:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement is Statewide on the mass
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
mandate but I am familiar with the mass
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
mandate in nashwa and it originally did
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
not it was very difficult to enforce and
 
01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:13.159 align:start position:0%
uh they passed another amendment that
 
01:39:17.950 --> 01:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
said uh no mask no service so so then
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
the it transferred the responsibility
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
kind of to the to the uh
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh realtor in that it was then um
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
unlawful to serve a person without a
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
mask unless they had a medical excuse
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
for not wearing one uh does your
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
organization have any
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
um opinion about how that might affect
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
them yes we have actually very strong
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
opinions um we think it's not
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a government entity to
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
ask a private sector employ employee
 
01:39:57.310 --> 01:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
employee to enforce statutes they're not
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
trained in enforcement not trained in
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
detention not trained in conflict
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
resolution which is why the subsequent
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
guidance from the Attorney General's
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
office relative to emergency order 74
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
was welcome which says in essence uh the
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the store the business relayed through
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
an employee simply has a responsibility
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
to inform the customer um and after that
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
if there's an issue then law enforcement
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
should be should be contacted um our
 
01:40:31.229 --> 01:40:31.239 align:start position:0%
conversations specifically with the city
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%

01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
General's office um were both
 
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:39.560 align:start position:0%

01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
in February of last year during the New
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire primary some citizens were
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
assaulted when they were merely holding
 
01:44:12.030 --> 01:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
signs for their candidates outside of
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
the polling place and people that
 
01:44:18.149 --> 01:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
disagreed with that candidate literally
 
01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:19.639 align:start position:0%
assaulted them went up to them and
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
assaulted them now you know about the
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
case in in Windham that was newsworthy
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
and case and Derry though was not in the
 
01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
news because the victim chose to not
 
01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:30.750 align:start position:0%
news because the victim chose to not
press

01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
press
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
charges so what happened in Windham was
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
quite serious
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
the the victims there were three of them
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh later had to get a restraining order
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
and go to court and the police were
 
01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
there and witnessed the event but they
 
01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
didn't they didn't arrest the man who
 
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
assaulted the victims immediately and
 
01:44:59.830 --> 01:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would give police more uh
 
01:45:05.709 --> 01:45:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
and I'll go back and I'll talk about
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
what happened in Windam in case anybody
 
01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
does not know what happened was there
 
01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
were people holding signs for their
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
candidate at at a tent and a man went in
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
and voted and then when he came back out
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
he walked by them and then backtracked
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
and literally assaulted them seemingly
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
out of the blue to the victims that was
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
how they described it is that they
 
01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:35.719 align:start position:0%
didn't expect that this would happen the
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
man um took
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
a a sign uh that was on a wood holder
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
and hit a young teenage boy with it uh
 
01:45:49.589 --> 01:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
or it was about to hit the young teenage
 
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
boy when one of the other men men
 
01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
holding a sign got in the way but that
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
man got bruises on his face another man
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
attempted to stop the the um assaulter
 
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
and he got injured quite severely and in
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
in a way that I did not see in the news
 
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
and because I went and I and I spoke to
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
the men I know that one of the men I um
 
01:46:16.109 --> 01:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
I knew already from his business in
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
Dairy in my town I buy gas from him I've
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
known him for a long
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
time and I
 
01:46:27.390 --> 01:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
I saw that he had bruises i t I spoke to
 
01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
the other man and that man had a broken
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
a fractured jaw and lost a tooth in the
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
attack and the expense of having to get
 
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
the tooth repaired is quite high it's in
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
the thousands of dollars to get a an
 
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
implant so this these people were
 
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
severely injured
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
and then to find out that they have to
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
do all of the work of getting the
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
restraining order getting lawyers trying
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
to fight this the the the attacker
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't arrested right away he lives AC
 
01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the same neighborhood as one of the
 
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
men that was assaulted he and his family
 
01:47:08.830 --> 01:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
were frightened by that uh
 
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
situation um so I I looked at what state
 
01:47:16.350 --> 01:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
laws we have right now for uh pole
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
workers and I simply added campaign
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
worker to pole worker now with a c
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
campaign work I know it sounds like
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
somebody who's making money from the
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
campaign but this would also this of
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
course includes volunteers that are
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
simply holding a sign for their
 
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
candidates I never mentioned here what
 
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
side these people were on because that
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
is not that's not important that's not
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
relevant we need to have a a a situation
 
01:47:46.109 --> 01:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
in our state where people feel
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable holding signs for their
 
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
candidates this is a free speech issue
 
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
and they need to be able to hold signs
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
for their candidates or if they are the
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
candidate and feel confident that they
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
will be um safe at the
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
polls you know
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
when there was a young person involved
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
there was a teenage boy involved here
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
who was much smaller than than the
 
01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:11.149 align:start position:0%
who was much smaller than than the
attacker

01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
and I I myself in the past have gone to
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
the polls without being certain about
 
01:48:20.229 --> 01:48:20.239 align:start position:0%
all of the the candidates that were on
 
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
the ballot but I also knew that what I
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
do when I got to the polls was speak to
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
the people holding signs that would be e
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
the candidate or someone who supported
 
01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
the candidate and I could ask them
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions about the candidate where they
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
stand what the issues are that are
 
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
important to them so when I have not had
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
the opportunity throughout the campaign
 
01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:42.679 align:start position:0%
to learn more about candidates that's
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
how I have done it and that opportunity
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
should not be taken away from our New
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens so that they can do
 
01:48:53.709 --> 01:48:53.719 align:start position:0%
the same thing and if we if we pass this
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
bill that will make people who are
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
campaigning at the polling place safer
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
and it will allow the police to have
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
more um another tool in their tool belt
 
01:49:05.709 --> 01:49:05.719 align:start position:0%
to address this Ser very serious
 
01:49:08.109 --> 01:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
situation I'm I'm glad that nobody was
 
01:49:10.589 --> 01:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
hurt more than they
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
were so are there I I think that's
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
everything are there questions I hope I
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
all representative for
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm are you aware
 
01:49:33.149 --> 01:49:33.159 align:start position:0%
that we have laws against first degree
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
second degree and simple assault in the
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
state why is this uh law
 
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you yes we we are but
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
this was a situation that was witnessed
 
01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
by police and the man was not arrested
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
he was he left and he left the polling
 
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
place went home and wasn't arrested for
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
days later
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
why did we I would go back and ask why
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
did we create this these laws originally
 
01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:00.390 align:start position:0%
did we create this these laws originally
to

01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
protect uh c um poll workers okay people
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
that are work this this simply adds
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
campaign workers to election workers in
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
our uh laws and why do we have those
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
such laws and that would be to protect
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
the people that are working at the
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
polling place so that they can do their
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
job and
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
and our elections are safe and our
 
01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
Citizens Trust that they are safe and
 
01:50:29.149 --> 01:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
that when they go to the polls that they
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
will be safe and I think the same thing
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
applies for people that want to hold a
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
sign for their candidate and again not
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
concerned with what side it is they
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
Democrats Republicans Libertarians
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
vegetarians I don't care I think that
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
they all should feel safe going to the
 
01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
signs thank you any more questions
 
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:54.270 align:start position:0%
signs thank you any more questions
representative

01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:57.800 align:start position:0%
to the witness for answering the
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
questions um the issue you just brought
 
01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
up whether it should apply or not to a
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
citizen who is simply holding a sign and
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
and may not um be associated in any way
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
with the campaign you'd like to broaden
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
it to that it sounded like that's what
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
you said is is that correct and would
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
you recommend an amendment to do
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you I would be okay with such
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
an amendment but I do like to keep
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
things simple so that they that they uh
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm I'm fine with either
 
01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
one and it's depends on if the committee
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
feels that way right now it does say
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
campaign work so it would be someone
 
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
holding a campaign sign so perhaps the
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
my wording with when I said vegetarian
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually apply but but I would
 
01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
be I would be accepting of that the if
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
the committee feels that's
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
important representative Newman you
 
01:51:53.189 --> 01:51:53.199 align:start position:0%
recognize for a followup
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:10.719 --> 01:52:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
night thank you um chair and thank you
 
01:52:19.270 --> 01:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
and um I understand your intent but my
 
01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:23.350 align:start position:0%
and um I understand your intent but my
uh

01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
colleague representative bordon asked um
 
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
you know if this was already
 
01:52:31.069 --> 01:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
covered um this kind of protection was
 
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
already covered already in our state
 
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
laws so my question uh is as I'm a
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
little confused bear with
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
me does election procedure or campaign
 
01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
law is it is it different like we have
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
different rules in our body
 
01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
legislation so state laws don't
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply like they're different
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
when we're in we're in a body is it
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
different similarly here is that why
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
needed thank you for your
 
01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
question the there
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
are enhanced penalties for if a person
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
is attacked while working as an election
 
01:53:16.149 --> 01:53:16.159 align:start position:0%
worker so if you're working at the
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
polling place and you're say the
 
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
supervisor supervisor of the checklist
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
or you're the the town moderator there
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
are enhanced penalties in place that
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
protect you and these this would simply
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
extend those same uh laws to people who
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
are campaign
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
workers that is how it is phrased here
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
but it it would include a person holding
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
a sign for a campaign and I so that's
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
why I think this is a free speech issue
 
01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
and when I found out that the people who
 
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
had been involved in the Windham case um
 
01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
had to do so much work to advocate for
 
01:53:53.790 --> 01:53:53.800 align:start position:0%
themselves elves after the fact and when
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
the man had a fractured jaw and is now
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the expenses of thousands and
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to get a dental
 
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:04.280 align:start position:0%
implant to replace the tooth that he
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
lost that's
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
just I was just um amazed and so I
 
01:54:13.109 --> 01:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
thought that this was the simplest way
 
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
to enance penalties for people that do
 
01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
such a thing and um protect members of
 
01:54:21.229 --> 01:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
the public who want to hold signs at the
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
yes follow oh chair sorry Mr chairman
 
01:54:32.830 --> 01:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you um chairman and
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative So
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
currently this man this victim he
 
01:54:44.589 --> 01:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the assaulter to pay for
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
these damages or he couldn't get any
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
sort of restitution because there's no
 
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
law in place to protect
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
campaign workers or
 
01:54:57.790 --> 01:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers well I think that may be
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
coming later he may find out more about
 
01:55:02.430 --> 01:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
that later as the court case goes
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
through the system
 
01:55:07.990 --> 01:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
but because the charges were there were
 
01:55:11.229 --> 01:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor and like I said the police
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
off the police officer saw it happen
 
01:55:16.069 --> 01:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
there wasn't much he could do for some
 
01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
reason the man was not even arrested and
 
01:55:20.069 --> 01:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
he was let go and it was days before the
 
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
man was arrested now if we had this law
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
in place it would be obvious that it was
 
01:55:28.189 --> 01:55:28.199 align:start position:0%
as serious as a of a crime as it
 
01:55:32.069 --> 01:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
is Chairman can I ask one more
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
question you
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
recognize thank you so much do you
 
01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
believe that this might be a police
 
01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:42.679 align:start position:0%
protocol issue and not a simple a law
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
issue if the police were not uh you know
 
01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
following a law that protects our
 
01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
residents from assault already
 
01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kin Knight I
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
think that's a good question but I think
 
01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
that this bill will make it like I said
 
01:56:01.550 --> 01:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
earlier obvious to all and that would
 
01:56:03.550 --> 01:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
include all police officers that this is
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
a very serious crime and should be
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
treated as such just as we would treated
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
that way if it were uh up the town
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:56:20.109 --> 01:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
M yes thank you for taking my question
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
um earlier you framed this also as being
 
01:56:25.510 --> 01:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
a free speech issue and so I guess my
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
question for you is is uh was the man
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
who committed the assault um acting on
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
the part of the state in any
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
way I'm not sure what his motivation was
 
01:56:38.669 --> 01:56:38.679 align:start position:0%
I have not heard him explain what his
 
01:56:41.069 --> 01:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
motivation was so that's unknown at this
 
01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:45.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:47.830 align:start position:0%

419 FN to me it seems like a common
 
01:57:42.310 --> 01:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
sense um piece of
 
01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.910 align:start position:0%
sense um piece of
legislation

01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:46.719 align:start position:0%
that for that matter anybody at the
 
01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:49.719 align:start position:0%
polling place should feel they're safe
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
from being assaulted in in ser certainly
 
01:57:55.870 --> 01:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
it at some point we recognized that we
 
01:57:58.550 --> 01:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
need to put it in Statue to protect
 
01:58:00.910 --> 01:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
people um working in the polling places
 
01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:05.320 align:start position:0%
from the town city or or a ward officer
 
01:58:08.669 --> 01:58:08.679 align:start position:0%
um I would uh suggest that a campaign
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
worker at the Poland place should be
 
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
protected as well um and it's it's that
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
simple it adds it adds a um a campaign
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
work at a polling place um I personally
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
had um was attacked last um February
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
11th the presidential primary election I
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
was holding a campaign sign for a
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
candidate in Derry at the polling place
 
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
at Calvary Bible Church which is 145
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Road and a a person coming in
 
01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:44.109 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Road and a a person coming in
to

01:58:44.109 --> 01:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:58:47.830 --> 01:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
vote shoved me now I didn't press
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
charges but it was it was simply it was
 
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
unprovoked um that person just I mean I
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't expecting it um it didn't knock
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
me down I have pretty good balance but
 
01:59:06.270 --> 01:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
it would come out of nowhere and I did
 
01:59:10.870 --> 01:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
um uh ask the da police they weren't
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
there at the time they came over and I
 
01:59:14.589 --> 01:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
gave them some information I chose not
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
to press charges and that's really not
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
the issue the issue is you you shouldn't
 
01:59:23.589 --> 01:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
be um feel threatened at at a polling
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
place when you're exercising your First
 
01:59:28.910 --> 01:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment right um whether you'd be
 
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
working uh as a campaign uh worker or or
 
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
again is a is a a worker that's
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
participating to to
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
um help the process of getting people in
 
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
and out of the polling place voting so
 
01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
um I would just suggest that um I don't
 
01:59:51.069 --> 01:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
see any downside to passing this
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
legislation um many of you probably know
 
01:59:57.030 --> 01:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire assault can be as
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
simple as and as a definition for
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
unprivileged contact and this clearly
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
went to that level it was it was above
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
just touching it was was a it was a push
 
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:08.560 align:start position:0%
and it was a punch and a push I guess is
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
how I best describe it so anyway I hope
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
you consider the OTP of the um of this
 
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:17.800 align:start position:0%
bill and um I would just add one last
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
thing um I think we all know that a
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
polling place these these days can be a
 
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
place of uh of a lot of tension where
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
people's emotions run high so people
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
potentially more risk of of having these
 
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
sort of things happen than some other
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
places I would suggest yes but anyway
 
02:00:39.709 --> 02:00:39.719 align:start position:0%
with that I would be U you know it's
 
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
pretty simple legislation I hope you
 
02:00:43.629 --> 02:00:43.639 align:start position:0%
consider it and and uh at that I would
 
02:00:44.950 --> 02:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
be glad to take any questions that the
 
02:00:47.629 --> 02:00:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
hi thank you thank you H representative
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
toosan it's really nice to hear your
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
voice um and uh yeah thank you for
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill I so you called the
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
police and they came and they offered
 
02:01:11.950 --> 02:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
you the ability to press charges and
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
document your assault so my question is
 
02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
how would this law protect you more than
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
02:01:26.189 --> 02:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
question and um as I mentioned I I
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
elected not to to go down that road of
 
02:01:32.069 --> 02:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
pressing charges um the the police did
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
not witness the event there were
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
witnesses that did I don't know whether
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
I would have been successful pressing
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
charges or not um I will would tell you
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
that there was not a lot of interest in
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement wanted to get involved
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
in in the issue and I wasn't pushing it
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
I wasn't pursuing it so um I don't know
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
whether I would have been successful
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
with that or not certainly I this will
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislation of passed I think would
 
02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
enhance um the penalty and um whether or
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
not that would make it easier to to
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
press charges I can't say but it's it
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
may me people think twice um if it's a
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
more serious um uh penalty than is
 
02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
currently there people may think twice
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
before they they assault somebody again
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question no problem
 
02:02:17.470 --> 02:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
follow sir you recognized for a followup
 
02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
question thanks chair and thank you
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative toosan so
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying that if this were to pass
 
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
it add it would offer more protection to
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
people at polls than we already have on
 
02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.109 align:start position:0%
people at polls than we already have on
the

02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
books that's correct if if you look at
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
the language it it it it under um RSA
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
659 colon 41 assault Etc it it it add
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%

02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
campaign working the same um class of
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%

Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
do you know if the uh the phrase
 
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
campaign worker is defined in the law
 
02:03:32.430 --> 02:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
be thank you for the question
 
02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know the answer
 
02:03:39.310 --> 02:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
to that I don't know campaign workers is
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
defined specifically in other stat areas
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
of statue I don't know that I'm not an
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
attorney um but looking at the language
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
it it looks to me you know reading the
 
02:03:51.549 --> 02:03:51.559 align:start position:0%
bill and again I'm not a co-sponsor um
 
02:03:56.229 --> 02:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
but by simply testifying behalf of of in
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill um if you look at the
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
language campaign worker to poem place
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
it seems kind of a pretty common uh easy
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
to understand term uh but it the legal
 
02:04:09.430 --> 02:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
aspect of that definition I couldn't
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative seeing No Hands
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
raised representative isus
 
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:25.719 align:start position:0%
thank you have a good day sh I
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
Cooper um thank you Mr chairman and
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee this is
 
02:04:43.149 --> 02:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
Katherine Cooper appearing on behalf of
 
02:04:44.350 --> 02:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
02:04:46.629 --> 02:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
criminal defense lawyers um we oppose
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
this bill I respectfully uh disagree
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
with the two prior Witnesses um this
 
02:04:53.870 --> 02:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
will not make anyone safer and this will
 
02:04:56.549 --> 02:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
not offer anyone more protection um this
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
is simply inflating penalties um and
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
essentially making people who are um
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
misbehaving at an election felons um
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
02:05:11.109 --> 02:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
misdemeanant um I would also just like
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
to mention that I serve as the town
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
moderator um for the town that I live in
 
02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I have several years of experience
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
working at the polls and running the
 
02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:21.239 align:start position:0%
elections um I've also personally been
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
threatened a few times fortunately not
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
assaulted but um I agree that people do
 
02:05:28.669 --> 02:05:28.679 align:start position:0%
get a little out of hand and a little
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
hotheaded during election times um but I
 
02:05:35.069 --> 02:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
do not think that that justifies making
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
them a felon for what is essentially
 
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
simple assault I mean frankly I don't
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
even think that um this the statute
 
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
overall is necessary I think that the
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
general assault um statutes that we have
 
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
and the criminal threatening statutes
 
02:05:50.470 --> 02:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
that we have that apply to the general
 
02:05:52.669 --> 02:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
public are sufficient
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
um so I do not think this gives the
 
02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
police any more tools I would agree with
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
one of the comments made earlier that
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
based on the story that was told this
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
was likely a problem with how the police
 
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
handled the situation it had absolutely
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the statutory
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
structure of the state so for those
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
reasons um we think that this should not
 
02:06:15.229 --> 02:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
um be passed and would request that the
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you for your t
 
02:06:24.709 --> 02:06:24.719 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands raised the
 
02:06:26.229 --> 02:06:26.239 align:start position:0%
witness is
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
excused if there's any members of the
 
02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
public who wish to testify that are in
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
attendance that have not testified
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:54.069 --> 02:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%

Bill

02:07:05.350 --> 02:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:07:08.790 --> 02:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
419 it was actually my son and my family
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
that were involved in the Windham
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
incident um and from what I observed the
 
02:07:17.390 --> 02:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
the police were basically powerless on
 
02:07:20.310 --> 02:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
um that night of actually arresting for
 
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
a simple assault
 
02:07:25.390 --> 02:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
um you know that my son was there
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
expressing his first amendment rights
 
02:07:30.750 --> 02:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
those were infringed upon um I I think
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
it's a little deeper than someone just
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
slapping someone and calling it a a
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor I I think it goes beyond
 
02:07:39.669 --> 02:07:39.679 align:start position:0%
it's repressing someone's rights I think
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
it should carry a little bit of a higher
 
02:07:45.310 --> 02:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
penalty than uh what's currently on the
 
02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
books um so any
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
questions I mean our family's been been
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
through quite a bit through this whole
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh this whole ordeal and it still is
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
with us today A year later so still
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
talked about it quite a bit but um going
 
02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
forward I think the the perpetrator in
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
this whole thing even though he was
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
emotionally overwhelmed at that point he
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
he went in knowing um and calling um the
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
pole workers fascists and all this and
 
02:08:18.149 --> 02:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
he just snapped when he came out and H
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
the first person he could find who just
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
happened to be my son so um there's
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
unprovoked assault and uh and I I know
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
the police did their best they said they
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't do anything unless they
 
02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:31.709 align:start position:0%
couldn't do anything unless they
actually

02:08:31.709 --> 02:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
witnessed the perpetrator striking my
 
02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
son the public was not very happy when
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
they let him walk walk away but they did
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
build a case they did bring it to
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County and um I'm really not
 
02:08:46.149 --> 02:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
sure where the actual case that's at
 
02:08:51.069 --> 02:08:51.079 align:start position:0%
this point but I I do support making um
 
02:08:57.549 --> 02:08:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:00.599 align:start position:0%
happen thank you for your testimony and
 
02:09:04.030 --> 02:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh the chair just may inquire a question
 
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
so just for
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
clarification the police were present
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
but no one was arrested after this
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
incident happened and the ex what was
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
the explanation for why no one was
 
02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
arrested um the explanation given to me
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
as actually a first responder that went
 
02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
to the assault and it found out it was
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
my own son but um I was told by the
 
02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
police that due to the fact that it was
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
not a witnessed
 
02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
assault that just um Witnesses stating
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
what happened was not enough to arrest
 
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
somebody for assaulting a a a
 
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
minor or anything like that so they they
 
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
actually let him go and they actually
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
said they had to build a case before
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
um they could go forward with it um if
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
they had arrested him that night they
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
said that they really they really
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't hold on to him for any
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
particular reason so I think that's why
 
02:10:05.470 --> 02:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
this bill's coming
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
forward to put a little bit more teeth
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
into the into the campaign worker you
 
02:10:13.709 --> 02:10:13.719 align:start position:0%
know protecting
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
them thank you again my question
 
02:10:16.079 --> 02:10:17.870 align:start position:0%
them thank you again my question
representative

02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:21.069 --> 02:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
KN thank you chair and uh virtually you
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
had had pretty much the same question I
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
really want to know the reason and I'm
 
02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer uh forgive me um this is
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
maybe more of a question for the chair
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
because he is is that some is that
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
correct that police can take eyewitness
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
accounts from an assault of a minor and
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then not arrest
 
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
someone I please suspend for a
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
moment if you have any questions of the
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
chair especially technical ones that
 
02:10:55.470 --> 02:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
involve complic legal matters maybe we
 
02:10:58.510 --> 02:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
save that for the executive session okay
 
02:11:01.549 --> 02:11:01.559 align:start position:0%
apologies thank you I I just wasn't
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
aware that that I just think this is
 
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
outrageous and I think that the the
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
police department um we really should
 
02:11:12.549 --> 02:11:12.559 align:start position:0%
have an investigation on them following
 
02:11:12.559 --> 02:11:15.950 align:start position:0%
have an investigation on them following
proper

02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
protocols thank you

thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
02:11:27.870 --> 02:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
did you have any indication uh when this
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
was not followed up that the reason for
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
not following it up was that the penalty
 
02:11:37.149 --> 02:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
was not worth you know not severe enough
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
to make it worthwhile or if it had been
 
02:11:42.669 --> 02:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
some more severe that it would have been
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr Campbell yes uh I didn't know that
 
02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
question was directed me
 
02:12:05.430 --> 02:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
um I I think it was just going on a um
 
02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
it was just a minor infraction um you
 
02:12:12.270 --> 02:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
know I I thought that that assaulting a
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
minor would carry a little bit of a you
 
02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
know it would be almost a felony not a
 
02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but um you know to me it
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
went deeper than that it's like there he
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
is you know at an event um showing
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
support for a candidate and yet that had
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
no bearing on the
 
02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
situation I don't know if if he was out
 
02:12:36.549 --> 02:12:36.559 align:start position:0%
on the street at McDonald's and he got
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
in the same thing happened would the
 
02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
would the charges have been different
 
02:12:42.549 --> 02:12:42.559 align:start position:0%
that that's where my question lies I I
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
really don't
 
02:12:46.589 --> 02:12:46.599 align:start position:0%
know thank
 
02:12:49.990 --> 02:12:50.000 align:start position:0%

it but that but I will say that was an
 
02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate point of order how I not
 
02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
Clos it then open the executive session

credit for a correct point of
 
02:16:17.629 --> 02:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
order that means a lot to me actually
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
make correct
 
02:16:21.790 --> 02:16:21.800 align:start position:0%

02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
wish to speak on your motion of inp
 
02:16:28.390 --> 02:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
legisl thank you Mr chairman I will
 
02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
speak briefly uh Al we understand the
 
02:16:35.309 --> 02:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
intentions of this bill it is it it is
 
02:16:38.030 --> 02:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional on its face on creating
 
02:16:41.070 --> 02:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
a special class of of men if you will uh
 
02:16:43.709 --> 02:16:43.719 align:start position:0%
and that violates AR part first arle two
 
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:58.110 --> 02:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
repres you
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair um uh
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
sadly I find myself in the position of
 
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
of of having to oppose this bill um I
 
02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
think this bill uh is redundant with our
 
02:17:14.589 --> 02:17:14.599 align:start position:0%
trespass uh and assault laws uh I am
 
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
extremely sympathetic to the to the
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
situation and I wish there was an
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh uh to rewrite the bill
 
02:17:27.389 --> 02:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
so we could consider uh uh penalties uh
 
02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh in increasing the penalty somewhat um
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
for people who fall into these
 
02:17:36.790 --> 02:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
situations um uh I'm especially
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
sympathetic with grocery store workers
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
uh restaurant workers and other people
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh who found themselves in this
 
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
situation I I don't think this is a
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue um it's more of a
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
of a redundancy in our law issue um and
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
I and I think one of the unfortunate
 
02:17:58.709 --> 02:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
things is this has been uh conflated
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
into um uh a partisan situation when I
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
think you know what we're really talking
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
about here is the proper enforcement of
 
02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
the law throughout the emergency the
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
state of emergency I think there's been
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of confusion around how the orders
 
02:18:15.469 --> 02:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
should be enforced there's been a lot of
 
02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
anxiety on the part of people who own
 
02:18:20.589 --> 02:18:20.599 align:start position:0%
shops and stores and restaurants around
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
what the role is of their employees and
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
their staff um but what it doesn't
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
change is the fact that if if you are
 
02:18:30.669 --> 02:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
asked to leave a place of business um
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
because you're not complying with a
 
02:18:34.750 --> 02:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
policy of that business if you refuse to
 
02:18:36.990 --> 02:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
leave or you walk by that person you're
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
trespassing and the police can be called
 
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
to take you out um and if you decide to
 
02:18:47.469 --> 02:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
uh if you decide to uh to make a scene
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
and to push people around and to assault
 
02:18:51.469 --> 02:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
people then
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
the other laws of our state apply in
 
02:18:53.359 --> 02:18:54.150 align:start position:0%
the other laws of our state apply in
that

02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
situation I think we have more of a of a
 
02:19:02.150 --> 02:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
possibly an enforcement and an emphasis
 
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
issue um and I also think we have an
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
issue sometimes where uh the owners uh
 
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
or the supervisory staff in in grocery
 
02:19:14.230 --> 02:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
stores sometimes I don't think
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
understand uh especially early on in the
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic really understood the
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
importance of enforcing those orders so
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
all for the benefit of all their
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
customers from a public health
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
perspective but this particular uh Bill
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh the way it is written without an
 
02:19:34.070 --> 02:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh to change or fix it um
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
is not something that I can support
 
02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:38.549 align:start position:0%
is not something that I can support
going

02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:38.559 --> 02:19:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
forward

02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
representa I oppose this bill for a
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons we're focusing on the
 
02:19:50.399 --> 02:19:52.910 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons we're focusing on the
the

02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.429 --> 02:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
grocery store in since I think that repr
 
02:20:00.510 --> 02:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
Hopper presented one of the a good point
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
uh and that is if you look at this it
 
02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
basically says if you don't if you have
 
02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:06.750 align:start position:0%
basically says if you don't if you have
some

02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
policy uh that that your group intends
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
to enforce you it becomes a violation of
 
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
Law and and here it is relating health
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
or safety guide lines or recommendations
 
02:20:24.110 --> 02:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
regulations or rules from a federal
 
02:20:26.950 --> 02:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
state or local public health agency
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty broad statement and that
 
02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
could be as much
 
02:20:33.830 --> 02:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
as do you have a
 
02:20:37.910 --> 02:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination uh or as she said you you
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
you get into a an accident you're you're
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the hospital and you are injured and
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
they want to vaccinate you after they or
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
maybe before you they uh they they end
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
up treating I just think that this is
 
02:20:57.070 --> 02:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
such a broad law I know what it was
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do it was trying to say mask
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
was an anti- mask Law Without call an
 
02:21:05.230 --> 02:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
anti-mask law I just think but I think
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's broader
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
implications are absolutely
 
02:21:13.150 --> 02:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
horrendous the the kinds of injury that
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
justb represent po thank you Mr chairman
 
02:21:27.389 --> 02:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
uh to uh uh one one question uh of the
 
02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
chair I guess is
 
02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:31.030 align:start position:0%
chair I guess is
[Music]

02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why you kind of ruled me
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
out of order because the the although I
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
was making a joke about the pedicure the
 
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
idea that the store can already enforce
 
02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:44.309 align:start position:0%
idea that the store can already enforce
Health

02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
Health
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances seem to be very relevant
 
02:21:48.590 --> 02:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
because this is just an additional
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
Health ordinance are youing a point of
 
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
order I'm just commenting so the uh but
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
the bigger point is the sponsor seems to
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
be extremely well-intentioned
 
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
but the way that the court
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
rules has nothing to do with intention
 
02:22:11.309 --> 02:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
the court only rules on the actual
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
letter of the law that we pass and
 
02:22:17.710 --> 02:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
whether we intended to do X Y or Z is
 
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
entirely irrelevant when it gets to the
 
02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:21.550 align:start position:0%
entirely irrelevant when it gets to the
court

02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:22:24.990 --> 02:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
so well as representative Testament said
 
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
this could be this law if passed could
 
02:22:30.670 --> 02:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
be applied in a myriad of ways none of
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
which were intended but could still be
 
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
abused by people to uh
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
suppress represent hoer at the time that
 
02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
you were asking the question I may not
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
have found it to be relevant I may have
 
02:22:45.389 --> 02:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
gotten lost in the analogy and if that's
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
the case it may have been relevant I do
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
apologize was it just the thought of my
 
02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
feet that probably that probably
 
02:22:55.750 --> 02:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
distra but I do
 
02:23:01.630 --> 02:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
apologize representative fly
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
Knight in the future in the future
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
though a point of order must be made
 
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
immediately if you made a point of order
 
02:23:09.309 --> 02:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
now it actually would be an incorrect
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
point of
 
02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
order I didn't want to get
 
02:23:15.950 --> 02:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
into thank
 
02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
you f night um thank you chair um
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
I agree with everything that my
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
colleagues are saying unfortunately I
 
02:23:29.469 --> 02:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
think we could work on this and out of
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
respect for Frontline workers I think it
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
would be a disservice to immediately
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
kill this right out of the gate so I'll
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
be voting against the itl thank
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
you representative true thank you Mr
 
02:23:44.670 --> 02:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
chair Mr chair maybe it just as a point
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
of information uh would the chair be
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
willing and able to uh explain what the
 
02:23:53.389 --> 02:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
the end of the bills for a period of 6
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
months after such declaration what what
 
02:24:01.269 --> 02:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
what time frame is so my my
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that and I will just
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
limit that to my own
 
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation so whatever violation of
 
02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
this if this were to pass and the
 
02:24:14.230 --> 02:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
violation or were
 
02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
occur while we are in the current state
 
02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
of emergency that is declared by the
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
governor the covid-19 pandemic but this
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
would also remain in effect six months
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
thereafter it also will this will take
 
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
effect January 1st of
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
2022 maybe have a glass half whole type
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
of guy but I'm really hoping that we are
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
no longer in a state of emergency by
 
02:24:41.990 --> 02:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
January 1st
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
2022 that's just
 
02:24:50.429 --> 02:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative boate thank you Mr chair
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh support the the motion
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
to itl uh this bill is completely
 
02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um uh we have laws for
 
02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
assault both first second and simple
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
assault uh we have laws against
 
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
threatening criminal
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
threatening but the third section
 
02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
refuses to
 
02:25:21.070 --> 02:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
comply as an assault charge
 
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
with uh that not
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
mean being the meaning the intent of the
 
02:25:32.910 --> 02:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh a sponsor um is really AB
 
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
Abomination I don't think that they
 
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
understood the bill that they wrote so
 
02:25:50.390 --> 02:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:54.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
that I would just emphasize one point
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
here that refuses to comply with another
 
02:26:08.910 --> 02:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
I I understand maybe well
 
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
intended that could apply to social
 
02:26:14.429 --> 02:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
distancing for someone who inadvertently
 
02:26:16.349 --> 02:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
becomes within six feet of another
 
02:26:16.359 --> 02:26:20.429 align:start position:0%
becomes within six feet of another
person

02:26:20.429 --> 02:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
this this is going to be tough to
 
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
enforce one of the you know I don't
 
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
really engage in the conversation about
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
masks I always thought it would be hard
 
02:26:32.309 --> 02:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
to enforce on 1.3 million people but um
 
02:26:33.870 --> 02:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
I think this this would fall into being
 
02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
very difficult to enforce and then
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutes with that being said if you
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
have to ask someone to comply with a
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
health order through the you know Co
 
02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's the mass mandate or
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
whatever that they're technically
 
02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
already violating the executive order
 
02:26:54.269 --> 02:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
which is already in offense that's I
 
02:26:56.110 --> 02:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
think it's it used to be a misdemeanor
 
02:26:58.630 --> 02:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
the executive order change that to a
 
02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
civil penalty but it's already that is
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
also still against the law already to
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
not comply with these these orders so I
 
02:27:08.269 --> 02:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
don't we just instead of saying you're
 
02:27:10.910 --> 02:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
being charged for violating the you know
 
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
state of emergency order you're being
 
02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
charged under a second degree assault
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
but you're not committing second degree
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
assault you're you're violating
 
02:27:22.349 --> 02:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
executive order I I think
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's if you're confused by what I just
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
said is the reason why you should
 
02:27:31.269 --> 02:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
I seeing no for a hand raised
 
02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh question will be
 
02:27:39.269 --> 02:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
moved uh the clerk will now call the
 
02:27:41.269 --> 02:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
role if you are in favor of the motion
 
02:27:44.190 --> 02:27:44.200 align:start position:0%

02:27:48.340 --> 02:27:48.350 align:start position:0%

you folks hear me yes we can all right

Zoom sessions um so this is House Bill
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
239 FN uh I'm not sure why there's a
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on it but uh
 
02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
um this I introduced this bill last
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
session and it was one of the bills that
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously and of course passed
 
02:30:58.670 --> 02:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
unanimously through the house by a
 
02:31:00.670 --> 02:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
consent calendar and was killed during
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
the uh Corona virus lockdown the Senate
 
02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
didn't take up uh you know vast majority
 
02:31:09.830 --> 02:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
of our 2020 bills so essentially what
 
02:31:13.790 --> 02:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
the bill deals with is a problem where
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh a child is abused or is the victim of
 
02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
felony assault uh frequently with
 
02:31:21.030 --> 02:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
someone they live with or stay with
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh if if it's felony assault the current
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations is six years and
 
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
I absolutely agree with the statute idea
 
02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
of a statute of limitations the New
 
02:31:32.269 --> 02:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has said that
 
02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
there are two very important reasons for
 
02:31:36.389 --> 02:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
having a statute of limitations that is
 
02:31:38.269 --> 02:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
to kind of get the prosecutor on the
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
ball and get get the case moving forward
 
02:31:43.389 --> 02:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
and not have things just uh delay in the
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
courts for a long periods of time and
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
also to ensure that the accused has the
 
02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
right to bring in defense Witnesses in
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
their favor uh who have a relatively
 
02:31:55.790 --> 02:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
fresh memory of the incident if an
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
incident occurred or if there's an alibi
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
or some such thing um that but there's a
 
02:32:03.670 --> 02:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
problem uh with a child uh the child is
 
02:32:06.429 --> 02:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
usually living with someone else um or
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
staying with someone else or has a
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
regular babysitter and that that child
 
02:32:14.309 --> 02:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
could be uh severely victimized um and
 
02:32:17.349 --> 02:32:17.359 align:start position:0%
if they are subject to Serious bodily
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
injury uh intentionally by another
 
02:32:22.910 --> 02:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh attacker especially if it's someone
 
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
they live with then it's unlikely that
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to come forward right away
 
02:32:31.469 --> 02:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
so I I don't base bills on specific in
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
instances or incidences but this one is
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
an exception where there was a child
 
02:32:39.070 --> 02:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
where the the physical abuse started at
 
02:32:41.309 --> 02:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
age four and there was certainly felony
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
assault committed against him um at at
 
02:32:47.910 --> 02:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
some point along the way the problem is
 
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
that whatever attack happened when he is
 
02:32:51.830 --> 02:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
4 years old the statute of limitations
 
02:32:54.070 --> 02:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
has run out by the time he's age
 
02:32:57.750 --> 02:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
10 so I had a sit down with legislative
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
services and um I suggested last session
 
02:33:04.510 --> 02:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
that we start the clock on the statute
 
02:33:07.150 --> 02:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
of limitations when the child turns
 
02:33:10.230 --> 02:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
18 and a few members have suggested okay
 
02:33:11.469 --> 02:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
well it's a six-year statute of
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
limitations why not have it go until
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
their 24th birthday and that would be
 
02:33:18.990 --> 02:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
much simpler uh one of the the problems
 
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
if you read New Hampshire case law is
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
from time to time you'll have somebody
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
who knows that they're accused of a
 
02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
crime and they'll leave the state for an
 
02:33:28.990 --> 02:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
amount of time or they'll be
 
02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
inaccessible um so the the the actual
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
statute of limitations clock if you
 
02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
think of it as a stopwatch it has to be
 
02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
it can only be running down while the
 
02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutor has a realistic chance to go
 
02:33:42.110 --> 02:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
after someone so that's that's why the
 
02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
wording seems a little bit odd six years
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
after their 18th birthday that the so
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
the child turns 18 the victim turns 18
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then the victim has 6 years to come
 
02:33:56.070 --> 02:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
forward um and it has to be six years
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
while the uh the attacker is still in
 
02:33:59.750 --> 02:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
the state and is accessible by the
 
02:34:01.870 --> 02:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and they can they can get
 
02:34:03.389 --> 02:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
access to Witnesses sometimes you have
 
02:34:04.510 --> 02:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
people who know they've committed a
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
crime and they they'll even leave the
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
country to evade Justice and try to run
 
02:34:10.110 --> 02:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
out the statute of limitations so that's
 
02:34:13.150 --> 02:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
why it's it's 18th birthday plus six
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
years um but again this committee did
 
02:34:18.230 --> 02:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
pass it unanimously last year it was
 
02:34:20.349 --> 02:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
just we we sent sended over to the
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
Senate and they they took a large number
 
02:34:24.429 --> 02:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
of bills a couple hundred bills and uh
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
they just tabled them and they died on
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
the they died on the table unfortunately
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
so this is one of a few bills that I'm
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
reintroducing this year uh in hopes of
 
02:34:37.710 --> 02:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for Mr chairman
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
recognizing me and thank you
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting in on criminal law today and
 
02:34:58.469 --> 02:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
learning quite a bit but I want to ask
 
02:35:02.750 --> 02:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
you something in 2005 I co-sponsored
 
02:35:04.349 --> 02:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
75 which was very similar to this
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
related to RSA
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
508 colon 4 hyphen
 
02:35:17.110 --> 02:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
g at the time I sponsored the bill it
 
02:35:19.230 --> 02:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
was so similar it was seven years from
 
02:35:21.590 --> 02:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
the 18 birthday and then there was three
 
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
years from the time of the plaintiff
 
02:35:29.070 --> 02:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
Discovery but if you look at 508 colon 4
 
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
hyphen G
 
02:35:34.710 --> 02:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
today there is no statute of
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
limitations have you compared your bill
 
02:35:40.230 --> 02:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
with that statute and how does it relate
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
if it does it
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
all uh is that 508 section 4-g a person
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
alleging to have been subject to any of
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
offense under RSA 32A or 6392 may
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
commence a personal action at any time
 
02:35:57.950 --> 02:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
correct that one is is based on sexual
 
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
assault so um that one for some reason I
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
I I read it some years ago in another
 
02:36:07.630 --> 02:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
case that it was 22 years and maybe you
 
02:36:11.309 --> 02:36:11.319 align:start position:0%
changed the law to to remove that
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
um and um I personally believe that you
 
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
have to have a statute of limitations um
 
02:36:18.269 --> 02:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
having read the New Hampshire Supreme
 
02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
Court cases on
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
um but I thought well if if someone
 
02:36:25.349 --> 02:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
commits sexual assault and that doesn't
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
have the six-year statute of limitations
 
02:36:30.790 --> 02:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
why aren't we also having a why aren't
 
02:36:32.990 --> 02:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
we also starting the clock when the it's
 
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
it was actually at the time it was the
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
child turns 18 and then it was I think
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
22 years which I I feel like is a is a
 
02:36:41.550 --> 02:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
long time to let the prosecutor kind of
 
02:36:46.030 --> 02:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
sit on a case it's very rare um after a
 
02:36:47.870 --> 02:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
year or two it's very rare that the the
 
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
prosecution just accumulat
 
02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
additional evidence by chance although
 
02:36:53.790 --> 02:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
it does happen does happen in wrongful
 
02:36:57.150 --> 02:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
conviction cases um but the the statute
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
of limitations is intended to kind of
 
02:37:01.389 --> 02:37:01.399 align:start position:0%
get the investigators to get moving and
 
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
not not hold on to cases and allow the
 
02:37:06.429 --> 02:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
once you're accused of a crime uh you
 
02:37:08.469 --> 02:37:08.479 align:start position:0%
need to be able to have a realistic
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
chance to go after your own defense
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and and gather evidence um and
 
02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
um um there's there's a whole line of
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
law dealing with that but um that one I
 
02:37:23.269 --> 02:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
thought was just sexual assault related
 
02:37:25.550 --> 02:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
crimes so I thought well if it's felony
 
02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
sexual assault for example against a
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
child then it made sense that if someone
 
02:37:33.070 --> 02:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
also committed felony physical assault
 
02:37:36.349 --> 02:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
breaking a child's arm for example um or
 
02:37:37.950 --> 02:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
causing some other long protracted
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
injury purposely causing serious bodily
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
injury to a child that that would be
 
02:37:45.510 --> 02:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
obviously felony assault even if they're
 
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
13 or 14 years old it would still that
 
02:37:49.870 --> 02:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
in that case would still be felony
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
assault but it made sense in my mind to
 
02:37:53.790 --> 02:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
just start the clock when a child turns
 
02:37:57.070 --> 02:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
18 rather than potentially the child
 
02:37:58.630 --> 02:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
turns 18 and now they're out on their
 
02:38:00.990 --> 02:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
own they then go to report the case now
 
02:38:03.550 --> 02:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
that they're no longer under the roof of
 
02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:04.349 align:start position:0%
that they're no longer under the roof of
their

02:38:04.349 --> 02:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:38:08.910 --> 02:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
attacker um that it it didn't make sense
 
02:38:11.110 --> 02:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
in that case that could be the in some
 
02:38:12.910 --> 02:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
cases the first opportunity that the
 
02:38:15.429 --> 02:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
victim has to come forward and Report
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
felony physical assault um it made sense
 
02:38:21.150 --> 02:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
to me that this the statute of
 
02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
limitations should actually run when
 
02:38:25.269 --> 02:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
there's a realistic chance the clock
 
02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
should run there should be a statute of
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
limitations but the clock should only
 
02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
run when there is a realistic chance to
 
02:38:34.630 --> 02:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:37.230 --> 02:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
perpetrator so yes I am aware that it it
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
is different under sexual assault cases
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm I just wanted to keep this
 
02:38:47.550 --> 02:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.389 --> 02:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
night thank you chair thanks for taking
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
my question um do you know on average
 
02:39:02.630 --> 02:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
how long it takes for the typical abused
 
02:39:07.790 --> 02:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
child to come forward and make their uh
 
02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:09.070 align:start position:0%
child to come forward and make their uh
situation

02:39:09.070 --> 02:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
known how many years basically when they
 
02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
sit with trauma do they finally come
 
02:39:17.790 --> 02:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
forward it could be the same
 
02:39:21.990 --> 02:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
day um however in some cases both
 
02:39:24.150 --> 02:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
physical abuse and sexual abuse people
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
are frequently in their in their 20s
 
02:39:29.469 --> 02:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
before they come forward um in some
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
cases there are certain types of
 
02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:33.110 align:start position:0%
cases there are certain types of
abuse

02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
02:39:37.150 --> 02:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
um for example um trying to remember the
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
experiments by Joseph mangala this not
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
an American case but people were
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
children were subject to physical abuse
 
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
that was so bad that it fractured their
 
02:39:46.990 --> 02:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
personality and with Joseph mango was
 
02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
taking the the extremes of torture in
 
02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
order to change their mind he was trying
 
02:39:55.150 --> 02:39:55.160 align:start position:0%
to create something like a Manchurian
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
Candidate or somebody could be
 
02:39:59.110 --> 02:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
controlled but they found that um that
 
02:40:00.630 --> 02:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
that the trauma could be so bad that it
 
02:40:02.349 --> 02:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
could fracture their personality and
 
02:40:05.070 --> 02:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
people could be as old as 28 years old
 
02:40:07.750 --> 02:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
by the time the they were finally able
 
02:40:11.710 --> 02:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
to access their memories so it it it's
 
02:40:15.790 --> 02:40:15.800 align:start position:0%
possible uh in that case um although
 
02:40:19.630 --> 02:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
that's a very exceptional case um that
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
um due to the psychological damage it
 
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
could take even longer it could take up
 
02:40:25.630 --> 02:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
to 10 years or 15 years before the
 
02:40:29.469 --> 02:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
person um uh realizes it before the
 
02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
memories finally come forward and the
 
02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
and the the the brain is developed
 
02:40:34.990 --> 02:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
enough that they can go back and review
 
02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:35.950 align:start position:0%
enough that they can go back and review
what

02:40:35.950 --> 02:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:38.070 align:start position:0%
what
happened

02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
followup you recognize for a followup
 
02:40:44.190 --> 02:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
question with that being said this bill
 
02:40:46.510 --> 02:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't protect them in my
 
02:40:51.230 --> 02:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
understanding and uh it my question is
 
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
with 90% of children being abused by
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
victims of or members of their own
 
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
family and knowing that it takes that
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
long to come forward and be brave and
 
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
tell your story are you open to an
 
02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:09.590 align:start position:0%
tell your story are you open to an
amendment

02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:41:13.110 --> 02:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
to make this this six years seems like
 
02:41:15.469 --> 02:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
it's just not going to protect the
 
02:41:19.550 --> 02:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
majority of victims that wait to come
 
02:41:20.830 --> 02:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
because they don't feel safe to tell
 
02:41:20.840 --> 02:41:21.790 align:start position:0%
because they don't feel safe to tell
their

02:41:21.790 --> 02:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:41:24.910 --> 02:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
story I'd even thought of going to 10 or
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
12 years um after they turn 18s so that
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
they're in the you know well into their
 
02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
20s when they they uh come forward um I
 
02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
think that pushing it even further might
 
02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
be um obviously the the bill now belongs
 
02:41:42.110 --> 02:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
to the committee um so it's a decision
 
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
that's up to you um but I'm just
 
02:41:46.830 --> 02:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill to introduce the
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
the the question or the problem what
 
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do of course is with the
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
law create a deterrence so that there's
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
at least a realistic chance that
 
02:41:57.550 --> 02:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who uh commits this type of
 
02:42:00.670 --> 02:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
felony assault against a child uh yes a
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
super majority of cases it's it's
 
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who is under the same roof but
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why whatever you choose
 
02:42:09.790 --> 02:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
to set the statute of limitations at I
 
02:42:12.469 --> 02:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
would start the clock when at their 18th
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:25.150 --> 02:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
seeing No Hands raised representative
 
02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
Abramson you are excused thank
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
you are there any members of the public
 
02:42:33.230 --> 02:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
who wish to testify that have not
 
02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:38.150 align:start position:0%
who wish to testify that have not
testified

02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:40.990 --> 02:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
already seeing No Hands
 
02:42:44.429 --> 02:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
raised we now close the public hearing
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
on on House
 
02:42:50.309 --> 02:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:54.349 --> 02:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair on House Bill 239 we had 12
 
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:57.160 align:start position:0%

people signing in an
 
02:43:03.389 --> 02:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
opposition say again uh 12 in support
 
02:43:07.750 --> 02:43:07.760 align:start position:0%

supporter of this bill I do think that
 
03:35:51.990 --> 03:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
it is necessary however um I do think
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the bill uh there's some some work
 
03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
that can be done on it I think to make
 
03:36:02.030 --> 03:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.040 --> 03:36:04.550 align:start position:0%

that this bill has no merit after
 
03:36:16.750 --> 03:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
listening to Katherine Cooper I was
 
03:36:20.550 --> 03:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
um convinced that there is no reason for
 
03:36:22.070 --> 03:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
to have this
 
03:36:25.389 --> 03:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:28.239 align:start position:0%

the statement that it has no merit but
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%

representative roads made the motion I

03:40:29.910 --> 03:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
307 I believe this this last
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
open went recess because there was an
 
03:40:35.550 --> 03:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that was
 
03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:38.349 align:start position:0%
amendment that was
202-

03:40:38.349 --> 03:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
202-
 
03:40:40.750 --> 03:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
0411 some concerns by committee members
 
03:40:43.229 --> 03:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
that were expressed loud and clear about
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
having an opportunity to review the

03:40:49.469 --> 03:40:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:52.510 --> 03:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
that was on Friday
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman
 
03:43:56.309 --> 03:43:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is so bad that any
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
amendment to it will not improve it
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
unless it is to repeal uh RSA 159 colon
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:15.199 --> 03:44:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:21.670 --> 03:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
M yes I'm uh opposing this amendment and
 
03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
I do realize that there uh there have
 
03:44:27.790 --> 03:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
been some changes made the level of
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
liability uh has been reduced from
 
03:44:31.990 --> 03:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
$10,000 um and uh it looks like
 
03:44:38.510 --> 03:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
individual uh elected officials in
 
03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
cities and towns uh will no longer be
 
03:44:45.229 --> 03:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
liable uh personally uh for for the for
 
03:44:48.149 --> 03:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
the cost of the suit but what it what it
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
still does um is it essentially allows
 
03:44:55.030 --> 03:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh any person uh or not any person but
 
03:44:57.269 --> 03:44:57.279 align:start position:0%
it it it involves allowing people who do
 
03:45:00.590 --> 03:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
not live in a particular Community who
 
03:45:03.189 --> 03:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
consider themselves AG grieved uh
 
03:45:05.469 --> 03:45:05.479 align:start position:0%
whatever AG grieved means from a legal
 
03:45:07.710 --> 03:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
standpoint um to bring one of these
 
03:45:11.710 --> 03:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
suits and to file to file for damages um
 
03:45:13.750 --> 03:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
I think that regardless of whether we're
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
talking about Second Amendment First
 
03:45:16.990 --> 03:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment Third Amendment Fourth
 
03:45:19.750 --> 03:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment is an extremely dangerous
 
03:45:22.990 --> 03:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
precedent for us to set um we heard
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
testimony uh from the New Hampshire
 
03:45:25.199 --> 03:45:26.309 align:start position:0%
testimony uh from the New Hampshire
Municipal

03:45:26.309 --> 03:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
03:45:29.189 --> 03:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
Association uh that they opposed this
 
03:45:31.550 --> 03:45:31.560 align:start position:0%

03:45:33.630 --> 03:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
municipal Association oppos this bill
 
03:45:35.950 --> 03:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
have not been addressed uh in the
 
03:45:39.750 --> 03:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so I have to agree with uh
 
03:45:43.469 --> 03:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
with h representative Bourne um
 
03:45:45.189 --> 03:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
amendment should go down and this bill
 
03:45:52.149 --> 03:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:56.110 --> 03:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:58.189 --> 03:45:58.199 align:start position:0%

truth thank you Mr
 
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
chair uh the way I'm reading uh
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
307 uh with the
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
amendment is it is uh it is simply
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
restating the fact
 
03:46:21.229 --> 03:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:26.750 --> 03:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
state and to reinforce that fact so
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
that all municipalities in the state
 
03:46:34.429 --> 03:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
recognize that fact it puts some
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
teeth into a
 
03:46:39.870 --> 03:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
penalty for a town that
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
says we don't agree that New Hampshire
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
is a Dylan rule state and we'll do
 
03:46:47.710 --> 03:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
things our own
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
way and under New Hampshire law and
 
03:46:54.189 --> 03:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
Dylan rule they don't have the authority
 
03:46:55.670 --> 03:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
to say
 
03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%

uh regarding firearms that is in
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
conflict with the Dyan
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%

I'm from
 
03:47:30.429 --> 03:47:30.439 align:start position:0%

regulate uh schools on their property
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
which federal law already uh permits
 
03:50:58.790 --> 03:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
those regulations in fact they restrict
 
03:51:01.349 --> 03:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh the use of the carrying of guns on
 
03:51:04.269 --> 03:51:04.279 align:start position:0%
school property unless they have a uh
 
03:51:07.870 --> 03:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
concealed uh permit
 
03:51:12.510 --> 03:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
um and then if a a town or municipality
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
want to restrict the use the The
 
03:51:18.670 --> 03:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
Possession or use of firearms in public
 
03:51:22.189 --> 03:51:22.199 align:start position:0%
parks they should be able to do that on
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
their on their own individual town now
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh if some towns don't want any
 
03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the use of firearms in
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
their Parks then they don't have to uh
 
03:51:39.149 --> 03:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
make such ordinance but I totally re uh
 
03:51:52.550 --> 03:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:52.560 --> 03:51:55.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you Mr chair I I I think
 
03:52:02.790 --> 03:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
that bill um in addition to all the
 
03:52:05.149 --> 03:52:05.159 align:start position:0%
other issues it has also has a a
 
03:52:09.750 --> 03:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue um so in particular
 
03:52:12.990 --> 03:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
um the definition of AG grieved is
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
having a feeling that one has been been
 
03:52:18.510 --> 03:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
wronged um and this is very different
 
03:52:20.429 --> 03:52:20.439 align:start position:0%
than the requirements under our law that
 
03:52:22.910 --> 03:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrating a person or entity has
 
03:52:25.269 --> 03:52:25.279 align:start position:0%
required a definite and concrete
 
03:52:27.670 --> 03:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
personal injury and has personal rights
 
03:52:29.950 --> 03:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
that were impaired or prejudiced which
 
03:52:33.149 --> 03:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
is actually required by part one article
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
74 of the State
 
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh in order to have
 
03:52:40.229 --> 03:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
standing to bring a lawsuit I feel that
 
03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
this this bill um that we're about to
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
take and not to pass with mment vote on
 
03:52:49.389 --> 03:52:49.399 align:start position:0%
um is unconstitutional for that reason
 
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:59.630 --> 03:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
support repres
 
03:53:03.229 --> 03:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman it
 
03:53:05.950 --> 03:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
in reference to representative Bourne's
 
03:53:08.469 --> 03:53:08.479 align:start position:0%
comments that if a if a town or
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
municipality and I'm not quoting exactly
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
so the town municipality wants to make a
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
a rule or a law that says that you're
 
03:53:18.670 --> 03:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
not allowed to have your firearm in
 
03:53:22.990 --> 03:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.510 --> 03:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
that how how could that even be a second
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't even know what to say to
 
03:53:29.469 --> 03:53:29.479 align:start position:0%
that so when you're driving through a
 
03:53:33.790 --> 03:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
town now you have to stop and take the
 
03:53:35.870 --> 03:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
you know take your magazine out of your
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
firearm go lock it up in your trunk get
 
03:53:40.229 --> 03:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
through that town go back be able to go
 
03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
back to being able to protect yourself
 
03:53:41.680 --> 03:53:43.110 align:start position:0%
back to being able to protect yourself
again

03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:53:46.229 --> 03:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
not I I'm sorry I I've got nothing else
 
03:53:50.590 --> 03:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:50.600 --> 03:53:52.189 align:start position:0%
 
say

03:53:52.189 --> 03:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:53:55.630 --> 03:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
representative K Knight um thank you
 
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
chair thanks colleagues you know in
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
light of what representative bordon and
 
03:54:04.870 --> 03:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative Muse uh have said I I
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
can't support this it opens up the state
 
03:54:14.030 --> 03:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
to being sued because it directly is in
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
conf with federal laws that are already
 
03:54:19.389 --> 03:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
placed here and if that is the case that
 
03:54:20.550 --> 03:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
means our
 
03:54:24.070 --> 03:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will be paying for the right
 
03:54:26.670 --> 03:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
for everyone else to just carry their
 
03:54:30.389 --> 03:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
guns and and not be an observant of the
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines that are already in
 
03:54:35.110 --> 03:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
place and that's very irresponsible and
 
03:54:37.149 --> 03:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
it's not fair to my citizens and for
 
03:54:39.630 --> 03:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
that reason I'll will be voting against
 
03:54:39.640 --> 03:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
that reason I'll will be voting against
this

03:54:48.300 --> 03:54:48.310 align:start position:0%

Georgia not too long ago and he told me
 
03:54:59.590 --> 03:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
that there's a town in Georgia that if
 
03:55:01.110 --> 03:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
you want to live in that town the
 
03:55:03.429 --> 03:55:03.439 align:start position:0%
requirement is that you own a
 
03:55:06.469 --> 03:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
firearm and everyone in that town has a
 
03:55:08.830 --> 03:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
firearm and it's one of the safest towns
 
03:55:10.389 --> 03:55:10.399 align:start position:0%
in the
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%

I'll second
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
it that motion has been about the pass
 
04:00:55.750 --> 04:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
been seconded by represent
 
04:00:58.110 --> 04:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
Gite you wish to speak your motion about
 
04:01:01.389 --> 04:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
the pass I think this is a reasonable
 
04:01:05.510 --> 04:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
extension of uh uh present law to uh
 
04:01:08.429 --> 04:01:08.439 align:start position:0%
allow the statute of limitations to go
 
04:01:16.630 --> 04:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:18.790 --> 04:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative B and uh you
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
and I both uh served on the committee
 
04:01:23.950 --> 04:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
last term as a lot of members and I
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
believe we passed this uh on consent is
 
04:01:30.550 --> 04:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
that am I correct when I say that yes
 
04:01:38.910 --> 04:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
probably thanks um I don't have the
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
statistics in front of me but the I know
 
04:01:49.590 --> 04:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
the majority of of uh child abuse
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
Survivor victims of child
 
04:01:55.710 --> 04:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
abuse really take a long time to come
 
04:01:59.870 --> 04:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
forward so I this is great but I I don't
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
think it it's does enough I don't
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
think 18 plus six years is enough for
 
04:02:10.910 --> 04:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
victims um so I really would like i'
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
really like us to to make this longer
 
04:02:17.149 --> 04:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I I hope there's someone on the
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee that feels the same way I do I
 
04:02:21.710 --> 04:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
I I wish we could make an
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
amendment um for that um but if that
 
04:02:28.189 --> 04:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
isn't the case I'd rather see this pass
 
04:02:32.670 --> 04:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
than nothing at all so um thank you
 
04:02:35.030 --> 04:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
represent night I I
 
04:02:36.950 --> 04:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you had to say and I
 
04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
will tell you this I do agree with you
 
04:02:41.950 --> 04:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
that I I would at at different times
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
would support making six years 10 years
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
but I will say we did have a bill last
 
04:02:50.590 --> 04:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
term that did not pass that would have
 
04:02:52.830 --> 04:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
got rid of the stat lications all the
 
04:02:55.110 --> 04:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
way we could reach a point where too
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
much is too much so I would say would
 
04:03:00.189 --> 04:03:00.199 align:start position:0%
start with six but in another term at a
 
04:03:01.510 --> 04:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
different time if you and I are both
 
04:03:04.590 --> 04:03:04.600 align:start position:0%

please someone make sure this is
 
04:05:16.269 --> 04:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
communicate with R so we're in all
 
04:05:18.910 --> 04:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
likelihood we're going to meet on the
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
11th sorry the 10th so after Wednesday
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
the 3 we're going to meet on Wednesday
 
04:05:27.710 --> 04:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
the 10th right we're also going to
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
have something scheduled on the 11 in
 
04:05:33.510 --> 04:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
case we don't that's also our deadline
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
so all the bills we have left need need
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
be out this committee with reports my
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
ADD so if I get a little
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know fired up getting your report
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
forson just forgive me now but
 
04:05:50.030 --> 04:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's I'm going to get some
 
04:05:51.590 --> 04:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
clarification on whether we have to
 
04:05:53.309 --> 04:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
schedule something for the 11th or we
 
04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
can just meet to EXA it's not proper for
 
04:05:57.790 --> 04:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
us to formally notice an executive
 
04:05:59.309 --> 04:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
session but if we can avoid meeting on
 
04:06:02.510 --> 04:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
the 11 that would be great so my
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
question is to the members whatever's
 
04:06:07.149 --> 04:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
left on Wednesday it would be about
 
04:06:09.710 --> 04:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
eight bills we can get all those done on
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
Wednesday kind of like
 
04:06:15.030 --> 04:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
a marathon if we can get that done we
 
04:06:16.349 --> 04:06:16.359 align:start position:0%
don't have to come in on Thursday but it
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
may be a late night and then you you'll
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
have we get our reports let's keep that
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
in mind is there any feeling on us
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%

wish for someone to sub
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
for simple as
 
04:07:05.870 --> 04:07:05.880 align:start position:0%

04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%

back if we're gonna go past five o'clock
 
04:07:21.389 --> 04:07:21.399 align:start position:0%
you should probably get a substitute for
 
04:07:24.070 --> 04:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
me you would have to formally notify me
 
04:07:26.469 --> 04:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
that you can't but that's we would I can
 
04:07:28.189 --> 04:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
Envision us you need to be prepared to
 
04:07:30.750 --> 04:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
go past five if you want to be present
 
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.680 align:start position:0%

04:07:39.309 --> 04:07:39.319 align:start position:0%

believe the only Bill other Bill we have
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
419 at this time that we are opening the
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 419
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
relative to the assault of a campaign
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.279 --> 04:08:19.429 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:08:19.429 --> 04:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:22.349 --> 04:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chair I like to make a
 
04:08:27.229 --> 04:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.239 --> 04:08:29.389 align:start position:0%
 
bill

04:08:29.389 --> 04:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
second that motion has been seconded by
 
04:08:33.550 --> 04:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative Hopper represent you wish
 
04:08:34.670 --> 04:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
to speak to your
 
04:08:39.870 --> 04:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes um I feel the the bill is
 
04:08:44.109 --> 04:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and um
 
04:08:48.630 --> 04:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
the the raising of uh the assault issue
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
at for a campaign worker which is we're
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
not sure what who that who that person
 
04:08:59.189 --> 04:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
is uh from a possible simple assault to
 
04:09:06.189 --> 04:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
uh a uh uh felony assault is I think
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:14.159 --> 04:09:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:09:16.990 --> 04:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
m i i I would agree I I would also say
 
04:09:24.910 --> 04:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
that um we do have existing assault
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
statutes on the books um that would seem
 
04:09:31.149 --> 04:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
to uh to address these issues I think
 
04:09:33.870 --> 04:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
this is sort of our day to get um
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
legislation we really sympathize with my
 
04:09:40.750 --> 04:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh my wife is a campaign worker um I
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
think all of us at one time or the other
 
04:09:45.109 --> 04:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
have in our careers have stood outside a
 
04:09:47.389 --> 04:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
polling place with a sign in our hands
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
and understand what it's like to kind of
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
deal with people who might be might be
 
04:09:55.389 --> 04:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
confrontational um but we do have laws
 
04:09:59.189 --> 04:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
in the books that uh that that do
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
provide Justice in these situations and
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
I think maybe one of the things that
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
might be necessary in some departments
 
04:10:08.590 --> 04:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
is occasionally reminding officers you
 
04:10:12.429 --> 04:10:12.439 align:start position:0%
know especially in in inflammatory
 
04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
situations like the polls can be anymore
 
04:10:17.910 --> 04:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh to really be on the lookout for this
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
stuff and to and to not have uh any
 
04:10:24.269 --> 04:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
tolerance at all for physical
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
confrontations um but um I like I said I
 
04:10:31.630 --> 04:10:31.640 align:start position:0%
I I sympathize with where the sponsor is
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
coming from but I'm I don't agree with
 
04:10:38.670 --> 04:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
changing our law uh in the manner that's
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
if I can just point out this is
 
04:10:49.590 --> 04:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
more not necessarily the policy of this
 
04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill it does say in there I find it it
 
04:10:56.750 --> 04:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
says a Class A or class B
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
felony uh which when we see something
 
04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
written that way just for interpretation
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
purposes it really leaves the leaves it
 
04:11:07.389 --> 04:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
within the discretion of the
 
04:11:13.349 --> 04:11:13.359 align:start position:0%
county county just to prosecute A or B
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
law is written that way if it's a really
 
04:11:16.790 --> 04:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
old law will
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
have be written sometimes we just say
 
04:11:22.990 --> 04:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
felony but a person needs to be on
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
notice when they're being charged what
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
the offense
 
04:11:29.149 --> 04:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
is so they know what the penalty is
 
04:11:30.870 --> 04:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
specifically that's that's
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional right I don't think this
 
04:11:35.030 --> 04:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
really violates that but we we really I
 
04:11:36.990 --> 04:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support really having it be
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
left open to the discretion of the of
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
the County Attorney to whether they want
 
04:11:45.670 --> 04:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
they feel should be a Class A or Class B
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
I just think regardless of the policy
 
04:11:50.469 --> 04:11:50.479 align:start position:0%
you should pick one um whe that's
 
04:11:53.109 --> 04:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
stealing dogs are assaulting people at
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
the campaign workers you know at just
 
04:11:56.960 --> 04:11:58.109 align:start position:0%
the campaign workers you know at just
just

04:11:58.109 --> 04:11:58.119 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
a that that's something to keep in mind
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
um I think what happened in Windham
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
particularly is I I am shocked that such
 
04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
a a situation A minor
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
who's 15-year-old kid can be assaulted
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
by an adult in front of so many
 
04:12:22.269 --> 04:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
people and you have certain amount of
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
witnesses including someone who suffered
 
04:12:26.469 --> 04:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
you know broken jaw trying to break you
 
04:12:27.870 --> 04:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
know defend the
 
04:12:31.510 --> 04:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
child uh and no one be arrested on site
 
04:12:33.550 --> 04:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
now maybe no harm no follow because the
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
person still eventually indicted I'm not
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
sure they indicted it's going through
 
04:12:40.630 --> 04:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
now I just find I mean so it is kind of
 
04:12:45.229 --> 04:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
concerning that person wasn't arrested
 
04:12:45.239 --> 04:12:46.830 align:start position:0%
concerning that person wasn't arrested
right

04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:12:49.269 --> 04:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
away I know that what I do know about
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
the facts that the person was defendant
 
04:12:55.309 --> 04:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
was local residence as well maybe there
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
some I don't want to speak to the police
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just very surprised that person
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't arrested for a violent crime if
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
this was a domestic violence case would
 
04:13:07.510 --> 04:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:10.109 --> 04:13:10.119 align:start position:0%
minor I again I'm I'm just concerned how
 
04:13:11.630 --> 04:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
that happened but that's that's really a
 
04:13:13.630 --> 04:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
police practices
 
04:13:16.229 --> 04:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
situation and some of the maybe should
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
be looked into and why what what
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
occurred and why was there no wrestling
 
04:13:19.520 --> 04:13:22.790 align:start position:0%
occurred and why was there no wrestling
on

04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.910 --> 04:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
site I'm not a police officer but I
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.630 --> 04:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
issue Mr chair I can introduce a bill
 
04:13:34.510 --> 04:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
upstairs you don't need to this do
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.030 --> 04:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
so when I'm the voting you're free to I
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
mean all right I just want to say that I
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%

04:13:48.630 --> 04:13:48.640 align:start position:0%
like it's be unanimous anyway I love you
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%

04:13:50.600 --> 04:13:53.189 align:start position:0%
I would love you but I understand that's
not

04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:59.309 --> 04:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.150 --> 04:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
it representative KN said he
 
04:14:03.160 --> 04:14:04.670 align:start position:0%
it representative KN said he
[Music]

04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:08.630 --> 04:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
you I'm really I I want to say that I'm
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
shocked at this story but I'm not it's
 
04:14:13.269 --> 04:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
sadly something that I've been hearing
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
ing from other residents that this sh
 
04:14:19.630 --> 04:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
this situation shs A light on our police
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
State Police protocol and procedures and
 
04:14:25.389 --> 04:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
how they're not being followed and I
 
04:14:28.790 --> 04:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
mean this could happen to any one of us
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
we could be assaulted our kids could be
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
assaulted and we call the cops and they
 
04:14:38.109 --> 04:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
do nothing and what world is that okay
 
04:14:42.070 --> 04:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
this this uh obviously this bill doesn't
 
04:14:44.229 --> 04:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
fix police Pro protocol and procedures
 
04:14:46.750 --> 04:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
from being followed
 
04:14:49.830 --> 04:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
but I think the testimony that we we
 
04:14:52.349 --> 04:14:52.359 align:start position:0%
heard and the bills we've heard prior on
 
04:14:54.950 --> 04:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
streamlining Pro police procedure really
 
04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
need our work we really need to
 
04:15:01.870 --> 04:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
respect um our citizens and in the fact
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
that make sure making sure that our
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system is working for
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
us like if they're not showing up when a
 
04:15:11.950 --> 04:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
kid gets
 
04:15:14.790 --> 04:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
assaulted what's the point of them we
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
need police that protect us this is
 
04:15:22.510 --> 04:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
outrageous and I I mean this again I I
 
04:15:25.229 --> 04:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
can't stress how enough that when people
 
04:15:27.149 --> 04:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
say oh this might not happen in my town
 
04:15:30.590 --> 04:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
oh we have great police here in our city
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
whatever I want to know where I go
 
04:15:36.030 --> 04:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere in New Hampshire that I can
 
04:15:40.590 --> 04:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
call the police if I am being the like
 
04:15:42.510 --> 04:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
you know assault whatever have you I
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
want to know that they're following a a
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
police procedure this is this is scary I
 
04:15:51.269 --> 04:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
think everybody in this room should
 
04:15:56.349 --> 04:15:56.359 align:start position:0%
should should be very very concerned um
 
04:15:58.830 --> 04:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
just for clarification purposes I don't
 
04:16:02.269 --> 04:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
believe that the police didn't respond I
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
believe they were on they were
 
04:16:08.309 --> 04:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
physically at the the voting board what
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
happened was they my understanding was
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
that they because the police officer on
 
04:16:16.710 --> 04:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
that was pres did not see what happened
 
04:16:18.349 --> 04:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
that they claimed there was no they were
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
unable to make an arrest at that time so
 
04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's a little I mean it's not they will
 
04:16:26.349 --> 04:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
call and then they just we're not going
 
04:16:28.590 --> 04:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
to show off that that is a little
 
04:16:31.429 --> 04:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
different I just I have a question uh
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
chair since you're a lawyer I don't know
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
if you can help me with this so let's
 
04:16:38.670 --> 04:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
say 10 people are eyewitnesses they say
 
04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
this guy over here punched a 15-year-old
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
in the face and the cops didn't see it
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
the cops just they don't arrest the guy
 
04:16:47.790 --> 04:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
like what what is the usual thing that
 
04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
happens then well my understanding and
 
04:16:56.109 --> 04:16:56.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not giving anyone legal
 
04:16:58.870 --> 04:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
advice if an officer believes that
 
04:17:01.229 --> 04:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
there's probable cause that a crime has
 
04:17:05.870 --> 04:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
occurred and that crime is is above a I
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
think a Class A Miss it's a Class A Miss
 
04:17:08.760 --> 04:17:10.309 align:start position:0%
think a Class A Miss it's a Class A Miss
higher

04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:17:13.630 --> 04:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
then they they they can arrest a person
 
04:17:14.710 --> 04:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
now they would base it on the
 
04:17:17.550 --> 04:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
credibility of you know if 15 people
 
04:17:19.109 --> 04:17:19.119 align:start position:0%
tell me the same thing I didn't see what
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
happened I would think it would be very
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
difficult for that that many people to
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
organize such a elaborate lie that quick
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
I just it's all about a valuing
 
04:17:31.149 --> 04:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
situation you have someone who's
 
04:17:33.109 --> 04:17:33.119 align:start position:0%
bleeding you it was clearly visible
 
04:17:34.830 --> 04:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
evidence that a violent altercation
 
04:17:38.349 --> 04:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
occurred it was really a matter of who
 
04:17:39.290 --> 04:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
did what
 
04:17:39.300 --> 04:17:40.750 align:start position:0%
did what
[Music]

04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
so you I just thank you for trying to
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
explain I just want the record to show
 
04:17:47.830 --> 04:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
that this is really concerning in our
 
04:17:52.229 --> 04:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
state and I've heard this I I myself um
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
you know had some teenagers down my
 
04:17:58.149 --> 04:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
street and they were screaming and I I
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
went over them I'm like what's going on
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
here and they said there's somebody
 
04:18:04.109 --> 04:18:04.119 align:start position:0%
coming after us with a baseball bat okay
 
04:18:07.389 --> 04:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
I called 911 this is a true story they
 
04:18:09.550 --> 04:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
never showed up I called them again they
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
never showed I mean like I don't know
 
04:18:13.550 --> 04:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
04:18:14.990 --> 04:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I wanted to be in this
 
04:18:18.950 --> 04:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee there is a real uh breakdown
 
04:18:22.109 --> 04:18:22.119 align:start position:0%
of communication and response to our
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
criminal just our police I I don't know
 
04:18:25.830 --> 04:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
what's happening but I think this is all
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
this is a really red flag for all of us
 
04:18:30.750 --> 04:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
this story and I just want to highlight
 
04:18:33.309 --> 04:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
it it's it's very important because if
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
the police aren't protecting us what are
 
04:18:39.309 --> 04:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
they doing and let's just clarification
 
04:18:42.429 --> 04:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
to the the public when we say the police
 
04:18:44.550 --> 04:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
this involve
 
04:18:47.229 --> 04:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
Windham not I'm not saying that Windham
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
has a problem with how they operate just
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
this isn't this wasn't a state police
 
04:18:53.670 --> 04:18:53.680 align:start position:0%
offer and same thing I just want to make
 
04:18:53.680 --> 04:18:55.950 align:start position:0%
offer and same thing I just want to make
sure

04:18:55.950 --> 04:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:19:01.389 --> 04:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
night this isn't a not not every
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
Department repres I see put your hand
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
up believe at one point you are have
 
04:19:10.109 --> 04:19:10.119 align:start position:0%
experienced in law enforcement I would
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.590 --> 04:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
can ask but I'm getting close to having
 
04:19:18.030 --> 04:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
to go to work and I think we're just
 
04:19:20.030 --> 04:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're just getting way off track
 
04:19:20.040 --> 04:19:21.910 align:start position:0%
we're just getting way off track
here

04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay is that is that what you wish to
 
04:19:27.189 --> 04:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
say that's what I would say I think we
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on uh this the
 
04:19:31.710 --> 04:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
bill and the police matter I think are
 
04:19:33.870 --> 04:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
two different things and we're talking
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
about the bill and we should just deal
 
04:19:36.359 --> 04:19:37.189 align:start position:0%
about the bill and we should just deal
with

04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:19:40.670 --> 04:19:40.680 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
04:19:44.349 --> 04:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
pesia Thunder
 
04:19:48.389 --> 04:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
no I just wanted to say that we need to
 
04:19:51.630 --> 04:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.429 --> 04:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
bill whether we like it or don't like it
 
04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
because we were not there we don't know
 
04:19:59.149 --> 04:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
what they saw what was done and it you
 
04:20:04.950 --> 04:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:04.960 --> 04:20:07.070 align:start position:0%

04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
see seeing no further hands raised the
 
04:20:11.910 --> 04:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
the matter will be put to question the
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%

04:22:35.630 --> 04:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.640 --> 04:22:38.389 align:start position:0%

04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
screen
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
I no
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
idea when everyone votes the picture
 
04:22:46.830 --> 04:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
comes up on that screen this one yes
 
04:22:49.630 --> 04:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
that you can set the zoom to different
 
04:22:51.630 --> 04:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
features whoever is
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
speaking uh will get the big screen I
 
04:22:56.510 --> 04:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
have mind set I to see everybody there's
 
04:22:59.349 --> 04:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
a gall or speaker yeah yes what I'm
 
04:23:02.750 --> 04:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
saying is when we're taking the vote I'm
 
04:23:04.189 --> 04:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
not seeing the
 
04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
picture the face of the person who's V
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
if it you I am
 
04:23:13.349 --> 04:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
watching I can see everyone on my screen
 
04:23:15.870 --> 04:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
as well you notice my little pause for a
 
04:23:16.990 --> 04:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
second I
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
was there was a representative who had
 
04:23:21.950 --> 04:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
the camera on waiting for the body to
 
04:23:24.920 --> 04:23:24.930 align:start position:0%

a
 
04:24:32.229 --> 04:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
right we I believe we EXA that
 
04:24:35.309 --> 04:24:35.319 align:start position:0%
in on Friday and it's all set I don't
 
04:24:37.109 --> 04:24:37.119 align:start position:0%
believe there's any outstanding exective
 
04:24:40.590 --> 04:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
sessions on Friday I don't wasn't there
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:48.109 --> 04:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
remember that we asked that it not that
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
we hold it until Monday because we
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
didn't all have the amendment and it was
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
a strong amendment that was 307 307 we
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:12.910 --> 04:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
you one thing we should do
 
04:25:14.990 --> 04:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start the public hearings
 
04:25:17.550 --> 04:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
one thing we should do when we send out
 
04:25:18.910 --> 04:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
the Amendments they all go to your
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
legislative email if you have a
 
04:25:23.590 --> 04:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
preferred email maybe we create a
 
04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
preferred email to send the amendments
 
04:25:28.469 --> 04:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
to if it's not your legislative email I
 
04:25:30.590 --> 04:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't that would be more helpful uh so
 
04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
represent I leave it to you maybe
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
gather everyone's PR
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
email um in your pocket and I the same
 
04:25:43.109 --> 04:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
mine and maybe
 
04:25:45.790 --> 04:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
a master what you want to call we'll
 
04:25:47.550 --> 04:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
make one email so and we'll give that to
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant to forward them
 
04:25:53.229 --> 04:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
to that might be okay we'll
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
do printed uh copy there still be
 
04:25:58.109 --> 04:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
printed copies here but I'm just saying
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's the people um the members partip
 
04:26:03.389 --> 04:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
remotely aren't always receiving and
 
04:26:05.870 --> 04:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
that legislative email I mean gets
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes with emails that if we try to
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
look for it just
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
I have a legal question for
 
04:26:19.469 --> 04:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
you ask may
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
I you're
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
guilty we we are what's the question
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
send me a reference to House Bill 419 on
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
the assaults at the campaign offices yes
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the police officers will
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
not make an arrest because when they get
 
04:26:37.469 --> 04:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
into the courthouse and the judge says
 
04:26:39.309 --> 04:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
were you present and saw
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
this they say no I wasn't and that that
 
04:26:44.030 --> 04:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
can kill
 
04:26:47.790 --> 04:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
a that might explain why why they it
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like they they followed up on the
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
investigation let's get because they
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
eventually didn't make an
 
04:26:52.920 --> 04:26:58.630 align:start position:0%
eventually didn't make an
arrest

04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.990 --> 04:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
righten to just
 
04:27:03.550 --> 04:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
discuss and she would like to let you
 
04:27:06.670 --> 04:27:06.680 align:start position:0%
know that DRS she does not believe
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
they one email
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
list other than to send out that's why
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're all
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
going well the zoom invit I'm talking
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
about the Amendments that we have to the
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee right she's saying they're not
 
04:27:23.150 --> 04:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:23.160 --> 04:27:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
send we'll clarify that all right let
 
04:27:31.229 --> 04:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
let's get started at this time we are
 
04:27:33.070 --> 04:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
opening the public hearing on House Bill
 
04:27:35.710 --> 04:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
526 relative to the fine and the sale
 
04:27:38.670 --> 04:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
the sale or possession of cannabis and
 
04:27:40.990 --> 04:27:41.000 align:start position:0%

simultaneously
 
04:27:44.229 --> 04:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
and that is relative to the penalties
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
drugs the time constraints we are going
 
04:27:54.750 --> 04:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
to limit testimony for uh each bill for
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
members of the public to one minute uh
 
04:27:59.710 --> 04:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the uh
 
04:28:01.590 --> 04:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives that are introducing the
 
04:28:13.269 --> 04:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognize
 
04:28:14.880 --> 04:28:19.950 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognize
representative

04:28:19.950 --> 04:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:19.960 --> 04:28:25.990 align:start position:0%
 
abson

04:28:25.990 --> 04:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:28.510 --> 04:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
introduce a you being recognize
 
04:28:30.790 --> 04:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
introduce uh House Bill
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
526 all right thank you Mr chair members
 
04:28:34.870 --> 04:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm going to try and
 
04:28:37.349 --> 04:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
speak as quickly as I can um so that you
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
can get through with your work House
 
04:28:43.389 --> 04:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 526 is intended um the bill that
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't actually uh legalize or Rel
 
04:28:48.030 --> 04:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
legalize uh sale or possession of
 
04:28:50.670 --> 04:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana the intent of the bill uh is
 
04:28:54.109 --> 04:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
to reduce the fine to $1 per gram uh
 
04:28:57.109 --> 04:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
which would be if if it were viewed as a
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
tax it would be paying about the same
 
04:29:01.189 --> 04:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
amount as what you would pay in Maine
 
04:29:04.590 --> 04:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
and other New England states um
 
04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have uh uh we normally
 
04:29:09.109 --> 04:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
don't talk about the Senate but being
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
realistic the Senate uh majority right
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
now would not vote to Rel legalize
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
personal amounts of marijuana right now
 
04:29:19.149 --> 04:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
so I think this is probably as far as we
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
we could go as a house in reducing the
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
penalty or or bringing the penalties in
 
04:29:26.429 --> 04:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
line with something that that that I
 
04:29:29.830 --> 04:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
think is more realistic um $1 per gram
 
04:29:31.750 --> 04:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
of course for a half an ounce would be a
 
04:29:35.309 --> 04:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
$14 fine one of the the the problems we
 
04:29:37.349 --> 04:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
run into is someone goes to a medical
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana dispensary and their ID card
 
04:29:42.030 --> 04:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
is either they're waiting for it it's
 
04:29:43.710 --> 04:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
insired it's from out ofate I know that
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
there's another out ofate bill out ofate
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana ID card bill coming in
 
04:29:53.149 --> 04:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
um and you have patients who who require
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis in order to deal with any
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
number of symptoms um sometimes they
 
04:30:00.109 --> 04:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
people change doctors and the doctor
 
04:30:03.189 --> 04:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
gives them a different um same uh
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
diagnosis but a different prognosis and
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
they they prescribe uh opioids or
 
04:30:11.149 --> 04:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
Oxycontin or something that that may be
 
04:30:13.990 --> 04:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit excess where uh medical use
 
04:30:16.269 --> 04:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
of marijuana may be preferable but
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
another problem that I I encountered
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
when going through medical marijuana
 
04:30:23.710 --> 04:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
statutes is if if a cashier
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
sells uh marijuana over the counter to
 
04:30:29.349 --> 04:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
someone um I believe the penalty is six
 
04:30:31.630 --> 04:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
years in prison and a felony if the
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
person's um ID card is expired or out of
 
04:30:37.870 --> 04:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
state um and I thought that was a little
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
bit of not just a little bit excessive
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's crazy
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
um just missing a factor detail I
 
04:30:48.950 --> 04:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
thought it was uh um pretty bizarre um I
 
04:30:50.670 --> 04:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
was contacted I think the rest of us
 
04:30:53.469 --> 04:30:53.479 align:start position:0%
were contacted by um
 
04:30:56.590 --> 04:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS and they they did bring this this
 
04:30:59.469 --> 04:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
issue up that it is potentially a felony
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
for for selling this over the counter um
 
04:31:04.239 --> 04:31:05.950 align:start position:0%
for for selling this over the counter um
and

04:31:05.950 --> 04:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:09.229 --> 04:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
um so um I'm going back and forth with
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
legislative Services right now to update
 
04:31:14.710 --> 04:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
the the the the the details of the bill
 
04:31:18.870 --> 04:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
but um the the the house last session
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
passed a measure to Rel legalize
 
04:31:22.269 --> 04:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
personal amounts of marijuana and I
 
04:31:24.269 --> 04:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
think it passed by a margin of almost 5
 
04:31:26.389 --> 04:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
to one knowing full well that it wasn't
 
04:31:27.910 --> 04:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to make it through the Senate and
 
04:31:30.630 --> 04:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be signed into law um
 
04:31:33.309 --> 04:31:33.319 align:start position:0%
which is unfortunate um we do spend an
 
04:31:35.109 --> 04:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of money as a country
 
04:31:37.870 --> 04:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
trying to enforc marijuana laws um there
 
04:31:39.830 --> 04:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
are still a lot of arrests going on we
 
04:31:42.269 --> 04:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
do have police coming up saying you know
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
almost every week saying we can't arrest
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
our way out of the problem marijuana
 
04:31:49.389 --> 04:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
policy project has listed 10 reasons why
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana prohibition doesn't work um
 
04:31:54.269 --> 04:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
but the main one is that it it's
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
contributed to a breakdown in respect
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
for the rule of law every time Congress
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
has stepped up uh drug prohibition since
 
04:32:02.910 --> 04:32:02.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
1967 when it started under Lyndon
 
04:32:06.910 --> 04:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
Johnson I think is when the national
 
04:32:08.750 --> 04:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
announcement was made every time they've
 
04:32:11.070 --> 04:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
stepped it up crime has gotten worse
 
04:32:14.109 --> 04:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
drug use is tripled uh death rates are
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed and uh prohibition
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
especially marijuana prohibition uh gets
 
04:32:21.389 --> 04:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
in the way of harm reduction which are
 
04:32:23.229 --> 04:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
generally efforts to minimize the harm
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
caused by uh drug use um the loss of
 
04:32:30.429 --> 04:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
civil liberties the 80,000 SWAT raids
 
04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
into people's homes every year um as a
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
state I believe somebody put a figure
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
out of about $45 million a year in terms
 
04:32:42.309 --> 04:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
of lost revenue and money that we're
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
spending on arrests prosecution and
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
incarceration um obviously the
 
04:32:50.790 --> 04:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
environmental problems that that result
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
um the loss of control um that the sales
 
04:32:58.030 --> 04:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
of of uh drugs when they're made illegal
 
04:33:00.590 --> 04:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
or alcohol or or any type of prohibition
 
04:33:03.309 --> 04:33:03.319 align:start position:0%
gambling prohibition gun prohibition uh
 
04:33:03.319 --> 04:33:04.510 align:start position:0%
gambling prohibition gun prohibition uh
alcohol

04:33:04.510 --> 04:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
04:33:06.629 --> 04:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
prohibition um and doing research on
 
04:33:10.990 --> 04:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
Article Five um by the time uh alcohol
 
04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
prohibition was the only amendment
 
04:33:14.750 --> 04:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
passed to the Constitution through State
 
04:33:16.629 --> 04:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
ratifying conventions and it's
 
04:33:18.150 --> 04:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
interesting going back on the history of
 
04:33:19.551 --> 04:33:19.561 align:start position:0%
the debate that they found that it was
 
04:33:19.561 --> 04:33:20.629 align:start position:0%
the debate that they found that it was
so

04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:24.189 --> 04:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
obvious um by the early 1930s that
 
04:33:26.349 --> 04:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
prohibition had been alcohol prohibition
 
04:33:28.150 --> 04:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
had been a complete disaster and here we
 
04:33:31.070 --> 04:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
are with marijuana prohibition fa facing
 
04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
the same problem or the same same crisis
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
um making uh marijuana illegal tends to
 
04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
drive people away to other um Alcohol
 
04:33:46.830 --> 04:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
and Other Drugs uh marijuana Prohibition
 
04:33:49.590 --> 04:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
in particular has caused more problems
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
more arrests has led to uh
 
04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
disproportionate sentences for poor
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
people and people of color about um I'm
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
told that 88% of people serving time
 
04:34:01.949 --> 04:34:01.959 align:start position:0%
behind bars for for drug violations are
 
04:34:04.750 --> 04:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
for mere possession of marijuana and
 
04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
85% are black Latino or American Indian
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
so it disproportionately hits people of
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
color much harder than any anything else
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
um this is this has been a policy or
 
04:34:20.949 --> 04:34:20.959 align:start position:0%
this has been a policy that has uh cut
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
across party lines for a long time and
 
04:34:29.551 --> 04:34:29.561 align:start position:0%
um in most of New England at least it's
 
04:34:31.269 --> 04:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
it's almost Universal and certainly
 
04:34:33.551 --> 04:34:33.561 align:start position:0%
among younger people that that it makes
 
04:34:35.670 --> 04:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely no sense to see people's
 
04:34:38.910 --> 04:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
lives being ruined um for this so the
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
intent is not to make the policy change
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
because of both federal law and because
 
04:34:45.910 --> 04:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the condition in the Senate um it's
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
simply to reduce the penalty to $1 a
 
04:34:50.949 --> 04:34:50.959 align:start position:0%
gram uh which is certainly a compromis
 
04:34:53.150 --> 04:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
position um the intent was that the
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
revenue would be collected by the town
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
or that the dispensary would simply pay
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
the pay the fine to the town um allowing
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
the town to use the money for improved
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh funding for
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
EMT uh resources but that would be a
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
decision to be made by the people of
 
04:35:12.551 --> 04:35:12.561 align:start position:0%
that particular Town um
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh I think that this bill could probably
 
04:35:18.510 --> 04:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
pass on the floor pretty easily um as is
 
04:35:21.990 --> 04:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
but I I think as much as The house's
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
position has been that that we should
 
04:35:28.750 --> 04:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
Rel legalize personal use um that just
 
04:35:30.269 --> 04:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
isn't the position of the Senate right
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
now so I think this is a this is a
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
compromise to try and and and see if the
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
something representative pakis you
 
04:35:41.039 --> 04:35:45.269 align:start position:0%
something representative pakis you
recognized

04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:50.800 --> 04:35:50.810 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:50.810 --> 04:35:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:35:58.470 --> 04:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
04:36:03.510 --> 04:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
question how how does a a person or
 
04:36:07.230 --> 04:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
place that sells medical marijuana give
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
the marijuana to the people without a
 
04:36:09.920 --> 04:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
the marijuana to the people without a
cat

04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
cat
 
04:36:14.750 --> 04:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
it in theory they don't but there's a
 
04:36:17.629 --> 04:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
bill coming over to deal with the same
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
issue from your question what happens if
 
04:36:21.789 --> 04:36:21.799 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in with an outof State
 
04:36:23.510 --> 04:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana ID card or what if
 
04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
someone has an expired ID card or what
 
04:36:27.789 --> 04:36:27.799 align:start position:0%
if someone shows up um a
 
04:36:29.269 --> 04:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
disproportionate number of people are
 
04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
disabled and they they come in uh it's a
 
04:36:34.349 --> 04:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
very difficult trip to the dispensary
 
04:36:37.109 --> 04:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
and they don't have the with
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
them U they would not be able to
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
probably would not be able to buy it but
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
if the cashier recognizes that person
 
04:36:50.230 --> 04:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
and believes that they have uh a medical
 
04:36:53.429 --> 04:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
condition uh they would be risking
 
04:36:57.429 --> 04:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
prosecution for selling marijuana for
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
for medical use to someone who has a
 
04:36:59.279 --> 04:37:04.830 align:start position:0%
for medical use to someone who has a
legitimate

04:37:04.830 --> 04:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:07.150 --> 04:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
condition second
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
question represent P you recognize for a
 
04:37:09.799 --> 04:37:12.150 align:start position:0%
question represent P you recognize for a
followup

04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
followup
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh it was to my understanding when
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
we made the rules for the medical
 
04:37:19.439 --> 04:37:21.230 align:start position:0%
we made the rules for the medical
center

04:37:21.230 --> 04:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
center
 
04:37:25.470 --> 04:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
and the people that bought and owned the
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
build businesses agreed that these laws
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
were put in place for that reason so
 
04:37:35.869 --> 04:37:35.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
don't understand why we want to give up
 
04:37:42.789 --> 04:37:42.799 align:start position:0%
that fact that that cashier would go to
 
04:37:46.150 --> 04:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
jail for six years she's supposed to be
 
04:37:50.510 --> 04:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
following our laws have you had any of
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
them u i I lost some of your question
 
04:37:59.070 --> 04:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
due to um due to uh signal loss um but
 
04:38:02.310 --> 04:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
it it's it's a matter of represent P do

thank you you still May respond to the
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the question all right I I I just
 
04:38:20.109 --> 04:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
believe that the the penalty we wouldn't
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
do this for any other business uh as far
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
as I know we wouldn't go to this excess
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we certainly wouldn't want to uh put
 
04:38:30.470 --> 04:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
a a cashier who's selling I don't know
 
04:38:33.789 --> 04:38:33.799 align:start position:0%
tobacco cigarettes or or or even beer to
 
04:38:36.429 --> 04:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
somebody who has an ID that looks like a
 
04:38:39.670 --> 04:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
legitimate ID but later on in court
 
04:38:41.551 --> 04:38:41.561 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody on the jury says oh this
 
04:38:44.150 --> 04:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
is a fake ID or here's an expired ID or
 
04:38:46.029 --> 04:38:46.039 align:start position:0%
or who knows what or here's an ID and it
 
04:38:47.590 --> 04:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't quite look like the person or
 
04:38:49.949 --> 04:38:49.959 align:start position:0%
somebody misuses an ID the cashier
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
should not be put in Jeopardy thank you
 
04:38:54.750 --> 04:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
jail time at
 
04:38:58.070 --> 04:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
you representative tro thank you Mr
 
04:39:03.510 --> 04:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
04:39:07.269 --> 04:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh the rsas that
 
04:39:10.510 --> 04:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
presently say uh it's a felony if you
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
are selling over the counter and the
 
04:39:14.869 --> 04:39:14.879 align:start position:0%
idea is that addressed in your bill
 
04:39:16.349 --> 04:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of crossout here I haven't
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
found that yet so I was contact I the
 
04:39:21.629 --> 04:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
intent was what I explained to
 
04:39:23.670 --> 04:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
legislative Services was the intent was
 
04:39:25.590 --> 04:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
that for absolutely all purposes in the
 
04:39:27.910 --> 04:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
state any any sale or possession would
 
04:39:30.109 --> 04:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
be Li reduced to a $1
 
04:39:33.150 --> 04:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
fine um however I was contacted by DHHS
 
04:39:34.910 --> 04:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
and they said well this bill wouldn't
 
04:39:36.510 --> 04:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
have that impact so I went back to
 
04:39:39.270 --> 04:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
legislative Services I've gotten a an
 
04:39:40.830 --> 04:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
amendment back and we're going back and
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%

04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
just got back from legislative services
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%

email inbox for this morning so if I
 
04:39:52.990 --> 04:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
have to come up with another amendment
 
04:39:54.910 --> 04:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
to to further clarify that I'm willing
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
to do the
 
04:40:03.590 --> 04:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%

04:40:19.750 --> 04:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what concerns me
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
is the uh and has for some time
 
04:40:28.150 --> 04:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
is products are infused with
 
04:40:28.160 --> 04:40:29.430 align:start position:0%
is products are infused with
tetrahydrate

04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
tetrahydrate
 
04:40:32.030 --> 04:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
canol they're they're wreaking havoc
 
04:40:34.030 --> 04:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
with children in Colorado and other
 
04:40:36.590 --> 04:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
places because they're it's it's not
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
like marijuana somebody has an ounce of
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana on the table a child is un
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
likely to eat it if a if a person passes
 
04:40:47.550 --> 04:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
out on their couch and there's a bowl
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
full of uh infused gummy bears the kid
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
will eat them all and the kids kids have
 
04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
gone into uh actually one senator from
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
Colorado told me it could ended up in a
 
04:41:02.948 --> 04:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
coma from there do you do you uh how do
 
04:41:06.510 --> 04:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
you propose to deal with the infused
 
04:41:08.310 --> 04:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
products that might end up in the hands
 
04:41:08.320 --> 04:41:09.150 align:start position:0%
products that might end up in the hands
of

04:41:09.150 --> 04:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.070 --> 04:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh that problem can only be solved by
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
either Rel legalizing or or completely
 
04:41:22.910 --> 04:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing marijuana um and that's
 
04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I'm trying to do
 
04:41:26.110 --> 04:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
with the bill facing of course the
 
04:41:29.550 --> 04:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
problems we have with the Senate um it
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
if when we legalized alcohol in 1933
 
04:41:35.590 --> 04:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
until that all through alcohol
 
04:41:37.310 --> 04:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
prohibition people were going blind off
 
04:41:40.590 --> 04:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
of of bathtub Jin people were the the
 
04:41:42.750 --> 04:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of Meth ethanol that was uh
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
existing in illegal alcohol was alcohol
 
04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition was causing more problems
 
04:41:50.350 --> 04:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
than it was solving by far and certainly
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana prohibition is causing a lot
 
04:41:55.868 --> 04:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
of those problems if the sale or
 
04:41:58.470 --> 04:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
possession is illegal already you've
 
04:42:00.510 --> 04:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
already kind of crossed that line we
 
04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
want to
 
04:42:04.708 --> 04:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
have or majority of members of the House
 
04:42:06.350 --> 04:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
want to have
 
04:42:08.670 --> 04:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
marijuana the the the sale and
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
distribution needed to be uh ulated and
 
04:42:15.310 --> 04:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
legal so that it's it's reputable
 
04:42:17.310 --> 04:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
businesses supplying these things not
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
illegal suppliers one of my friends is
 
04:42:21.430 --> 04:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
Chucky Rosa of Chucky's fight and his
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
eldest son died not from the marijuana
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
that he smoked but because it was
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
illegal I believe it was fentel was was
 
04:42:33.470 --> 04:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
was put into it and he didn't know that
 
04:42:36.110 --> 04:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
there was fentanyl in it and he he died
 
04:42:38.070 --> 04:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
not from the marijuana of course but
 
04:42:41.310 --> 04:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
from what it was laced with if marijuana
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
is Rel legalized if the supply is Rel
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
legalized um then that would be much
 
04:42:50.948 --> 04:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
harder it is still possible to lace
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco or alcohol or anything else with
 
04:42:56.910 --> 04:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
illegal substances but it wouldn't be
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
done by the manufacturer and it wouldn't
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
be done by reputable businesses it would
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
be done by presumably someone giving you
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
say rolled tobacco and then people
 
04:43:09.750 --> 04:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes put other drugs into tobacco
 
04:43:12.670 --> 04:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
but it's just it's much less common
 
04:43:19.788 --> 04:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
legal representative
 
04:43:25.150 --> 04:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
testerman thank you Mr chairman thanks
 
04:43:27.430 --> 04:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative Aon for taking my
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
question you
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
dodg uh representative Hopper's
 
04:43:36.750 --> 04:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
question represent Testament we don't
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
speak to the intent of
 
04:43:42.910 --> 04:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
members gummy bears
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
infused with marijuana in the case that
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony on are totally legal
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
because they're marijuana byproduct in
 
04:43:57.070 --> 04:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
Colorado uh those are available uh you
 
04:43:59.430 --> 04:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
know to purchase on the open market it's
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
a valid question and I want you to
 
04:44:04.708 --> 04:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
answer this is is if there
 
04:44:08.030 --> 04:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
are somebody leaves a bowl of gummy
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
bears out and gets to them
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh yeah what's your
 
04:44:17.070 --> 04:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility I mean I you legalize
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
your total legalization makes no sense
 
04:44:23.470 --> 04:44:23.480 align:start position:0%
when when marijuana today rather than be
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
5% like it was you know way back when in
 
04:44:29.788 --> 04:44:29.798 align:start position:0%
the 60s be up to 70 80% so I I want to
 
04:44:33.310 --> 04:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
know you why you're trying to legalize
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:42.030 --> 04:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
controlate the wi either
 
04:44:44.430 --> 04:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a hard
 
04:44:48.030 --> 04:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
it resp to the question not the debate
 
04:44:49.830 --> 04:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
part yeah I'm trying not to get into
 
04:44:51.708 --> 04:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
bait you could have gummy bears that are
 
04:44:54.670 --> 04:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
just you know regular gummy bears with
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
sugar like the ones we got as kids and
 
04:44:58.990 --> 04:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
anybody could lace those with anything
 
04:45:01.788 --> 04:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
right now and and when I was a kid there
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
were when we went uh you know door to
 
04:45:06.510 --> 04:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
door Todo uh for
 
04:45:08.150 --> 04:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
trick-or-treating um we had to throw
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
away a lot of candy that we couldn't be
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
sure about because of the risk of crazy
 
04:45:14.310 --> 04:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
people out there who would lace just
 
04:45:17.948 --> 04:45:17.958 align:start position:0%
existing candy or you know for adults
 
04:45:20.310 --> 04:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
alcohol alcoholic beverage sometimes get
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
laced or spiked or just you know uh the
 
04:45:26.190 --> 04:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
punch bowl and back in high school I'm
 
04:45:27.550 --> 04:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
not sure if that happened at your high
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
school but it it certainly happened at
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
college and high school back when I was
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
a Youngster people do Spike substances
 
04:45:38.110 --> 04:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
like that but it's it's harder to do it
 
04:45:40.270 --> 04:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
if if it's legal if you have a legal
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
product like tobacco or or or or soda or
 
04:45:46.230 --> 04:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
something like that because soda is
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
legal you're getting a 2 L bottle of
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
something and uh you open it you can see
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
it being opened and it's it's pretty
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
hard for somebody to to spike it at that
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
point whereas illegal substances are
 
04:45:59.390 --> 04:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
just kind of very very informal um and
 
04:46:02.350 --> 04:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
they just kind of get rolled manually my
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
my preference would be that that the
 
04:46:06.430 --> 04:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
supply of substances should all be
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
legalized um or Rel legalized because we
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't want things spiked we don't want
 
04:46:12.750 --> 04:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
fentanyl put in things we don't want
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
illegal substances or dangerous
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
substances put in um that aren't even
 
04:46:17.040 --> 04:46:20.070 align:start position:0%
substances put in um that aren't even
properly

04:46:20.070 --> 04:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
labeled representative Klein
 
04:46:26.030 --> 04:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
Knight thank you chair and thank you
 
04:46:27.788 --> 04:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:46:29.628 --> 04:46:29.638 align:start position:0%
and bringing forth this bill I think we
 
04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
have a major lack of misunderstanding
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes to regulating cannabis to
 
04:46:37.788 --> 04:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
make it safer so it's not laced with
 
04:46:42.310 --> 04:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
things and would you believe that I am a
 
04:46:46.430 --> 04:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
medical uh card carrier and this is what
 
04:46:49.470 --> 04:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
gummies look like it's in the in
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
medicine bottle would you believe that
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
that is how they package it there's
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
labels there's warnings there's not a
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
bowl of gummies left out and it's
 
04:47:02.708 --> 04:47:02.718 align:start position:0%
regulated completely there's nothing
 
04:47:02.718 --> 04:47:05.628 align:start position:0%
regulated completely there's nothing
added

04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.230 --> 04:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
in uh yes I would believe that I know
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
that the that that really is the reason
 
04:47:14.430 --> 04:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
why um some conservatives who don't want
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
to legalize uh oh don't want to legalize
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
the use would still Rel legalize the
 
04:47:22.548 --> 04:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
supply in other words the sale and
 
04:47:26.670 --> 04:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
possession than the use represent C mind
 
04:47:35.230 --> 04:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:43.110 --> 04:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
you want me to mute this
 
04:47:45.040 --> 04:47:45.050 align:start position:0%

04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
yes hi um my name is Erica Barz I'm with
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire youth movement and I
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
am speaking in support of both HB 526
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
and HB
 
04:49:23.070 --> 04:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
511 um given that many states have moved
 
04:49:24.948 --> 04:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
to legalize and are making massive
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
profits off of cannabis it's unfair to
 
04:49:29.310 --> 04:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
financially punish other people for it
 
04:49:31.470 --> 04:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
and a fine for cannabis should not
 
04:49:31.480 --> 04:49:32.430 align:start position:0%
and a fine for cannabis should not
exceed

04:49:32.430 --> 04:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
exceed
 
04:49:35.910 --> 04:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
$100 um and I believe that there should
 
04:49:37.948 --> 04:49:37.958 align:start position:0%
be no fine if people are caught with
 
04:49:39.910 --> 04:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis so I support this bill because
 
04:49:44.430 --> 04:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
it minimizes find that they would get
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and as far as uh HP 511 goes one in
 
04:49:51.390 --> 04:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
seven people are serving time in prison
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for a drug offense the
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
average cost per inmate is
 
04:50:00.830 --> 04:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
$35,000 um annually and putting us at
 
04:50:03.310 --> 04:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
the top the top third in the country for
 
04:50:03.320 --> 04:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
the top the top third in the country for
incarceration

04:50:04.910 --> 04:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
04:50:07.030 --> 04:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
expedent um the state of New Hampshire
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
has spent too many tax dollars on
 
04:50:09.990 --> 04:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
imprisoning people and we should be
 
04:50:12.948 --> 04:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
focusing on Rehabilitation and lowering
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
fines because fines tend to put people
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
in a cycle of incarceration because
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
um minute sorry my video cut out
 
04:50:35.430 --> 04:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
um yeah in
 
04:50:38.230 --> 04:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion I support these
 
04:50:44.950 --> 04:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:44.960 --> 04:51:01.670 align:start position:0%

h43 I've seen all people on the list is

now uh Mr chair um Melissa

Staples good
 
04:51:28.948 --> 04:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Melissa Staples I'm
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
the director of the State Police
 
04:51:32.548 --> 04:51:32.558 align:start position:0%
forensic laboratory and I would like to
 
04:51:34.230 --> 04:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
address House Bill
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
511 511 makes the first four convictions
 
04:51:40.390 --> 04:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
for possession of four grams or less of
 
04:51:42.510 --> 04:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
a schedule 1 through four controlled
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
drug a Class B misdemeanor currently a
 
04:51:48.030 --> 04:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
class B felony just to put this in
 
04:51:50.590 --> 04:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
perspective one could have more than 100
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
bags of fentanyl Doses and be under the
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
4 gram limit or about 80 bags of heroin
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
doses someone who may be charged with
 
04:52:00.548 --> 04:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
sale of these items based on the the
 
04:52:02.548 --> 04:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
number of bags could argue the charges
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
down to a misdemeanor if there's no
 
04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
corroborating evidence of a sale for
 
04:52:10.110 --> 04:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
example I wanted to discuss uh the
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
impact on the laboratory of this bill
 
04:52:14.390 --> 04:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
but due to the time limit I'd like to
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
jump ahead to one thing that I think the
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
committee needs to be aware of which is
 
04:52:23.390 --> 04:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is at odds with HB
 
04:52:25.948 --> 04:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
615 which has already been heard by this
 
04:52:28.350 --> 04:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
committee voted all to pass with
 
04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment and referred to the house Ways
 
04:52:33.948 --> 04:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee last week HB 615
 
04:52:36.270 --> 04:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
also amends the same section of the
 
04:52:40.990 --> 04:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
control Drug Act RSA 318 b26
 
04:52:44.070 --> 04:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
section 2A by replacing it with verbage
 
04:52:46.230 --> 04:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
making possession of no specific weight
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
of drug a misdemeanor for the first
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
charge but a class B felony for
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
subsequent violations so HB 615 and this
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
HB 511 both aim to amend the same
 
04:53:01.670 --> 04:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
portion of existing law in different
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
ways so I wanted to point that out to
 
04:53:04.200 --> 04:53:04.910 align:start position:0%
ways so I wanted to point that out to
the

04:53:04.910 --> 04:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:53:07.670 --> 04:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh and if if you would grant
 
04:53:09.070 --> 04:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
me more time I could talk a little bit
 
04:53:10.628 --> 04:53:10.638 align:start position:0%
more about the impact of the laboratory
 
04:53:12.548 --> 04:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 511 but I want to be
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:22.750 --> 04:53:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:26.548 --> 04:53:26.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank Miss I actually didn't
 
04:53:28.390 --> 04:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
have a question for you specifically but
 
04:53:31.070 --> 04:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
I I wasn't able to hear if you were
 
04:53:33.948 --> 04:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
testifying in opposition or support of
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm really testifying just from
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
an informative view uh the department of
 
04:53:42.070 --> 04:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
safety is does not take any particular
 
04:53:44.548 --> 04:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
stance um I can tell you from the
 
04:53:47.390 --> 04:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
laboratory's perspective House Bill 511
 
04:53:49.868 --> 04:53:49.878 align:start position:0%
does prevent several issues for us from
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
a resource
 
04:53:55.230 --> 04:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
standpoint um it would increase
 
04:53:56.590 --> 04:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
significantly increase for example
 
04:53:59.070 --> 04:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
prosecutions in District Courts uh I can
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
tell you when marijuana possession was a
 
04:54:03.670 --> 04:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor the lab received up to
 
04:54:05.868 --> 04:54:05.878 align:start position:0%
almost 2,000 subpoenas a year and spent
 
04:54:08.750 --> 04:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
about 500 hours annually in court that's
 
04:54:10.510 --> 04:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
about 12 and a half weeks of someone
 
04:54:13.270 --> 04:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
full-time hours the number of cases a
 
04:54:15.310 --> 04:54:15.320 align:start position:0%
waiting analysis was was lengthy
 
04:54:17.868 --> 04:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
turnaround time took quite a long time
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
we basically were only able to test the
 
04:54:22.510 --> 04:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
cases we had subpoenas for each month
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
and that was just with one drug being a
 
04:54:26.548 --> 04:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor currently with marijana
 
04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
obession being a misdemeanor a number of
 
04:54:30.070 --> 04:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
subpoenas and court hours has been cut
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
by a third now if we add all scheduled
 
04:54:34.510 --> 04:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
drugs as misdemeanor charges for the
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
first four offenses that Court
 
04:54:38.350 --> 04:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
obligation is going to increase
 
04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
dramatically to meet or even surp pass
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
those previous levels and that's a
 
04:54:44.788 --> 04:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
concern for us as a laboratory because
 
04:54:46.750 --> 04:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
for our analysts are out at court
 
04:54:49.390 --> 04:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
they're not here testing the drugs and
 
04:54:51.590 --> 04:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
so that is one uh potential impact on
 
04:54:54.350 --> 04:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
the laboratory um of house spill 511
 
04:54:58.110 --> 04:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
should that pass um in addition to added
 
04:55:00.190 --> 04:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
analyses that need to be performed for
 
04:55:00.200 --> 04:55:03.190 align:start position:0%
analyses that need to be performed for
possession

04:55:03.190 --> 04:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:03.200 --> 04:55:06.628 align:start position:0%
 
charges

04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.390 --> 04:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
question true have a question thank you
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you uh to the witness for
 
04:55:13.070 --> 04:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
question can you tell me where I would
 
04:55:18.030 --> 04:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
find a listing of schedule 1 through
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
four control drugs you know I personally
 
04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
Googled it the DEA certainly has that
 
04:55:29.310 --> 04:55:29.320 align:start position:0%
list on their website um it's not that
 
04:55:30.910 --> 04:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to come across if you if you
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
simply Google it um essentially schedule
 
04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
one are things like heroin um LSD
 
04:55:40.548 --> 04:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
ecstasy schedule two includes fentanyl
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh Aderall
 
04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
um methamphetamine and those are really
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
our our top drugs are the
 
04:55:48.310 --> 04:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine the fentol and the
 
04:55:50.830 --> 04:55:50.840 align:start position:0%
heroin um schedule one and two Drugs
 
04:55:54.548 --> 04:55:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:57.470 --> 04:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
laboratory other question is thank you
 
04:56:00.430 --> 04:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
Mr J thank you man for taking my
 
04:56:03.830 --> 04:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
followup and um I don't know how many
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
when I I will Google that and how many
 
04:56:08.990 --> 04:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
words am I going to find in those lists
 
04:56:11.230 --> 04:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
that I can't pronounce like
 
04:56:16.310 --> 04:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
thuma TR pan there may be quite a
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
few but as I said uh as far as New
 
04:56:21.070 --> 04:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire goes and and what we're seeing
 
04:56:24.590 --> 04:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
primarily uh fentanyl's number one uh
 
04:56:26.350 --> 04:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
methampetamine is number two and the
 
04:56:27.910 --> 04:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals like the adderal the
 
04:56:30.030 --> 04:56:30.040 align:start position:0%
rellin uh those types of things are a
 
04:56:33.788 --> 04:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
number three drug um beyond that cocaine
 
04:56:35.708 --> 04:56:35.718 align:start position:0%
is further down the list uh but those
 
04:56:37.948 --> 04:56:37.958 align:start position:0%
three are generally the ones that we see
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other questions
 
04:56:45.548 --> 04:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:47.948 --> 04:56:47.958 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:56:53.270 --> 04:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I not to make you
 
04:56:55.990 --> 04:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
go back over this again but I I'm not
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
quite sure that I followed how the
 
04:57:02.510 --> 04:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill would increase the
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
work of the lab um maybe one more time
 
04:57:09.670 --> 04:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
slowly sure absolutely it was freshed as
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
I said
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh let me explain to you just quickly
 
04:57:15.590 --> 04:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
quickly but hopefully slow enough um
 
04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
there's essentially three impacts on the
 
04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
laboratory that I foresee should House
 
04:57:24.910 --> 04:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 511 pass number one uh currently
 
04:57:26.548 --> 04:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
under current law there's no weight
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
limit associated with possession charges
 
04:57:32.190 --> 04:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
if we received a submission of five bags
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
of a white powder for example we can
 
04:57:37.110 --> 04:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
test one confirm heroin and be done with
 
04:57:39.948 --> 04:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
our analysis should this legislation go
 
04:57:41.788 --> 04:57:41.798 align:start position:0%
through through we would now need to
 
04:57:44.190 --> 04:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
obtain a total weight of all of the bags
 
04:57:45.868 --> 04:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
and potentially perform additional
 
04:57:47.830 --> 04:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
analyses on at least some percentage of
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
the packets over the course of the
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
number of requests the lab receives
 
04:57:54.310 --> 04:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
annually this would increase our work
 
04:57:57.270 --> 04:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
lob substantially more analysis means
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
more time for analysts to interpret
 
04:58:01.230 --> 04:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
results all of this impacts our ability
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
to keep Pace with the incoming
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
submissions secondly the one I spoke to
 
04:58:08.470 --> 04:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
earlier is the time commitment for
 
04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
District Court appearances
 
04:58:13.788 --> 04:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
uh our analysts will receive numerous
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
subpoenas every year and we will always
 
04:58:18.628 --> 04:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
appear in court um it's not going to be
 
04:58:19.948 --> 04:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
the thing where you wait and see if we
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
show up we will be there and oftentimes
 
04:58:25.788 --> 04:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
once we arrive these court cases tend to
 
04:58:29.788 --> 04:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
plead out over time the amount of time
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
spent by analysts going around the state
 
04:58:34.948 --> 04:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
to court is very impactful on our
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
ability to perform analyses back here in
 
04:58:40.270 --> 04:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
the lab if you can imagine that uh and
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
so when so many more drugs essentially
 
04:58:46.270 --> 04:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
almost all of our submissions four grams
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
or less uh could involve a district
 
04:58:51.230 --> 04:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
court appearance and this can very much
 
04:58:53.628 --> 04:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
impact uh the laboratory's resources in
 
04:58:56.510 --> 04:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
terms of personnel um and also the
 
04:58:59.030 --> 04:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
district courts tend to want a faster
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
turnaround time and get results because
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
they're scheduling their cases somewhat
 
04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
quickly all of those things impact the
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
laboratory's resources and the final
 
04:59:11.030 --> 04:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
point is that more analyses needing to
 
04:59:13.350 --> 04:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
be performed means the instruments that
 
04:59:14.990 --> 04:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
we have in the laboratory will be more
 
04:59:15.000 --> 04:59:15.708 align:start position:0%
we have in the laboratory will be more
in

04:59:15.708 --> 04:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:59:18.310 --> 04:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
demand uh we may face situations where
 
04:59:20.510 --> 04:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
our analysts are essentially uh waiting
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
in line uh to utilize our
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
instrumentation due to the potential
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
increases in the analyses that we would
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
need to perform so the impact on the
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
laboratory of House Bill
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
511 you know certainly there's a big
 
04:59:35.590 --> 04:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
resource impact both in terms of
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
personnel and Equipment um that would
 
04:59:41.788 --> 04:59:41.798 align:start position:0%
would happen for the labor
 
04:59:45.310 --> 04:59:45.320 align:start position:0%
atory thank you very much you're welcome
 
04:59:47.190 --> 04:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
04:59:54.910 --> 04:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
up thank the witness for Testimony thank
 
04:59:58.990 --> 04:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
you very
 
05:00:10.270 --> 05:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:14.788 --> 05:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:18.430 --> 05:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
there there we go um thank you Mr chair
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
um my name is Richard HED I am the
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
government Affairs coordinator for the
 
05:00:25.150 --> 05:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
judicial branch um here to testify with
 
05:00:26.708 --> 05:00:26.718 align:start position:0%
regard to House Bill
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
526 this follows up on a a letter I sent
 
05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee on the 19th we take no
 
05:00:33.628 --> 05:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
position on the bill we do ask for an
 
05:00:35.470 --> 05:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill however relative
 
05:00:38.110 --> 05:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
to the effective date which is upon
 
05:00:42.470 --> 05:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
passage um as I put in my my February 19
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
letter there's a statute RSA 14 colon
 
05:00:49.548 --> 05:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
9-a which governs the effective date of
 
05:00:52.030 --> 05:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
legislation which says that each law
 
05:00:53.708 --> 05:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
affecting judicial practice and
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
procedure or establishing or eliminating
 
05:00:58.548 --> 05:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
criminal prohibitions civil causes of
 
05:01:01.470 --> 05:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
action or remedies or limitations of uh
 
05:01:03.390 --> 05:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
of action shall take effect on the
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
January one following passage we are
 
05:01:08.830 --> 05:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
asking that the if this bill were to go
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
forward that the effective date be
 
05:01:13.750 --> 05:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
modified and amended from upon passage
 
05:01:15.830 --> 05:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
to January 1
 
05:01:18.430 --> 05:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
2022 because this bill does affect
 
05:01:21.350 --> 05:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
criminal prohibitions and uh judicial
 
05:01:23.708 --> 05:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure the reason for
 
05:01:26.190 --> 05:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
that and and the reason why that statute
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
exists I believe is because hundreds of
 
05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
of um changes are required after each
 
05:01:34.150 --> 05:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
legislative session to the uniform
 
05:01:37.990 --> 05:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
charge table to our Odyssey database all
 
05:01:41.670 --> 05:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
of which tracks um fines tracks how
 
05:01:44.430 --> 05:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
fines are fine monies are distributed
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
who receives them what are the criminal
 
05:01:49.708 --> 05:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
charges the uniform charge table is used
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
by law enforcement throughout the state
 
05:01:54.270 --> 05:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
and there are literally hundreds of
 
05:01:56.430 --> 05:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
changes that are required at the end of
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
a session they all have to be done very
 
05:02:02.430 --> 05:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
precisely um because they they drill
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
down into sections into
 
05:02:08.030 --> 05:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
paragraphs um and are used throughout
 
05:02:11.110 --> 05:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
the state to ensure consistent charging
 
05:02:14.030 --> 05:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
is conducted in in court cases so we we
 
05:02:15.948 --> 05:02:15.958 align:start position:0%
simply take no position on the bill
 
05:02:18.868 --> 05:02:18.878 align:start position:0%
itself but ask that it be amended to be
 
05:02:21.590 --> 05:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
have an effective date of January 1
 
05:02:25.430 --> 05:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
2022 uh consistent with rsa1 14 colon
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
9-a Ian with that I would be happy to

possessions of certain controlled drugs
 
05:03:33.150 --> 05:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
I worked closely with rights and
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
democracy on this bill and they will be
 
05:03:37.628 --> 05:03:37.638 align:start position:0%
testifying today as well um under two A
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
and B in this bill it aims to defelonize
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
the possession of personal use amounts
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
um in this bill 4 ounces or less of
 
05:03:46.548 --> 05:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
scheduled drugs reclassifying to
 
05:03:48.910 --> 05:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor B for the first four
 
05:03:50.990 --> 05:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
convictions for possession after the
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
first four possessions for schedule one
 
05:03:55.390 --> 05:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
through four it would be a class a
 
05:03:57.510 --> 05:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
felony and schedule five would continue
 
05:04:00.750 --> 05:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
to be uh be class B felony um after the
 
05:04:02.270 --> 05:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
first four possessions which doesn't
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
change uh uh two c and d have to do with
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana nothing changes um e nothing
 
05:04:11.230 --> 05:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
changes from current law and F I wanted
 
05:04:14.948 --> 05:04:14.958 align:start position:0%
to explain um the amendment I know that
 
05:04:16.590 --> 05:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee got an
 
05:04:18.628 --> 05:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
amendment I wanted to have that prepared
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
just in case at this time as the prime
 
05:04:23.470 --> 05:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor I I um I would prefer it without
 
05:04:25.788 --> 05:04:25.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment and keep in f um in the
 
05:04:27.590 --> 05:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
end we want to keep it because we're
 
05:04:29.310 --> 05:04:29.320 align:start position:0%
basing this off the language that came
 
05:04:32.750 --> 05:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
out of Colorado rapn was a matter of
 
05:04:34.750 --> 05:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
special concern because it's sometimes
 
05:04:36.990 --> 05:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
used to harm other people not always
 
05:04:39.230 --> 05:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
personal use so for the committee that's
 
05:04:43.310 --> 05:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
why you had um had that Amendment um why
 
05:04:44.948 --> 05:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
I sent it in but I do want to keep that
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
at this point um I know this was touched
 
05:04:49.628 --> 05:04:49.638 align:start position:0%
upon by a testimony um but the main
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
difference between um 615 and 511 is
 
05:04:54.830 --> 05:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does go further um to give
 
05:04:56.590 --> 05:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
people who are suffering ample time to
 
05:04:59.150 --> 05:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
seek help recognizing that this is a
 
05:05:02.430 --> 05:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
public health issue um so this is needed
 
05:05:05.030 --> 05:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
because between 1980 in 2016 the state's
 
05:05:06.910 --> 05:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
prison population increased in size
 
05:05:09.070 --> 05:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
nearly ninefold and admission to the New
 
05:05:11.708 --> 05:05:11.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prison increased by 24%
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
according to the ACLU one in seven
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
people serving time in prison in New
 
05:05:17.470 --> 05:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are in for drug offenses the
 
05:05:19.590 --> 05:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
average cost per inmate in New Hampshire
 
05:05:22.190 --> 05:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
is nearly 35,000 annually putting us in
 
05:05:24.750 --> 05:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
the top third uh in the country for
 
05:05:27.270 --> 05:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
incarceration expenditures um and yet a
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
felony conviction for a drug possession
 
05:05:31.230 --> 05:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
offense has never decreased drug use
 
05:05:33.150 --> 05:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's only created constant barriers to
 
05:05:36.110 --> 05:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
future success and paths to recovery I
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
think we need to shift as a society on
 
05:05:40.750 --> 05:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
how we treat addiction
 
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
stop treating it criminally so
 
05:05:43.750 --> 05:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
individuals can get the help they can
 
05:05:46.430 --> 05:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
get um and this bill is a great start so
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
to conclude I can send in my written
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
testimony if that's helpful um rights
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
and democracy and several experts some
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
who have already spoke some who will um
 
05:05:58.270 --> 05:05:58.280 align:start position:0%
should be testifying um so please feel

Hampshire specifically um it says I am
 
05:09:23.750 --> 05:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
voicing our strong support of HB 511 for
 
05:09:25.670 --> 05:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
many years now the statement we cannot
 
05:09:28.310 --> 05:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
arrest our way out of our drug problem
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
has been used time and time again but
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
progress towards shifting from a
 
05:09:34.270 --> 05:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
punitive approach to drugs to a
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
health-based one is DIY needed HB 511 is
 
05:09:39.868 --> 05:09:39.878 align:start position:0%
a step in the right Direction by
 
05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
lessening the criminal legal
 
05:09:43.590 --> 05:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
consequences people who use drugs face
 
05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
because of their drug use this bill
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
would have important and significant
 
05:09:49.390 --> 05:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
impacts on the cost of incarceration in
 
05:09:51.030 --> 05:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it spends
 
05:09:53.708 --> 05:09:53.718 align:start position:0%
$35,000 annually in incarcerating human
 
05:09:55.910 --> 05:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
beings incarcerating people who use
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
drugs for the drug use does not have any
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
positive impacts on their health or
 
05:10:02.590 --> 05:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
their drug use the result is wasting
 
05:10:05.190 --> 05:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars a significantly higher
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
chance of overdose death once someone is
 
05:10:09.708 --> 05:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
released and a criminal record that
 
05:10:12.110 --> 05:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
creates barriers to housing employment
 
05:10:13.708 --> 05:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
and other opportunities that could
 
05:10:15.948 --> 05:10:15.958 align:start position:0%
actually help people change their lives
 
05:10:17.350 --> 05:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
imagine what a difference it would make
 
05:10:19.150 --> 05:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
if we reinvest that money in
 
05:10:21.470 --> 05:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based interventions such as
 
05:10:23.310 --> 05:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
harm reduction programs overdose
 
05:10:25.628 --> 05:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
production programs and medications for
 
05:10:29.788 --> 05:10:29.798 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder such as bu
 
05:10:32.708 --> 05:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
buprenorphine and methine these are the
 
05:10:34.830 --> 05:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
gold standard treatments for opioid use
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
disorder and cost significantly less per
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
year than incarcerating someone would
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is currently dealing with
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
a crisis of Overdose deaths overdose has
 
05:10:45.150 --> 05:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
been the leading cause of accidental
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
deaths in New Hampshire for many years
 
05:10:49.990 --> 05:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire overdose rate is
 
05:10:54.670 --> 05:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
33.1 per 1,000 in 2018 significantly
 
05:10:57.150 --> 05:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
higher than the national overdose death
 
05:11:00.030 --> 05:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:02.150 --> 05:11:02.160 align:start position:0%

hindrance of therapeutic process um as
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
most of the time is being spent

time and again countless re research has
 
05:12:24.990 --> 05:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
shown that punishment of simple
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
possession charges of drugs uh is just

happening within these uh Correctional

05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing No Hands
 
05:13:03.430 --> 05:13:03.440 align:start position:0%

Accused CH I recognizes Jo Jody

Noel hi um thank thank you for allowing
 
05:13:11.750 --> 05:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
me to be here my name is Jody and uh I
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
will be speaking to the personal impact
 
05:13:16.190 --> 05:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
of the criminalization of drugs um 13
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
years ago my fiance the father of my two
 
05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
boys overdose just 10 feet away from our
 
05:13:21.030 --> 05:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
oldest and I on the other side of a
 
05:13:23.190 --> 05:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
closed door Corey had been through detox
 
05:13:24.708 --> 05:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
and rehab he was doing what he could to
 
05:13:26.590 --> 05:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
stay sober in fact it became his
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
full-time prior priority having lost his
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
job uh our sole income as the result of
 
05:13:33.788 --> 05:13:33.798 align:start position:0%
an arrest for possession of heroin he
 
05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
faced a mandatory minimum prison
 
05:13:36.830 --> 05:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
sentence based on the quantity and we
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
all as a family face the threat of the
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
head of our house old's absence I
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
believe that unfortunately this threat
 
05:13:43.548 --> 05:13:43.558 align:start position:0%
was not only unhelpful in dealing with
 
05:13:45.670 --> 05:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
his addiction it exacerbated his
 
05:13:47.510 --> 05:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
struggle and contributed to his relapse
 
05:13:50.070 --> 05:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
and overdose the research is clear those
 
05:13:51.990 --> 05:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with substance use disorder need
 
05:13:53.868 --> 05:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
Compassionate Care they need support
 
05:13:55.708 --> 05:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
from their Community not isolation from
 
05:13:57.948 --> 05:13:57.958 align:start position:0%
it drug use and addiction aren't enemies
 
05:13:59.708 --> 05:13:59.718 align:start position:0%
to be defeated by force but complex
 
05:14:02.030 --> 05:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
societal and medical problems punitive
 
05:14:03.868 --> 05:14:03.878 align:start position:0%
measures have only worsened the social
 
05:14:06.110 --> 05:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
problems causing addiction and overdose
 
05:14:07.910 --> 05:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
but and their implementation has hurt
 
05:14:09.548 --> 05:14:09.558 align:start position:0%
countless people not not just those
 
05:14:11.030 --> 05:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
whose lives have been lost but those who
 
05:14:13.350 --> 05:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
have been left behind like my sons and I
 
05:14:15.548 --> 05:14:15.558 align:start position:0%
HB 511 would allow us to redirect funds
 
05:14:17.230 --> 05:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
toward proven treatment opportunities so
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
people can recover and stay well the
 
05:14:20.670 --> 05:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
benefits of doing so would be widespread
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
and long- Lasting it would allow people
 
05:14:24.070 --> 05:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
to recover and find work successfully
 
05:14:26.150 --> 05:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
reintegrate into society support
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families remain
 
05:14:29.190 --> 05:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
grounded in their communities and build
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
a build a future my story Corey's story
 
05:14:34.190 --> 05:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
is in the past and there's nothing we
 
05:14:36.470 --> 05:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
can do to change that but I beg you as a
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
mother not to persist in this failed
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
approach because the next generation is
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
at stake thank
 
05:14:45.788 --> 05:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony uh
 
05:14:54.548 --> 05:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.470 --> 05:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
excused the chair now recognizes elen
 
05:15:02.708 --> 05:15:02.718 align:start position:0%
Eagleton hi my name is elen Eagleton and
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of hover New Hampshire
 
05:15:06.310 --> 05:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm a researcher at Dartmouth
 
05:15:09.590 --> 05:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
College and I study neurotrans that are
 
05:15:12.310 --> 05:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
implicated in depression and substance
 
05:15:15.030 --> 05:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
misuse disorder and one in for adults
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
who do have a mental illness also suff
 
05:15:20.510 --> 05:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
suffer from substance misuse Disorder so
 
05:15:23.190 --> 05:15:23.200 align:start position:0%
these um illnesses are commonly
 
05:15:26.708 --> 05:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
co-occurring so it's important to have
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
this bill passed because it helps
 
05:15:32.430 --> 05:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
destigmatize substance misuse um by
 
05:15:34.830 --> 05:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
decreasing the penalty from a felony to
 
05:15:37.270 --> 05:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor um and people who do
 
05:15:38.670 --> 05:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
experience stigma in regards to their
 
05:15:40.510 --> 05:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
drug use are less likely to seek
 
05:15:43.510 --> 05:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
treatment and this results in economic
 
05:15:46.230 --> 05:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
social and medical costs um so I'd like
 
05:15:49.708 --> 05:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
to voice my support in the bill um HB
 
05:15:55.788 --> 05:15:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:58.750 --> 05:15:58.760 align:start position:0%

for over 29 years myself uh I can tell
 
05:16:37.628 --> 05:16:37.638 align:start position:0%
you that having uh this bill pass in
 
05:16:39.990 --> 05:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
this form would be a big step forward uh
 
05:16:41.708 --> 05:16:41.718 align:start position:0%
it' be better if it was a little bit
 
05:16:43.910 --> 05:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
further along but I think that this is a
 
05:16:46.350 --> 05:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
very good start uh we can't keep
 
05:16:48.350 --> 05:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
criminalizing people and for felony
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
offenses for possession amounts uh it's
 
05:16:52.868 --> 05:16:52.878 align:start position:0%
counterproductive there's no evidence
 
05:16:54.510 --> 05:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
that proves that it's actually helpful
 
05:16:56.110 --> 05:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
whatsoever there are many countries
 
05:16:57.110 --> 05:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
around the world that have death
 
05:16:58.948 --> 05:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
penalties for possession and they still
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
have drug use in those countries um you
 
05:17:03.788 --> 05:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
know someone can't get a college loan
 
05:17:05.350 --> 05:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
they can't get housing they can't get a
 
05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
job because of a felony conviction uh we
 
05:17:11.788 --> 05:17:11.798 align:start position:0%
see someone who's in uh in in in trouble
 
05:17:14.190 --> 05:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
because of substance use uh and we'll
 
05:17:15.548 --> 05:17:15.558 align:start position:0%
say why don't they get a job why don't
 
05:17:17.070 --> 05:17:17.080 align:start position:0%
they go back to school why don't they do
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
these things they can't once you have a
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
felony conviction you can't do many of
 
05:17:22.948 --> 05:17:22.958 align:start position:0%
those things so I think this is
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
something that's absolutely necessary
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
the time is long p uh for doing this and
 
05:17:29.788 --> 05:17:29.798 align:start position:0%
I implore you to please pass this
 
05:17:35.070 --> 05:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:37.868 --> 05:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
you representative true thank you Mr
 
05:17:40.190 --> 05:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh representative
 
05:17:43.510 --> 05:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my uh taking my question the
 
05:17:46.430 --> 05:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
bill states that four grams doesn't show
 
05:17:48.548 --> 05:17:48.558 align:start position:0%
an intent to
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
sell could you give me an idea of how
 
05:17:54.430 --> 05:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
much four grams of like fentanyl or LSD
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
would be what what's the mass of that
 
05:18:02.510 --> 05:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
what how much is it four
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
grams I'm not sure I understand the
 
05:18:07.030 --> 05:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
question mass is that is in MA if you're
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
asking how much mass is that it's four
 
05:18:11.628 --> 05:18:11.638 align:start position:0%
so you're asking what does it look like
 
05:18:13.510 --> 05:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
how many doses is it is I'm I'm not
 
05:18:19.150 --> 05:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.390 --> 05:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
understand recognize for a followup yes
 
05:18:24.150 --> 05:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's
 
05:18:27.750 --> 05:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking for the how many
 
05:18:31.670 --> 05:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
doses are in four grams of of
 
05:18:34.510 --> 05:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
fan um good
 
05:18:36.990 --> 05:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
question uh not exactly sure but I can
 
05:18:46.990 --> 05:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:48.190 --> 05:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
I I don't know you want me to look it up
 
05:18:48.200 --> 05:18:52.750 align:start position:0%
I I don't know you want me to look it up
right

05:18:52.750 --> 05:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:55.470 --> 05:18:55.480 align:start position:0%
now follow thank you I'm sorry the
 
05:18:57.868 --> 05:18:57.878 align:start position:0%
witness does not have to look any up to
 
05:19:00.190 --> 05:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
any the only reason I'm asking is
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what I'm dealing
 
05:19:05.510 --> 05:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
with in this bill and so if if four
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
grams says it doesn't does not show
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
intent to sell and four grams of LSD
 
05:19:15.750 --> 05:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
will get uh the whole nation High then
 
05:19:18.510 --> 05:19:18.520 align:start position:0%
then maybe it does in maybe it is an
 
05:19:21.350 --> 05:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
intent to sell and I don't know what
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about when it
 
05:19:26.708 --> 05:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
says how many doses uh that's why I'm
 
05:19:28.868 --> 05:19:28.878 align:start position:0%
asking uh fenel is usually measured in
 
05:19:31.430 --> 05:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
micrograms I can say that um you know
 
05:19:33.628 --> 05:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
maybe if you want to if if this was such
 
05:19:36.590 --> 05:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
a big concern uh you know you can
 
05:19:38.270 --> 05:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
actually have someone look into what
 
05:19:38.280 --> 05:19:39.788 align:start position:0%
actually have someone look into what
specific

05:19:39.788 --> 05:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
doses are are gotten from a certain gram
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
amount but
 
05:19:47.910 --> 05:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
um you know fentanyl is usually in in
 
05:19:52.350 --> 05:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
milligrams or micrograms sorry thank you
 
05:19:54.430 --> 05:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
a lot smaller amount four four grams if
 
05:19:56.910 --> 05:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
you want to just real real General it is
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
is it is a pretty good amount of
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.320 --> 05:20:04.750 align:start position:0%
 
least

05:20:04.750 --> 05:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
least
 
05:20:08.830 --> 05:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
100% so just put that in perspective
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
sorry inter this it's okay what what was
 
05:20:17.948 --> 05:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:23.270 --> 05:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
T never mind let me just show you
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
something I'll

follower great thank you Mr chair and
 
05:20:55.150 --> 05:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
thank you committee for hearing me today
 
05:20:57.390 --> 05:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Ryan Fowler and I'm a person
 
05:20:59.910 --> 05:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
in long-term recovery I'm also a
 
05:21:02.750 --> 05:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
Certified Recovery support worker and uh
 
05:21:05.070 --> 05:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
before I get my minute did you all
 
05:21:06.910 --> 05:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
receive the letter I sent this morning
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
that kind of has most of my thoughts in
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
it there was a letter I sent this
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
morning with most of these thoughts um
 
05:21:14.788 --> 05:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
if you did not get it I'd love to get
 
05:21:17.310 --> 05:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
that to you I'm here as a member of the
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
public um person in recovery I have
 
05:21:22.868 --> 05:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
worked for various versions of the safe
 
05:21:25.548 --> 05:21:25.558 align:start position:0%
stations I help to roll out the doorways
 
05:21:26.830 --> 05:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
I've worked for the addiction Crisis
 
05:21:29.670 --> 05:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
Line wraps I trained substance use
 
05:21:32.750 --> 05:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
professionals and I was kind of one of
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
the people who were saying that this
 
05:21:35.708 --> 05:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
bill would be a really good idea it
 
05:21:37.788 --> 05:21:37.798 align:start position:0%
would simplify the scheduling apparatus
 
05:21:39.390 --> 05:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
for a simple position profession and
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
make law enforcement's job easier like
 
05:21:43.788 --> 05:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
we've seen in other states the idea is
 
05:21:45.510 --> 05:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
that the scheduling apparatus that you
 
05:21:47.510 --> 05:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
all keep going back and forth with is
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
always subjective it's not founded in
 
05:21:53.230 --> 05:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
science it's oftentimes founded in
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
targeting certain populations the
 
05:21:56.590 --> 05:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
current scheduling operatus at the
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
federal level makes no sense and it
 
05:22:01.868 --> 05:22:01.878 align:start position:0%
oftentimes translates to the subjective
 
05:22:04.510 --> 05:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
dispensing of punishment and I'm
 
05:22:06.788 --> 05:22:06.798 align:start position:0%
somebody who benefited from that I'm a
 
05:22:08.190 --> 05:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
straight white middle class male from
 
05:22:09.990 --> 05:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
new h sure I've been arrested with
 
05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
felony drugs five or six times and I'm
 
05:22:14.788 --> 05:22:14.798 align:start position:0%
not a felon and because I'm not a felon
 
05:22:17.788 --> 05:22:17.798 align:start position:0%
I was able to excel in recovery uh in
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
the past six years I've developed
 
05:22:21.350 --> 05:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
professionally and I've engaged in
 
05:22:23.310 --> 05:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
research uh both personally and with
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um I've done a lot of really
 
05:22:27.110 --> 05:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
cool things using my negative experience
 
05:22:29.670 --> 05:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
for good and I see all too often people
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
whose felony conviction follows them
 
05:22:33.990 --> 05:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
forever keeping them from housing
 
05:22:37.628 --> 05:22:37.638 align:start position:0%
employment um education and it's really
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh contrary to what we know about
 
05:22:40.548 --> 05:22:40.558 align:start position:0%
substance use disorders because we
 
05:22:42.510 --> 05:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
Define these disorders as continuing to
 
05:22:45.310 --> 05:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
use despite negative consequences so the
 
05:22:47.030 --> 05:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
first offense for a small amount of
 
05:22:48.910 --> 05:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
drugs should not be a lifetime of a
 
05:22:50.708 --> 05:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
scarlet letter F that follows them
 
05:22:54.628 --> 05:22:54.638 align:start position:0%
forever when is time served um I could
 
05:22:56.948 --> 05:22:56.958 align:start position:0%
answer questions you had about uh the
 
05:22:59.470 --> 05:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
personal use amounts uh my 10 years of
 
05:23:01.868 --> 05:23:01.878 align:start position:0%
chaotic drug use included selling I was
 
05:23:04.270 --> 05:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
in distribution um and because of my
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
research I've had some interesting views
 
05:23:09.470 --> 05:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
of um like what's going on now now with
 
05:23:12.830 --> 05:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
the um current situation and uh moral of
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
the story is prohibition does not work
 
05:23:16.868 --> 05:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
punishing people is not the answer to
 
05:23:18.430 --> 05:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
this and we're really talking about
 
05:23:19.948 --> 05:23:19.958 align:start position:0%
punishing people and who goes to jail
 
05:23:21.868 --> 05:23:21.878 align:start position:0%
and who does not really it's about
 
05:23:23.948 --> 05:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
compassion and human dignity and
 
05:23:25.510 --> 05:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
treating this like a health issue not a
 
05:23:27.830 --> 05:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
criminal issue this would support law
 
05:23:30.670 --> 05:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement and it's really time to
 
05:23:32.590 --> 05:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
change what we've been doing we have 100
 
05:23:34.350 --> 05:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
years of Prohibition we know prohibition
 
05:23:37.948 --> 05:23:37.958 align:start position:0%
does not work and if you uh I've sent in
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
a letter you can read the rest I think
 
05:23:42.150 --> 05:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
my minute's up happy to answer questions

Bill 511 reduce criminal penalties for

under four grams from a felony to a
 
05:24:30.030 --> 05:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor defense I have been a New
 
05:24:31.670 --> 05:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident for most of my life I
 
05:24:33.150 --> 05:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
am writing this to you as a proud woman
 
05:24:35.510 --> 05:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
in recovery from long-term intravenous
 
05:24:38.430 --> 05:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
drug use however I cannot think my home
 
05:24:40.150 --> 05:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
state for any of the outstanding changes
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
I have made in my life to be honest New
 
05:24:44.510 --> 05:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has failed me and it continues
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
to fail sick and suffering let me ask
 
05:24:48.750 --> 05:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
you would you incarcerate someone with
 
05:24:50.430 --> 05:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
skizo effective disorder for having
 
05:24:50.440 --> 05:24:51.430 align:start position:0%
skizo effective disorder for having
auditory

05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
auditory
 
05:24:53.470 --> 05:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
hallucinations why do we demonize human
 
05:24:54.990 --> 05:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
beings suffering from substance use
 
05:24:56.830 --> 05:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
disorder I personally have been
 
05:24:58.270 --> 05:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerated for reasons due to my
 
05:25:00.990 --> 05:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
plight with substance use disorder it
 
05:25:02.750 --> 05:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
has only made it harder for me to find
 
05:25:05.990 --> 05:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
recovery our prison systems are flawed I
 
05:25:08.310 --> 05:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
receive no help for my substance use
 
05:25:10.708 --> 05:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
disorder while I was within jail I was
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
only beat down and made the feel
 
05:25:14.708 --> 05:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
Unworthy of a happy life I signed up for
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
every AA meeting and none of them ever
 
05:25:20.190 --> 05:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
showed I searched the bookshelf for
 
05:25:21.708 --> 05:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
anything that could help me and all I
 
05:25:24.868 --> 05:25:24.878 align:start position:0%
found was one torn up AA book I listen
 
05:25:26.548 --> 05:25:26.558 align:start position:0%
the woman cry himself to sleep every
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
night because they just couldn't
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
understand why they couldn't stop using
 
05:25:32.910 --> 05:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
they swore that they would never pick up
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
again and then they were released out
 
05:25:37.150 --> 05:25:37.160 align:start position:0%
onto the street with no resources to
 
05:25:38.990 --> 05:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to help themselves there is
 
05:25:41.150 --> 05:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
nobody there telling them that they're
 
05:25:43.430 --> 05:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
worthy or capable I am one of those
 
05:25:46.750 --> 05:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
women we cannot stop using
 
05:25:49.470 --> 05:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
because disorder is a health use issue
 
05:25:51.030 --> 05:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
and not a criminal issue the very
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
definition of insanity is doing the same
 
05:25:54.708 --> 05:25:54.718 align:start position:0%
thing over and over again expecting a
 
05:25:56.430 --> 05:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
different result why do we allow this
 
05:25:58.590 --> 05:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
Insanity to continue why is change so
 
05:26:00.430 --> 05:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
scary when it's proven to save
 
05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
lives institutionalize women for being
 
05:26:04.750 --> 05:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
outspoken and opinionated you cannot
 
05:26:06.590 --> 05:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
tell me that there is no room for growth
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
within our system there are always be a
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
need for growth and understanding
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
because our society is ever evolving are
 
05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
you going to let the ones are you going
 
05:26:17.350 --> 05:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
to be the ones to make a change are you
 
05:26:18.750 --> 05:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
willing to help an entire younger
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
generation get their parents back or you
 
05:26:21.708 --> 05:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
continue to show them that their
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
parents' lives are not important because
 
05:26:25.110 --> 05:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
they're inflicted with an invisible
 
05:26:27.470 --> 05:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
disease let us be the change thank you
 
05:26:30.390 --> 05:26:30.400 align:start position:0%

Nikki 40 I am a licensed clinical social
 
05:27:40.628 --> 05:27:40.638 align:start position:0%
worker and Master's licensed uh alcohol
 
05:27:43.270 --> 05:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
and drug counselor in New Hampshire um I
 
05:27:46.628 --> 05:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
work mostly in Manchester I'm testifying
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
in support of HB 511 today um I helped
 
05:27:54.070 --> 05:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
put some of it together and did a lot of
 
05:27:57.230 --> 05:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
the research behind it um I wanted to
 
05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
answer some of the questions that came
 
05:28:01.628 --> 05:28:01.638 align:start position:0%
up uh in terms of you know why four
 
05:28:03.590 --> 05:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
grams how much is four grams what are we
 
05:28:06.350 --> 05:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
talking about um it depends you know
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
obviously on the substance but it also
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
depends on what the tolerance of the
 
05:28:14.110 --> 05:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
person is I currently work with people
 
05:28:16.190 --> 05:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
being released from federal
 
05:28:18.628 --> 05:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
incarceration um I have seen what a
 
05:28:21.470 --> 05:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
felony conviction does to someone and
 
05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
re-entry is very very difficult in this
 
05:28:25.868 --> 05:28:25.878 align:start position:0%
state there are very few resources
 
05:28:30.310 --> 05:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
available my hands are often tied um but
 
05:28:32.830 --> 05:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
in working with people who use drugs who
 
05:28:35.470 --> 05:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
have used drugs for many years um in
 
05:28:37.628 --> 05:28:37.638 align:start position:0%
fentanyl when they tell me about what
 
05:28:39.230 --> 05:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
was at the height of their use how much
 
05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
were they
 
05:28:42.708 --> 05:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
using I have multiple people who are
 
05:28:46.190 --> 05:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
using up to 10 grams a day so it really
 
05:28:48.350 --> 05:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
has to do with someone's tolerance and
 
05:28:50.350 --> 05:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
what an amount is going to do to one
 
05:28:51.830 --> 05:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
person is not the same that it's going
 
05:28:54.670 --> 05:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
to do to another person so we we chose
 
05:28:57.470 --> 05:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
four grams because we wanted to specify
 
05:29:00.628 --> 05:29:00.638 align:start position:0%
an amount it is not perfect there's
 
05:29:02.430 --> 05:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
never going to be a perfect designation
 
05:29:05.190 --> 05:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
a perfect line but we wanted to create a
 
05:29:07.708 --> 05:29:07.718 align:start position:0%
line because as it is now where there is
 
05:29:10.030 --> 05:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
no amount specified you could have the
 
05:29:11.868 --> 05:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
smallest amount of a controlled
 
05:29:13.548 --> 05:29:13.558 align:start position:0%
substance and you're automatically a
 
05:29:17.548 --> 05:29:17.558 align:start position:0%
felon in this state that is wrong um and
 
05:29:19.628 --> 05:29:19.638 align:start position:0%
I I strongly believe in this bill that
 
05:29:21.910 --> 05:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
it will be able to help many people
 
05:29:25.510 --> 05:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
reintegrate into society much easier and
 
05:29:27.390 --> 05:29:27.400 align:start position:0%
as far as treatment in while
 
05:29:29.110 --> 05:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated versus treatment in the
 
05:29:31.110 --> 05:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
community treatment in the community
 
05:29:33.470 --> 05:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
Works treatment while incarcerated is
 
05:29:35.628 --> 05:29:35.638 align:start position:0%
very difficult especially in times of
 
05:29:37.788 --> 05:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
the Corona virus there's almost nothing
 
05:29:37.798 --> 05:29:40.510 align:start position:0%
the Corona virus there's almost nothing
going

05:29:40.510 --> 05:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:43.868 --> 05:29:43.878 align:start position:0%
on thank you for your testimony we do uh
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
we do have time to limit
 
05:29:49.470 --> 05:29:49.480 align:start position:0%
testimony however you are permitted to
 
05:29:50.948 --> 05:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
answer questions by members
 
05:29:50.958 --> 05:29:53.470 align:start position:0%
answer questions by members
representative

05:29:53.470 --> 05:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:29:55.788 --> 05:29:55.798 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:29:59.310 --> 05:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question to the witness um
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
I I realize that there's a difference in
 
05:30:04.590 --> 05:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
in um substance abuse problems with
 
05:30:08.030 --> 05:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
alcohol and with drugs and I know they
 
05:30:09.990 --> 05:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
both difficult but the one with drugs is
 
05:30:12.390 --> 05:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
probably much more difficult uh could
 
05:30:15.230 --> 05:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
you make some comments on the the number
 
05:30:18.390 --> 05:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
of four prior offenses is that not
 
05:30:20.350 --> 05:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
enough too many and and what your
 
05:30:24.190 --> 05:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
opinion is of that uh concerning uh a
 
05:30:26.390 --> 05:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
successful recovery for
 
05:30:28.868 --> 05:30:28.878 align:start position:0%
someone sure um I I don't know if I
 
05:30:30.470 --> 05:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
would agree with your statement about
 
05:30:32.390 --> 05:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
the difference with alcohol and and
 
05:30:35.628 --> 05:30:35.638 align:start position:0%
substances and drugs um I think we often
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
make a distinction between the two
 
05:30:38.830 --> 05:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
because alcohol has been legal for most
 
05:30:40.948 --> 05:30:40.958 align:start position:0%
of our Lives um I have seen people's
 
05:30:42.708 --> 05:30:42.718 align:start position:0%
lives completely destroyed by alcohol
 
05:30:45.310 --> 05:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
and alcohol Alone um in terms of the
 
05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
four offenses um as I think Ryan Fowler
 
05:30:51.350 --> 05:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned we did model this on some
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
legislation that had come out of
 
05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
Colorado again recognizing we wanted it
 
05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
to not be unlimited um but the the
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
definition of substance use disorder is
 
05:31:04.750 --> 05:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
continuing to use despite negative
 
05:31:07.590 --> 05:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
consequences and we didn't feel that a
 
05:31:09.868 --> 05:31:09.878 align:start position:0%
first time just a one-time deal a
 
05:31:12.670 --> 05:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
one-time shot made sense that there can
 
05:31:15.470 --> 05:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
be multiple situations particularly if
 
05:31:19.470 --> 05:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
people are in the same um social groups
 
05:31:23.230 --> 05:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
or in the same parts of New Hampshire
 
05:31:24.948 --> 05:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
the way that policing works you know
 
05:31:26.190 --> 05:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
there are certain parts of certain
 
05:31:29.110 --> 05:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
cities that get uh you know people get
 
05:31:32.390 --> 05:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
picked up more often so we we wanted to
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
create a line um in terms of it not
 
05:31:37.310 --> 05:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
being unlimited and we felt that we
 
05:31:40.030 --> 05:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
needed to at least at least a few
 
05:31:41.628 --> 05:31:41.638 align:start position:0%
chances where someone would have a
 
05:31:43.910 --> 05:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and and you know maybe the
 
05:31:46.070 --> 05:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
first one is not enough of of the wakeup
 
05:31:48.750 --> 05:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
call um maybe it's not enough to get
 
05:31:50.910 --> 05:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
them to think about having something
 
05:31:54.708 --> 05:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
different for their life um but to have
 
05:31:56.548 --> 05:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
a couple chances and interactions with
 
05:31:58.510 --> 05:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
the law and what what that can make that
 
05:32:02.070 --> 05:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
possible you know the the idea is to
 
05:32:02.080 --> 05:32:03.470 align:start position:0%
possible you know the the idea is to
rehabilitate

05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
people and increase their life
 
05:32:08.470 --> 05:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
functioning and branding them felon does
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
not help
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your answer
 
05:32:15.628 --> 05:32:15.638 align:start position:0%
representative hoer you thank you for
 
05:32:17.030 --> 05:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:32:20.110 --> 05:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
question I con seeed the uh point about
 
05:32:22.150 --> 05:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
not making anybody a
 
05:32:29.590 --> 05:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
felon but um would you believe that a um
 
05:32:33.150 --> 05:32:33.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who shoots fanol into their arm
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
is has completely lost control of their
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%
ability to decide and maybe they should
 
05:32:41.708 --> 05:32:41.718 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated for at least 6 months to
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
give them a possible chance of breaking
 
05:32:49.788 --> 05:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:52.430 --> 05:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
in um I would I would not say
 
05:32:55.150 --> 05:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily if someone is using um
 
05:32:56.990 --> 05:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
fentanyl intravenously that they have
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
lost all control that is very it's very
 
05:33:02.548 --> 05:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
different um I
 
05:33:05.350 --> 05:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
have through different things I'm
 
05:33:09.788 --> 05:33:09.798 align:start position:0%
involved with with um and I did work for
 
05:33:13.510 --> 05:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
two years at a methadone clinic um in in
 
05:33:16.270 --> 05:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire um so I
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
I have interacted with many people who
 
05:33:19.830 --> 05:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
have used drugs recently or currently
 
05:33:22.990 --> 05:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
use drugs um there are some people that
 
05:33:25.030 --> 05:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
you would never know if they didn't show
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
you their arms you would never know um I
 
05:33:30.510 --> 05:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
think our our conception of what what an
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
intervenous drug user looks like or
 
05:33:35.310 --> 05:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
sounds like can be can be very deceptive
 
05:33:37.110 --> 05:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of stereotypes out
 
05:33:40.510 --> 05:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
there um in terms of you know would a
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
few months six months in jail help
 
05:33:45.470 --> 05:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
someone find recovery or turn their life
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
around there are definitely you know
 
05:33:50.750 --> 05:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
cases that I I've been doing this type
 
05:33:52.910 --> 05:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
of work for about eight years so I have
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
counseled thousands of people at this
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
point Are there specific couple
 
05:33:58.708 --> 05:33:58.718 align:start position:0%
anecdotal cases I could I could tell you
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
about where where a jail sentence did
 
05:34:05.230 --> 05:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
help sure but it's not um I don't think
 
05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
it is helpful for everybody I have heard
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
far more cases of people um experiencing
 
05:34:14.430 --> 05:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
terrible withdrawal that has not been
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
medicated in jail um also we need to
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
remember that jails and prisons are not
 
05:34:24.190 --> 05:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
drug-free spaces um the majority of
 
05:34:26.230 --> 05:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
people that I am I am counseling now in
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
my position um people getting out of
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
incarceration um many of them use drugs
 
05:34:34.830 --> 05:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
in jail um many I have had people start
 
05:34:38.910 --> 05:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
drugs in jail in prison um in to cope
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
with the reality of of being
 
05:34:45.190 --> 05:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so I I don't think it well
 
05:34:47.310 --> 05:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
I I wish it were that simple I wish that
 
05:34:49.270 --> 05:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
we could lock someone up and you know
 
05:34:51.548 --> 05:34:51.558 align:start position:0%
and okay fine that would work but in
 
05:34:53.350 --> 05:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
reality that's that's not how it plays
 
05:34:55.350 --> 05:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
out and if anything the trauma that
 
05:34:58.190 --> 05:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
people experience while incarcerated can
 
05:35:00.670 --> 05:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
can comp complicate their drug use and
 
05:35:04.350 --> 05:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%

um I don't see um any reasons that that
 
05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
an addict should be arrested and
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated um due to their addiction I
 
05:36:31.948 --> 05:36:31.958 align:start position:0%
don't think that incarceration ever
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
helps in an addict on the road to
 
05:36:37.270 --> 05:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
recovery you know I just thinks it takes
 
05:36:40.390 --> 05:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
away the options that they have on that
 
05:36:45.030 --> 05:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
road you know um and I want to testify
 
05:36:50.230 --> 05:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
to the four grams you know an addict
 
05:36:52.270 --> 05:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
it's more susceptible to be walking
 
05:36:54.350 --> 05:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
around with four grams from the time
 
05:36:57.190 --> 05:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
wherever they got the drugs from on
 
05:36:59.190 --> 05:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
going to where they're going to use this
 
05:37:02.350 --> 05:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
drug and in that time you know they have
 
05:37:06.150 --> 05:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
to escape the law you know and um I
 
05:37:10.030 --> 05:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
don't think it it it's right to
 
05:37:13.788 --> 05:37:13.798 align:start position:0%
continuously incarcerate our our addicts
 
05:37:16.750 --> 05:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
who actually just need help and on that
 
05:37:18.030 --> 05:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
road to
 
05:37:20.948 --> 05:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
recovery um the ones that are dealing
 
05:37:22.868 --> 05:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
the drugs aren't the ones that's walking
 
05:37:25.548 --> 05:37:25.558 align:start position:0%
around the streets with up to four GS
 
05:37:29.390 --> 05:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
you know um those are the ones that that
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
um are the ones that that need to be
 
05:37:35.548 --> 05:37:35.558 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and not the ones that's um
 
05:37:40.070 --> 05:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's actually suffering from from this
 
05:37:42.590 --> 05:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
addiction Mr Harris we do have to limit

05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
Chiefs uh in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:39:03.230 --> 05:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
are opposed to both 511 and HB 526 I'll
 
05:39:06.868 --> 05:39:06.878 align:start position:0%
be speaking primarily to uh HB 511 today
 
05:39:08.590 --> 05:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
I have more than 42 years of continuous
 
05:39:10.990 --> 05:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement experience 27 of those
 
05:39:12.590 --> 05:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
are spent dealing directly with
 
05:39:14.868 --> 05:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
substance abuse by passing this bill the
 
05:39:16.510 --> 05:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
Chiefs believe that making possession of
 
05:39:19.788 --> 05:39:19.798 align:start position:0%
four grams or less of a um or less a
 
05:39:21.910 --> 05:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor you're effectively
 
05:39:23.590 --> 05:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
making the possession of enough of a
 
05:39:25.510 --> 05:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
certain controlled drug sufficient to
 
05:39:27.868 --> 05:39:27.878 align:start position:0%
kill 100 or more people a Class B
 
05:39:30.510 --> 05:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor each Street bag contains
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
enough fentanyl to kill a person the
 
05:39:34.030 --> 05:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
consequence of this bill when we are
 
05:39:35.708 --> 05:39:35.718 align:start position:0%
still within the grip of an Insidious
 
05:39:37.750 --> 05:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
killer fentanyl which is killed more
 
05:39:39.868 --> 05:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
than 3,000 people in our state with
 
05:39:41.548 --> 05:39:41.558 align:start position:0%
another killer falling close behind
 
05:39:43.468 --> 05:39:43.478 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine is potentially
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
devastating we as a society must be
 
05:39:47.708 --> 05:39:47.718 align:start position:0%
clear to all those who seek to abuse and
 
05:39:50.430 --> 05:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
sell drugs that kill that Society does
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
not contone this Behavior there must be
 
05:39:55.230 --> 05:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
consequences to possessing killer drugs
 
05:39:56.590 --> 05:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
you've probably read the tragic story
 
05:39:58.150 --> 05:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
out of one da where an infant died
 
05:39:59.708 --> 05:39:59.718 align:start position:0%
because the parents and another person
 
05:40:01.788 --> 05:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
allegedly were in possession of killer
 
05:40:03.788 --> 05:40:03.798 align:start position:0%
drugs that resulted in the infant's
 
05:40:06.190 --> 05:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
tragic deaths in my 40 years I spoken to
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of drug users and drug Sellers
 
05:40:10.548 --> 05:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
and most of those who survived to that I
 
05:40:12.868 --> 05:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
spoke with told me that being arrested
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
gave them another chance at a change an
 
05:40:17.310 --> 05:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh To Be Drug Free long
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
enough to reconsider parents have begged
 
05:40:21.110 --> 05:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
us to have their children arrested so
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be in jail away from drugs that
 
05:40:26.310 --> 05:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
can kill them reducing penalties used
 
05:40:27.990 --> 05:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
against traffickers is just not the
 
05:40:30.070 --> 05:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
common sense approach to dealing with
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
criminals whose only purposes to make
 
05:40:34.150 --> 05:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
money by selling poison that destroys
 
05:40:36.830 --> 05:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
lives families and harms our economy in
 
05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
the future
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
if you really want to make a change kill
 
05:40:42.670 --> 05:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and reinvest in evidence-based
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
uh drug treatment programs for those in
 
05:40:46.990 --> 05:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
jail that really work that really work
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
give them a chance and don't take their
 
05:40:50.750 --> 05:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
few chances of survival away thank you
 
05:40:54.830 --> 05:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:56.670 --> 05:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
Testimony I want to thank you for your
 
05:40:58.350 --> 05:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
testimony if if you don't mind that the
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
chair would just like to inquire of uh
 
05:41:04.190 --> 05:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
two questions uh just for for the
 
05:41:06.510 --> 05:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the committee there's a
 
05:41:07.830 --> 05:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
different schedule
 
05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
of uh of control drugs can you just
 
05:41:13.430 --> 05:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
describe just a few drugs that would be
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
fall in the schedule 1 2 3 or four sure
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh schedule one are those uh control
 
05:41:22.110 --> 05:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
substances that have no medical value or
 
05:41:25.750 --> 05:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
use and are highly addictive so uh those
 
05:41:28.670 --> 05:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
are drugs such as heroin um and other
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
types of drugs that have no medical
 
05:41:33.548 --> 05:41:33.558 align:start position:0%
usefulness and are declared by DEA uh to
 
05:41:35.590 --> 05:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
be highly addictive and dangerous and
 
05:41:37.628 --> 05:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
should be placed in schedule one
 
05:41:39.590 --> 05:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
scheduled Two drugs like fentanyl of
 
05:41:42.468 --> 05:41:42.478 align:start position:0%
course there is a um pharmaceutical and
 
05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
medicinal use for fentanyl um that um
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists use so as an example
 
05:41:51.230 --> 05:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is placed in schedule two along
 
05:41:53.708 --> 05:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
with cocaine and derivatives like
 
05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
lidocaine um things that dentists use
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
when you go to the dentist um those are
 
05:42:00.708 --> 05:42:00.718 align:start position:0%
placed in schedule two but schedule Two
 
05:42:03.390 --> 05:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
drugs are also deemed to have um a
 
05:42:07.190 --> 05:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
greater risk of of addiction and and
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
version and misuse schedule three drugs
 
05:42:12.468 --> 05:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
are those drugs that have medicinal
 
05:42:14.670 --> 05:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
value and that have a lower risk and
 
05:42:17.590 --> 05:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
potential for uh addiction and scheduled
 
05:42:19.868 --> 05:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
for drugs are generally those medicinal
 
05:42:22.990 --> 05:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
drugs that have no risk for uh addiction
 
05:42:25.230 --> 05:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
or misuse I hope hopefully that clears
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:30.150 --> 05:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
05:42:32.468 --> 05:42:32.478 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:42:35.670 --> 05:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
Muse yes thank you for taking thank you
 
05:42:37.990 --> 05:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm I'm just
 
05:42:42.430 --> 05:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
curious whether HB 511 would in any way
 
05:42:45.628 --> 05:42:45.638 align:start position:0%
affect your ability to arrest people who
 
05:42:48.430 --> 05:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
are selling drugs versus simply
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
possessing them so does it does it does
 
05:42:53.548 --> 05:42:53.558 align:start position:0%
it do anything that makes it harder for
 
05:42:57.350 --> 05:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
you uh to enforce the law against people
 
05:42:59.310 --> 05:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
who are actually selling
 
05:43:01.750 --> 05:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
drugs well yes and thank you for your
 
05:43:05.070 --> 05:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
question uh absolutely uh representative
 
05:43:09.948 --> 05:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
um um for grams of of heroin fentanyl um
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
are equivalent to 100 Street bags and uh
 
05:43:15.390 --> 05:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
often times we encounter dealers that
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
are selling four five 10 15 20 bags um I
 
05:43:21.230 --> 05:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
can tell you that when various laws
 
05:43:23.430 --> 05:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
change regarding the possession of
 
05:43:26.230 --> 05:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
quantities that reduces the penalty for
 
05:43:28.990 --> 05:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
a threshold quantity what uh traffickers
 
05:43:31.230 --> 05:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
typically do is reduce uh just below
 
05:43:33.430 --> 05:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
that that threshold so that if they are
 
05:43:36.310 --> 05:43:36.320 align:start position:0%
caught then um they simply will face the
 
05:43:38.070 --> 05:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
the Lesser penalty in this case a Class
 
05:43:41.708 --> 05:43:41.718 align:start position:0%
B misdemeanor for which in our state
 
05:43:43.548 --> 05:43:43.558 align:start position:0%
virtually no one goes to jail and pays a
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
small monetary fine so four grams is a
 
05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
is an enormous amount when we're talking
 
05:43:51.468 --> 05:43:51.478 align:start position:0%
about heroin fentanyl methamphetamine um
 
05:43:54.910 --> 05:43:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:54.920 --> 05:43:59.350 align:start position:0%
 
people

05:43:59.350 --> 05:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:01.390 --> 05:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
thank representative
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
CH thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:44:08.868 --> 05:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:11.070 --> 05:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
um I think you're trying you're helping
 
05:44:14.350 --> 05:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
me get a a handle on what what the doses
 
05:44:17.708 --> 05:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
are so so four grams of heroin uh I
 
05:44:20.030 --> 05:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
believe you said would be 100 Street
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
bags I'm assuming that a street bag is
 
05:44:25.948 --> 05:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
one dose so how many doses would a
 
05:44:29.430 --> 05:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
normal person use in a day well again I
 
05:44:31.230 --> 05:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
think that you heard previous testimony
 
05:44:33.788 --> 05:44:33.798 align:start position:0%
that people develop a tolerance a
 
05:44:36.430 --> 05:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
physiological tolerance to certain drugs
 
05:44:39.070 --> 05:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
so that it requires over time uh greater
 
05:44:42.390 --> 05:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
use right so a bag of heroin um
 
05:44:45.190 --> 05:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
typically runs around quarter gram ten
 
05:44:48.270 --> 05:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
gram and it all depends on the strength
 
05:44:51.468 --> 05:44:51.478 align:start position:0%
of that drug that um determines whether
 
05:44:53.830 --> 05:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
or not that person uses an entire bag a
 
05:44:57.150 --> 05:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
day um but oftentimes over time an
 
05:44:59.070 --> 05:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
individual who is using a drug that they
 
05:45:01.190 --> 05:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
develop a physiological tolerance to
 
05:45:03.708 --> 05:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
such as heroin will increase has to
 
05:45:05.708 --> 05:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
increase uh the amount of drugs that
 
05:45:07.948 --> 05:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
they use so they may incre to several
 
05:45:11.110 --> 05:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
bags a day uh to be able to avoid being
 
05:45:13.868 --> 05:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
what we call drug sick um or going into
 
05:45:17.750 --> 05:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
some withdrawal uh syndrome so um 100
 
05:45:20.468 --> 05:45:20.478 align:start position:0%
bags uh is is an enormous amount uh
 
05:45:23.270 --> 05:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
Street sellers uh in Manchester Nashua
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
and other places of the country
 
05:45:29.110 --> 05:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
typically sell 10 20 30 40 bags um a
 
05:45:32.030 --> 05:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
less 100 bag dealer is a significant
 
05:45:39.110 --> 05:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Colley thank you Mr
 
05:45:44.548 --> 05:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you sir for taking
 
05:45:47.750 --> 05:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
the question am I right this discussion
 
05:45:49.190 --> 05:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
around trafficking I think that's sort
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
of separate from the attend of the bill
 
05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
but um am I right that current
 
05:45:54.080 --> 05:45:56.110 align:start position:0%
but um am I right that current
statute

05:45:56.110 --> 05:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:45:58.990 --> 05:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
um offers a lot of discretion to
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
prosecutors around
 
05:46:03.788 --> 05:46:03.798 align:start position:0%
weighing um circumstances of a case to
 
05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
determine what to charge someone with so
 
05:46:08.468 --> 05:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
the it sounds like this bill is more
 
05:46:10.948 --> 05:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
about possession and we've
 
05:46:13.670 --> 05:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
gotten off on a discussion of
 
05:46:17.548 --> 05:46:17.558 align:start position:0%
trafficking so am I right in that um
 
05:46:19.390 --> 05:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
there are ways to discern between
 
05:46:23.070 --> 05:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
trafficking and possession for personal
 
05:46:25.628 --> 05:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
use well yes there is and and you're
 
05:46:28.270 --> 05:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
right that prosecutors and the Judiciary
 
05:46:30.628 --> 05:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
take into account um that information
 
05:46:32.990 --> 05:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
and and I think this bill is attempting
 
05:46:36.030 --> 05:46:36.040 align:start position:0%
to fix a problem by creating a problem
 
05:46:39.628 --> 05:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
and um that goes directly to U what what
 
05:46:40.868 --> 05:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
your question is and thanks for your
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
question I think that what this bill
 
05:46:45.910 --> 05:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
would do is effectively uh eliminate an
 
05:46:48.910 --> 05:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for law enforcement to deal
 
05:46:51.548 --> 05:46:51.558 align:start position:0%
with drug traffickers uh drug users as
 
05:46:53.110 --> 05:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
you rightly know in many cases
 
05:46:54.750 --> 05:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and many counties
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
go to drug court um because they are
 
05:47:00.390 --> 05:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
typically in possession of uh personally
 
05:47:02.270 --> 05:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
use quantities of drugs and so they are
 
05:47:05.548 --> 05:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
diverted into Drug Fort system um the
 
05:47:08.070 --> 05:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
people that I talk with um over the
 
05:47:10.788 --> 05:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
course of my 40 Years of police work
 
05:47:13.230 --> 05:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
tell me time and time and time again yes
 
05:47:15.070 --> 05:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
yes there are there drugs in jail sure
 
05:47:17.150 --> 05:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
there's drugs in jail but oftentimes
 
05:47:18.628 --> 05:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
when they're in jail it gives them time
 
05:47:21.110 --> 05:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
to reflect a time to think about um and
 
05:47:24.150 --> 05:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
gives them another chance to um consider
 
05:47:26.468 --> 05:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
where their life's trajectory is going
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
what where we fail is making sure that
 
05:47:31.390 --> 05:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
we provide those folks who do end up in
 
05:47:33.230 --> 05:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
jail because oftentimes drug users don't
 
05:47:35.430 --> 05:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
end up in jail they end up in jail after
 
05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
failing drug court two or three times
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
and then they end up in jail let's make
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
sure that when they do go to jail and
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
they're a substance abuser no matter
 
05:47:44.510 --> 05:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
what the substance is that they're given
 
05:47:46.230 --> 05:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
an evidence-based treatment program
 
05:47:47.788 --> 05:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
that's where we need to
 
05:47:52.430 --> 05:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:55.110 --> 05:47:55.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:47:57.230 --> 05:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:47:59.390 --> 05:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
to the W witness for taking my question
 
05:48:01.230 --> 05:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
um we've had some discussions and we
 
05:48:04.830 --> 05:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
talk about going to jail and I know that
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
felonies mean that you go to prison um
 
05:48:10.548 --> 05:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
what's your experience for people that
 
05:48:12.628 --> 05:48:12.638 align:start position:0%
are first offenders and they get the
 
05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
benefit of whatever the judicial system
 
05:48:18.708 --> 05:48:18.718 align:start position:0%
does for them that people actually go to
 
05:48:21.468 --> 05:48:21.478 align:start position:0%
county jails and have get are able to be
 
05:48:23.868 --> 05:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
successfully rehabilitated
 
05:48:26.270 --> 05:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
there thank you for your question and in
 
05:48:27.868 --> 05:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
my experience again when we're talking
 
05:48:30.070 --> 05:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
about uh personal use quantities of
 
05:48:32.830 --> 05:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
drugs that are not to the level that
 
05:48:35.310 --> 05:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about in this bill in 511
 
05:48:37.990 --> 05:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
those folks again are it into drug court
 
05:48:40.910 --> 05:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
um there often times prosecutors know
 
05:48:43.230 --> 05:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
that these folks um who are involved in
 
05:48:45.070 --> 05:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
shoplifting let's say that we see in
 
05:48:47.150 --> 05:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
property crime that end up in domestic
 
05:48:48.948 --> 05:48:48.958 align:start position:0%
violence cases that have an underlying
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
substance abuse problem we work very
 
05:48:52.468 --> 05:48:52.478 align:start position:0%
hard in law enforcement to get those
 
05:48:54.190 --> 05:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
people into the types of programs that
 
05:48:58.030 --> 05:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
they need but the Leverage is um that if
 
05:49:00.310 --> 05:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
they don't complete or they don't put
 
05:49:02.468 --> 05:49:02.478 align:start position:0%
their shoulder to the grindstone with
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
respect to a treatment program that the
 
05:49:07.110 --> 05:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
government has leveraged to exert
 
05:49:09.548 --> 05:49:09.558 align:start position:0%
control so that the individual is forced
 
05:49:11.590 --> 05:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
into and hopefully forced into an
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based treatment
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
program followup Mr chairman represent
 
05:49:19.830 --> 05:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
Newman you recognize for a followup yes
 
05:49:24.788 --> 05:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
sir um so that would they still have
 
05:49:28.350 --> 05:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
leverage if in fact that the penalty was
 
05:49:31.390 --> 05:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
was one that would not put them in state
 
05:49:33.868 --> 05:49:33.878 align:start position:0%
prison uh no because there's no there's
 
05:49:36.390 --> 05:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
no incentive uh there is no incentive
 
05:49:40.270 --> 05:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
for or someone to who's facing a Class B
 
05:49:42.030 --> 05:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to follow the law because
 
05:49:43.350 --> 05:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we see that they don't
 
05:49:46.150 --> 05:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
because they know that effectively a
 
05:49:49.310 --> 05:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor um results in no
 
05:49:52.750 --> 05:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
jail time and usually maybe in a low um
 
05:49:56.788 --> 05:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
Financial crime or fine so uh in order
 
05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people do what the
 
05:50:01.750 --> 05:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
government wants Society not government
 
05:50:04.590 --> 05:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
Society wants them to do which is um get
 
05:50:07.548 --> 05:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
better um and treat the problem
 
05:50:09.788 --> 05:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
uh in often cases we need that leverage
 
05:50:12.430 --> 05:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the individual follows
 
05:50:17.430 --> 05:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:20.468 --> 05:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
you see no further hands raised the
 
05:50:22.150 --> 05:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
witness is excused I want to thank you
 
05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:50:25.830 --> 05:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you if there are any
 
05:50:27.270 --> 05:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
members of the public who have not
 
05:50:27.280 --> 05:50:28.590 align:start position:0%
members of the public who have not
testified

05:50:28.590 --> 05:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
testified
 
05:50:28.600 --> 05:50:30.390 align:start position:0%
testified
already

05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
that uh wish to speak please raise your
 
05:50:32.878 --> 05:50:40.548 align:start position:0%

05:50:44.270 --> 05:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
leoy I got that right yes bki thank you
 
05:50:46.670 --> 05:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
so much for uh giving me an opportunity
 
05:50:50.270 --> 05:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
to speak my name is Leo bitki I'm uh on
 
05:50:52.030 --> 05:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
faculty of the law school and school of
 
05:50:53.350 --> 05:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
health sciences at North Eastern
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
University just
 
05:50:58.750 --> 05:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
south uh of New Hampshire in Boston and
 
05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say a few words about
 
05:51:05.948 --> 05:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
um uh my my research focuses on the
 
05:51:07.230 --> 05:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
overdose crisis
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the legal and policy measures to
 
05:51:12.270 --> 05:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
address it and we've done a lot of
 
05:51:17.310 --> 05:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
research on laws such as this um we
 
05:51:19.310 --> 05:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
broadly term them drug induced homicide
 
05:51:22.270 --> 05:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
laws or uh drug delivery resoling death
 
05:51:24.948 --> 05:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
laws uh throughout the United States
 
05:51:27.150 --> 05:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
these laws have been proliferating in
 
05:51:29.830 --> 05:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
response to the overdose crisis um for
 
05:51:32.150 --> 05:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
many of the reasons that folks have
 
05:51:36.670 --> 05:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
flagged um and uh We've evaluated their
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
impact from a public health perspective
 
05:51:40.590 --> 05:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
so obviously there's different reasons
 
05:51:43.948 --> 05:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
to you know pass laws like this such as
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know victim's rights rationale
 
05:51:48.430 --> 05:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
and kind of Retribution rationale but
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
from a public health perspective um
 
05:51:52.468 --> 05:51:52.478 align:start position:0%
we've looked at the impact of these laws
 
05:51:54.910 --> 05:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
and found that generally as a public
 
05:51:57.948 --> 05:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
health measure they do not um they're
 
05:52:00.708 --> 05:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
not effective in addressing overdose um
 
05:52:03.190 --> 05:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
so even just uh looking at the numbers
 
05:52:04.830 --> 05:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh states that have passed similar laws
 
05:52:07.150 --> 05:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
do not see overdose
 
05:52:10.628 --> 05:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh decrease they actually see typically
 
05:52:14.670 --> 05:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh increases in overdose on uh the uh
 
05:52:16.910 --> 05:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
amount of about 7 to
 
05:52:21.390 --> 05:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
10% and the uh mechanisms for this uh
 
05:52:23.628 --> 05:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
you know we can only posit that uh some
 
05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
of the ways in which laws such as this
 
05:52:28.910 --> 05:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh may increase overdose is the
 
05:52:31.590 --> 05:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
following so one of the ways in which um
 
05:52:34.788 --> 05:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
they may be counterproductive
 
05:52:38.468 --> 05:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
is do have to is a uh the testimony is
 
05:52:40.350 --> 05:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
limited to one minute You' almost
 
05:52:42.070 --> 05:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
reached two minutes so I do have to
 
05:52:44.708 --> 05:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
suspend the testimony however you the
 
05:52:45.910 --> 05:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
witness will be permitted to answer
 
05:52:47.628 --> 05:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
questions representative Hopper thank
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um thank you uh for
 
05:52:54.590 --> 05:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question how can they be um
 
05:52:56.910 --> 05:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
the last statement
 
05:52:59.590 --> 05:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
was how how can they be
 
05:53:02.310 --> 05:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
counterproductive so yeah I apologize
 
05:53:04.670 --> 05:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
that I uh wasn't aware of the time limit
 
05:53:07.750 --> 05:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
but um they're counterproductive in in
 
05:53:11.350 --> 05:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh several ways one um we know that many
 
05:53:13.830 --> 05:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
of the overdoses that are witnessed um
 
05:53:16.548 --> 05:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
help is not summoned and the person ends
 
05:53:19.590 --> 05:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
up dying um one of the reasons why to
 
05:53:21.708 --> 05:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
top reason based on surveys why people
 
05:53:25.230 --> 05:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
don't summon help is because of legal
 
05:53:28.868 --> 05:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
repercussions and when a law such as
 
05:53:33.310 --> 05:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
this is passed um the public awareness
 
05:53:37.110 --> 05:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
that a lot of um that that gets uh sort
 
05:53:40.750 --> 05:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
of affected in terms of public media
 
05:53:42.628 --> 05:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
outreach and prosecutors talking about
 
05:53:46.110 --> 05:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
these laws is people get uh those legal
 
05:53:48.670 --> 05:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
concerns get aggravated and people are
 
05:53:51.310 --> 05:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
not uh motivated to seek help during an
 
05:53:54.910 --> 05:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
overdose event so that's that's one of
 
05:53:54.920 --> 05:53:55.948 align:start position:0%
overdose event so that's that's one of
the

05:53:55.948 --> 05:53:55.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:53:58.788 --> 05:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
ways um I can I can keep going I don't
 
05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
know how much time I have but Newman you
 
05:54:02.670 --> 05:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
recognize for a
 
05:54:05.990 --> 05:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh your
 
05:54:08.150 --> 05:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
last comment it seems like most of your
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
research had to do with preventing
 
05:54:15.070 --> 05:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
overdoses and um did you uh have you has
 
05:54:18.670 --> 05:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
your research addressed the the question
 
05:54:22.830 --> 05:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
of people that referencing that towards
 
05:54:24.948 --> 05:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
trying to provide successful recovery
 
05:54:26.510 --> 05:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities to
 
05:54:28.830 --> 05:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
people representative I think that's a
 
05:54:30.788 --> 05:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
really important question I as was
 
05:54:33.868 --> 05:54:33.878 align:start position:0%
mentioned I think uh it was a uh the
 
05:54:36.510 --> 05:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
witness who had talked about the uh
 
05:54:40.708 --> 05:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
importance of um giving folks access to
 
05:54:42.510 --> 05:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
evidence-based drug
 
05:54:45.670 --> 05:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
treatment and uh we know that
 
05:54:47.190 --> 05:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in New Hampshire as in
 
05:54:50.390 --> 05:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
many other places um such treatment is
 
05:54:52.350 --> 05:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
is typically not available for people
 
05:54:55.030 --> 05:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
who are incarcerated so um to the extent
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
that people get um incarcerated based on
 
05:55:01.510 --> 05:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
these laws as well as others uh for drug
 
05:55:03.670 --> 05:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
dealing a lot of those folks are
 
05:55:06.788 --> 05:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
actually using and have addiction issues
 
05:55:09.830 --> 05:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
and what happens is they go into the
 
05:55:12.070 --> 05:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system they do not
 
05:55:14.628 --> 05:55:14.638 align:start position:0%
receive treatment and when they uh are
 
05:55:16.910 --> 05:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
released they overdose and die at really
 
05:55:19.708 --> 05:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
high rates so we know that the rate of
 
05:55:21.230 --> 05:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
Overdose among people who had been
 
05:55:25.150 --> 05:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated is about um 120 to 130
 
05:55:27.548 --> 05:55:27.558 align:start position:0%
times the background rate in the first
 
05:55:30.030 --> 05:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
six weeks after
 
05:55:32.430 --> 05:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
incarceration thank you for your
 
05:55:37.310 --> 05:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:40.150 --> 05:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
No Hands raised witness is
 
05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
excused excuse me representative
 
05:55:45.628 --> 05:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
board thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
05:55:47.590 --> 05:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
question as we heard earlier um uh
 
05:55:54.270 --> 05:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
having the uh the penalty of a felony
 
05:55:56.788 --> 05:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
over their heads are one of the reasons
 
05:56:00.190 --> 05:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
that people uh uh go to drug
 
05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
court and I think New Hampshire's drug
 
05:56:10.070 --> 05:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
court uh has a fairly successful uh uh
 
05:56:13.110 --> 05:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
ratio so if we redu got rid of the
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
felony uh penalty do you think that uh
 
05:56:19.510 --> 05:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
we would still have that kind of
 
05:56:21.628 --> 05:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
success representative I think this is a
 
05:56:23.708 --> 05:56:23.718 align:start position:0%
really important question I I I think
 
05:56:27.310 --> 05:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
that it is absolutely critical to have
 
05:56:30.070 --> 05:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh a drug court system that provides
 
05:56:34.230 --> 05:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
access to um uh evidence-based
 
05:56:35.750 --> 05:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
scientific treatment and New Hampshire
 
05:56:37.390 --> 05:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
has made great great strides in that
 
05:56:39.628 --> 05:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
direction I think though it's also
 
05:56:43.270 --> 05:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
really critical to have access to um
 
05:56:45.788 --> 05:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
such treatment on demand in a community
 
05:56:50.230 --> 05:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
in other words um in addition to
 
05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
improving the way in which the criminal
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
legal system deals with people with with
 
05:56:56.628 --> 05:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
addiction we need to have other
 
05:56:58.070 --> 05:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to access
 
05:57:01.708 --> 05:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
treatment that is free and on demand and
 
05:57:06.390 --> 05:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
as as low barrier as possible um in my
 
05:57:10.270 --> 05:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
view forcing people into treatment um
 
05:57:12.190 --> 05:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
and this is not actually my view this is
 
05:57:14.190 --> 05:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
based on on scientific research there's
 
05:57:17.590 --> 05:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
a a concept called intrinsic motivation
 
05:57:20.590 --> 05:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
which is that a person needs to want to
 
05:57:23.190 --> 05:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
get help and that's when treatment works
 
05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
best and so providing opportunities for
 
05:57:27.788 --> 05:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
people to access treatment when they're
 
05:57:30.590 --> 05:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
ready and willing to do so is the best
 
05:57:32.350 --> 05:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
chance that we have for people to find
 
05:57:36.190 --> 05:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
recovery whereas to uh do so through
 
05:57:36.200 --> 05:57:37.230 align:start position:0%
recovery whereas to uh do so through
through

05:57:37.230 --> 05:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:57:40.670 --> 05:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
coercion um is not as effective and
 
05:57:43.310 --> 05:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh the the failure rate is
 
05:57:45.990 --> 05:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
high much higher in those circumstances
 
05:57:48.868 --> 05:57:48.878 align:start position:0%
so uh to your question I don't think
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
that um sort of increasing the penalties
 
05:57:54.230 --> 05:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
that hang over people's heads is the way
 
05:57:56.830 --> 05:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
to go I think the way to go is to invest
 
05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
in a variety of Pathways as many as
 
05:58:01.310 --> 05:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
possible to get folks help when they
 
05:58:01.320 --> 05:58:04.830 align:start position:0%
possible to get folks help when they
need

05:58:04.830 --> 05:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:07.070 --> 05:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
it recn
 
05:58:10.350 --> 05:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
follow thank you CH thank you for taking
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
my question um you may have realiz may
 
05:58:17.030 --> 05:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
not realize we just passed a bill
 
05:58:21.270 --> 05:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
615 who which really uh allows uh the
 
05:58:24.190 --> 05:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
first uh offense for simple possession
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
of any drug to be a uh
 
05:58:32.510 --> 05:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor but further uh uh
 
05:58:37.310 --> 05:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
convictions become felonies so if we use
 
05:58:42.190 --> 05:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
the uh first offense as incentive to uh
 
05:58:45.190 --> 05:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
have people seek treatment but they refu
 
05:58:48.030 --> 05:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
they do they fail to and their the
 
05:58:50.990 --> 05:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
second time they are faced with a felony
 
05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
then we are
 
05:58:56.628 --> 05:58:56.638 align:start position:0%
basically uh forcing them into a uh drug
 
05:58:56.638 --> 05:58:58.670 align:start position:0%
basically uh forcing them into a uh drug
court

05:58:58.670 --> 05:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
court
 
05:59:04.030 --> 05:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:07.110 --> 05:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
Worlds I I mean I'm a big believer thank
 
05:59:09.070 --> 05:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
you for the question I'm a big believer
 
05:59:13.468 --> 05:59:13.478 align:start position:0%
in just uh you know all all possible
 
05:59:16.590 --> 05:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
doorways as many as many different paths
 
05:59:18.788 --> 05:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
as possible for people to get assistance
 
05:59:23.110 --> 05:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
and support um you know I I I don't want
 
05:59:25.670 --> 05:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
to comment on the sort of the priorities
 
05:59:28.390 --> 05:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the legislature and and the I have
 
05:59:30.788 --> 05:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
not read the bill that you cited I
 
05:59:35.548 --> 05:59:35.558 align:start position:0%
apologize um I I think that making
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
treatment available through the drug
 
05:59:41.070 --> 05:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
court system is a really important
 
05:59:44.590 --> 05:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
priority and I I certainly support um
 
05:59:46.788 --> 05:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
doing so for felony charges as well as
 
05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
mruna charges I will cite some research
 
05:59:54.030 --> 05:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
from um that came out last year from
 
05:59:55.670 --> 05:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia where they looked at
 
05:59:58.590 --> 05:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
treatment Court um outcomes so they what
 
06:00:01.750 --> 06:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
they did is they uh essentially did a
 
06:00:04.150 --> 06:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
retrospective review of everyone who had
 
06:00:06.468 --> 06:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
overdosed in Philadelphia for the year
 
06:00:07.468 --> 06:00:07.478 align:start position:0%
I think it was
 
06:00:10.830 --> 06:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
2017 and they assessed whether or not
 
06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
where were the touch points where did we
 
06:00:14.750 --> 06:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
miss an opportunity for that person who
 
06:00:17.390 --> 06:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
had overdosed and they found that um
 
06:00:20.468 --> 06:00:20.478 align:start position:0%
about 80% of the folks who had overdosed
 
06:00:22.310 --> 06:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
had a contact with the criminal legal
 
06:00:25.350 --> 06:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
system at some point over the last 18
 
06:00:31.150 --> 06:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
months so there's a lot of missed
 
06:00:34.430 --> 06:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity um in in in Philadelphia the
 
06:00:36.590 --> 06:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
their treatment Court was narrow had
 
06:00:39.390 --> 06:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
narrow eligibility requirements that did
 
06:00:41.150 --> 06:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
not allow folks who were repeat
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
offenders or had a violent um offense or
 
06:00:46.510 --> 06:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
other kinds of considerations they'
 
06:00:49.070 --> 06:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
eliminated eligibility for those people
 
06:00:51.788 --> 06:00:51.798 align:start position:0%
and so it sounds like what New Hampshire
 
06:00:54.910 --> 06:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
is doing is it it is using those
 
06:00:58.510 --> 06:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility CR criteria widely and not
 
06:01:00.750 --> 06:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
kind of eliminating the opportunity for
 
06:01:03.948 --> 06:01:03.958 align:start position:0%
people with more serious offenses to get
 
06:01:05.548 --> 06:01:05.558 align:start position:0%
access to treatment and I think that's a
 
06:01:07.990 --> 06:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
really important lesson that we have to
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
learn is that you know it's not just a
 
06:01:13.070 --> 06:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
low-level and sort of firsttime offenses
 
06:01:15.468 --> 06:01:15.478 align:start position:0%
in fact many people who have serious
 
06:01:17.910 --> 06:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
addiction issues have a really serious
 
06:01:20.868 --> 06:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
record and that doesn't mean that they
 
06:01:23.788 --> 06:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
can't find recovery it just means that
 
06:01:26.788 --> 06:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
we need to expand our thinking as far as
 
06:01:29.350 --> 06:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
who is eligible who can benefit from
 
06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
these kinds of
 
06:01:36.670 --> 06:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:38.430 --> 06:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
see no additional hands raised the
 
06:01:40.590 --> 06:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
witness is excused want to thank you for

testimony sorry you're going to hear
 
06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
testimony from one of my constituents
 
06:05:09.990 --> 06:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
Art Williams who is a retired detective
 
06:05:12.750 --> 06:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh with more than 20 years of service uh
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
from the suers police department who is
 
06:05:16.270 --> 06:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
currently a private investigator
 
06:05:19.468 --> 06:05:19.478 align:start position:0%
representing Donna Barrett a mother who
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
lost her son back in 2017 in a drug deal
 
06:05:25.830 --> 06:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
where he was killed Donna Barrett is
 
06:05:28.830 --> 06:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
also here today to testify so basically
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
in short uh I want to add
 
06:05:37.670 --> 06:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to add to the law so drug
 
06:05:41.150 --> 06:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
dealers are not protected and here's an
 
06:05:44.390 --> 06:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
example so if I want if I went to a drug
 
06:05:47.310 --> 06:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
dealer's house to buy
 
06:05:51.948 --> 06:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
drugs and something went down and I was
 
06:05:55.868 --> 06:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
killed at that person's house then they
 
06:05:59.150 --> 06:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
could actually go off scotf free uh from
 
06:06:00.350 --> 06:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
the current
 
06:06:04.310 --> 06:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
law um and what I'm trying to do is I'm
 
06:06:06.628 --> 06:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
trying to make them accountable
 
06:06:10.030 --> 06:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh for their actions here um and I think
 
06:06:14.948 --> 06:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
to I think that um uh I would love if I
 
06:06:17.990 --> 06:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
could turn it over um to Donna Barrett
 
06:06:20.990 --> 06:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
the mother of the the mother of the son
 
06:06:23.030 --> 06:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
that was lost
 
06:06:26.110 --> 06:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
um and Mr chairman we are all here in
 
06:06:29.708 --> 06:06:29.718 align:start position:0%
the same room using the same computer uh
 
06:06:31.590 --> 06:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
I would I would beg you if you could
 
06:06:35.830 --> 06:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
please allow uh Donna to talk and then
 
06:06:39.190 --> 06:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
um Art Williams uh it would definitely
 
06:06:41.670 --> 06:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh make the the line and the pattern
 
06:06:44.548 --> 06:06:44.558 align:start position:0%
here uh very clearable if that's
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
possible we we can accommodate that
 
06:06:48.510 --> 06:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent the only thing I
 
06:06:50.230 --> 06:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
asked is that for each
 
06:06:52.750 --> 06:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
member for each each witness that is in
 
06:06:54.990 --> 06:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
with you to have them State their full
 
06:06:57.510 --> 06:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
name U for the record is whether they're
 
06:06:57.520 --> 06:06:58.548 align:start position:0%

in
 
06:07:00.708 --> 06:07:00.718 align:start position:0%
support in opposition of the bill just

06:07:05.910 --> 06:07:05.920 align:start position:0%

of the representative she's willing to
 
06:07:57.590 --> 06:07:57.600 align:start position:0%

06:08:00.430 --> 06:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Representative
 
06:08:05.070 --> 06:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
Vincent um for coming before us today
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
having this over um is it is my
 
06:08:10.750 --> 06:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
understanding correct
 
06:08:16.270 --> 06:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
that this would U remove in in cases
 
06:08:18.628 --> 06:08:18.638 align:start position:0%
involving uh drug
 
06:08:21.150 --> 06:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
transactions it would make it so that
 
06:08:24.708 --> 06:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
the seller of the drugs would not be
 
06:08:27.030 --> 06:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
able to claim
 
06:08:29.350 --> 06:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
self-defense if there is some sort of
 
06:08:31.830 --> 06:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
altercation and deadly forces use it's
 
06:08:34.230 --> 06:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
the act of the dealing of or the sale of
 
06:08:37.948 --> 06:08:37.958 align:start position:0%
drugs that hinders the
 
06:08:37.958 --> 06:08:39.548 align:start position:0%
drugs that hinders the
self-defense

06:08:39.548 --> 06:08:39.558 align:start position:0%
self-defense
 
06:08:42.430 --> 06:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
um justification am I right and that's
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill would
 
06:08:47.150 --> 06:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
do thank you for your uh question
 
06:08:49.270 --> 06:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative Conley uh yes I'm
 
06:08:50.830 --> 06:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
believing that's what it what it would
 
06:08:55.990 --> 06:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
do um so I I think that you know I think
 
06:08:59.670 --> 06:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
that the real uh expert here is um going
 
06:09:02.070 --> 06:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
to be uh former detective or retired
 
06:09:05.590 --> 06:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
detective um uh Art Williams uh he was
 
06:09:08.390 --> 06:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
my constituent when he came to me uh in
 
06:09:11.350 --> 06:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
this matter and um I think he would
 
06:09:13.830 --> 06:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
really be the one uh to ask that
 
06:09:18.070 --> 06:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
question to but I do believe uh that uh
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's right this would not protect uh
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
the the drug dealer um let's face it um
 
06:09:29.750 --> 06:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
like I said before if um if I'm a drug
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
dealer and I have several people coming
 
06:09:35.868 --> 06:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
to my house and I'm selling drugs from
 
06:09:35.878 --> 06:09:36.788 align:start position:0%
to my house and I'm selling drugs from
my

06:09:36.788 --> 06:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:09:41.150 --> 06:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
house and say that's 20 people 30 people
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
in in in two days and something goes
 
06:09:48.948 --> 06:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
wrong and as a drug dealer uh in my
 
06:09:52.070 --> 06:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
house I killed a person uh because I
 
06:09:54.390 --> 06:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
didn't like what was going on in this in
 
06:09:55.788 --> 06:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
this illegal
 
06:09:59.628 --> 06:09:59.638 align:start position:0%
sale uh I just think that that would
 
06:10:03.190 --> 06:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
protect the drug dealer um that's that's
 
06:10:04.628 --> 06:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
how I feel and that's what this that's
 
06:10:06.270 --> 06:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
what this is all about about this bill
 
06:10:08.510 --> 06:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
is thank you
 
06:10:10.390 --> 06:10:10.400 align:start position:0%

how other people have described him to
 
06:11:12.708 --> 06:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
me um Michael was easygoing he was
 
06:11:14.868 --> 06:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and generous he was
 
06:11:16.830 --> 06:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
constantly doing things for
 
06:11:19.390 --> 06:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
others I want to give you a few example
 
06:11:22.230 --> 06:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
of remembrances people had told me if
 
06:11:24.270 --> 06:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
you were moving and this was a true case
 
06:11:26.750 --> 06:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
scenario uh everybody else bails out on

06:11:32.230 --> 06:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
help you move no matter how difficult or
 
06:11:34.910 --> 06:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
unpleasant the job was I'm sorry a
 
06:11:36.390 --> 06:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
friend of of his came to me and told me
 
06:11:38.070 --> 06:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
that there was a time when he needed
 
06:11:40.190 --> 06:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
baby formula he wasn't able to pay for
 
06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
it my son helped him to pay for it and
 
06:11:44.230 --> 06:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
they bought the formula together he also
 
06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
told me that my son had expressed how he
 
06:11:50.628 --> 06:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to have a child one day another
 
06:11:52.190 --> 06:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
person came to me and told me when he
 
06:11:53.910 --> 06:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
was the new kid in school and although
 
06:11:56.310 --> 06:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
this is back in high school you know how
 
06:11:58.510 --> 06:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
it feels when you're the new kid and my
 
06:12:00.390 --> 06:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
son would be the first to say hello and
 
06:12:02.270 --> 06:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
befriend him and he remembers it after
 
06:12:03.548 --> 06:12:03.558 align:start position:0%
all these
 
06:12:06.468 --> 06:12:06.478 align:start position:0%
years these are just few examples of how
 
06:12:08.708 --> 06:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
Michael touched people's lives and I
 
06:12:10.310 --> 06:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
know I can't go on but there are many
 
06:12:13.468 --> 06:12:13.478 align:start position:0%
more so now I have to go on and talk to
 
06:12:16.190 --> 06:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
you about why I think House Bill 603 is
 
06:12:18.670 --> 06:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
so important along with the amendment
 
06:12:20.310 --> 06:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
because my son Michael was brutally
 
06:12:23.390 --> 06:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
murdered by a drug dealer after he was
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
sold cocaine my son was 22 at the time
 
06:12:30.670 --> 06:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a sequence of the
 
06:12:33.948 --> 06:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
event a person arranged a
 
06:12:36.990 --> 06:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
sale um and brought Michael to the drug
 
06:12:39.628 --> 06:12:39.638 align:start position:0%
dealer's house and left him there
 
06:12:42.270 --> 06:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
cocaine was delivered to the Dealer's
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
house a short time before Michael
 
06:12:47.548 --> 06:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
arrived Michael and the drug dealer
 
06:12:47.558 --> 06:12:48.990 align:start position:0%
arrived Michael and the drug dealer
ingested

06:12:48.990 --> 06:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
ingested
 
06:12:52.468 --> 06:12:52.478 align:start position:0%
cocaine after a while an altercation or
 
06:12:54.948 --> 06:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
some sort of disturbance occurred
 
06:12:58.150 --> 06:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
Michael was stabbed to death by the drug
 
06:13:01.110 --> 06:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
dealer Michael sustained multiple stab
 
06:13:04.430 --> 06:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
wounds a compound fractured to his leg
 
06:13:06.548 --> 06:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
one for trauma to his head and many
 
06:13:09.270 --> 06:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
other injuries and contusions only
 
06:13:10.910 --> 06:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
Michael the drug dealer in the drug
 
06:13:13.708 --> 06:13:13.718 align:start position:0%
dealers room were at the house the Time
 
06:13:16.270 --> 06:13:16.280 align:start position:0%
Michael was killed the drug deal and his
 
06:13:18.990 --> 06:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
roommate sustained no
 
06:13:21.270 --> 06:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
injuries I I would also like to tell you
 
06:13:23.788 --> 06:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
about the 911 call at this time and I
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
would like to give my support to the
 
06:13:28.670 --> 06:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
amendment to the 911 in Michael's case
 
06:13:30.830 --> 06:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
the drug dealer and his roommate had the
 
06:13:33.868 --> 06:13:33.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity to call 911 but they delayed
 
06:13:36.190 --> 06:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
they never called for M and only
 
06:13:38.910 --> 06:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
reluctantly called for the police the
 
06:13:41.670 --> 06:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
911 caller was described by Dispatch as
 
06:13:43.350 --> 06:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
hostile and
 
06:13:45.390 --> 06:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
uncooperative when police arrived
 
06:13:47.910 --> 06:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
Michael was found unconscious and with
 
06:13:51.190 --> 06:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
no pelts the police had to call for
 
06:13:54.030 --> 06:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
EMS Michael's life could have been saved
 
06:13:55.708 --> 06:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
if the drug dealer and the roommate had
 
06:13:58.468 --> 06:13:58.478 align:start position:0%
not delayed in calling 911 and requested
 
06:14:01.230 --> 06:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
an ambulance the 911 call was neither
 
06:14:03.670 --> 06:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
timely or made in good faith and my son
 
06:14:05.548 --> 06:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
lost his life
 
06:14:07.990 --> 06:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
under current law no charges were
 
06:14:11.110 --> 06:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
brought against anyone in this case two
 
06:14:13.310 --> 06:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
people were involved in Michael's
 
06:14:15.990 --> 06:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
death and three people involved in the
 
06:14:19.070 --> 06:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
cocaine deal under Michael's law
 
06:14:21.310 --> 06:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
everyone in the cocaine sale could have
 
06:14:23.868 --> 06:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
been held culpable I asked you if this
 
06:14:26.150 --> 06:14:26.160 align:start position:0%

06:14:28.468 --> 06:14:28.478 align:start position:0%

good person
 
06:14:38.270 --> 06:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
he didn't have to lose his life that
 
06:14:40.830 --> 06:14:40.840 align:start position:0%

friends and family he had hopes and
 
06:14:47.190 --> 06:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
goals for the future and I know he would
 
06:14:49.628 --> 06:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
have achieved those and fulfilled those
 
06:14:51.948 --> 06:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
we love him and we miss
 
06:14:54.310 --> 06:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
him I'm cading with
 
06:14:56.910 --> 06:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
you as a mother to support House Bill
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
603 in its 911 Amendment our sons and
 
06:15:02.190 --> 06:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
daughters are dying at an alarming rape
 
06:15:03.830 --> 06:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
due to the direct actions of drug
 
06:15:06.510 --> 06:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
dealers in the secondary effects of the
 
06:15:08.590 --> 06:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
drugs they sell drug dealers are
 
06:15:09.990 --> 06:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
committing crimes and they need to be
 
06:15:11.788 --> 06:15:11.798 align:start position:0%
sent a clear message knowing that they
 
06:15:13.750 --> 06:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
will be held
 
06:15:16.110 --> 06:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
accountable House Bill 603 and its
 
06:15:18.350 --> 06:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment would bring some justice to
 
06:15:20.708 --> 06:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
Michael's death and I believe it would
 
06:15:22.390 --> 06:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
help other families who find themselves
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the same situation being the person
 
06:15:27.910 --> 06:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
Michael was I know we would have wanted
 
06:15:30.310 --> 06:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
this to happen and in honor of my son
 
06:15:32.030 --> 06:15:32.040 align:start position:0%

General's um a justifiable homicide

according to them by the cocaine
 
06:18:40.390 --> 06:18:40.400 align:start position:0%

to thank you in advance for taking
 
06:20:46.548 --> 06:20:46.558 align:start position:0%
question uh when I when I read uh
 
06:20:49.468 --> 06:20:49.478 align:start position:0%
subsection C it it had the sale the
 
06:20:51.510 --> 06:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
transfer injection or
 
06:20:54.788 --> 06:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
inest and I I understand the sale to be
 
06:20:54.798 --> 06:20:55.548 align:start position:0%
inest and I I understand the sale to be
it

06:20:55.548 --> 06:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:20:58.030 --> 06:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
says if it if it's directly or
 
06:21:02.548 --> 06:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
indirectly related uh to the sale
 
06:21:04.868 --> 06:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
transer I when I was reading this I
 
06:21:06.830 --> 06:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
anticip my anticipation was obviously
 
06:21:09.468 --> 06:21:09.478 align:start position:0%
not not correct but I was anticipating
 
06:21:10.990 --> 06:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
this had to do where someone would maybe
 
06:21:12.230 --> 06:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
pass away from
 
06:21:14.830 --> 06:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
overdose uh
 
06:21:17.030 --> 06:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
would which is not the case that
 
06:21:18.468 --> 06:21:18.478 align:start position:0%
obviously the examp provide to us I'm
 
06:21:22.708 --> 06:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
just asking would that section apply to
 
06:21:25.670 --> 06:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
overdose section uh overdoses as
 
06:21:25.680 --> 06:21:30.390 align:start position:0%
overdose section uh overdoses as
well

06:21:30.390 --> 06:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:37.510 --> 06:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:39.948 --> 06:21:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
testimony in detective if you wish to
 
06:21:43.910 --> 06:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
provide any testimony I know you answer
 
06:21:46.070 --> 06:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
the question to start we allow you one
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
one minute okay um there's three parts
 
06:21:52.708 --> 06:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
to the proposal when we were looking at
 
06:21:54.270 --> 06:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
Barrett case we were looking at some of
 
06:21:57.190 --> 06:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
the deficiencies in the laws and
 
06:21:59.628 --> 06:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
Representative Vincent had touched on it
 
06:22:03.070 --> 06:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
before that deadly forces the proposal
 
06:22:05.110 --> 06:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
would be that deadly force is not not
 
06:22:09.270 --> 06:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
authorized in the sale of a controlled
 
06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
drug by either the buyer or the seller
 
06:22:13.510 --> 06:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that
 
06:22:18.628 --> 06:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
if any drug activity goes on in a house
 
06:22:21.110 --> 06:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
um that negates any deadly force because
 
06:22:22.708 --> 06:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
the violence that surround some of those
 
06:22:22.718 --> 06:22:24.070 align:start position:0%
the violence that surround some of those
drug

06:22:24.070 --> 06:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
drug
 
06:22:28.750 --> 06:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
deals um I can only imagine what the
 
06:22:31.510 --> 06:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
consequences would be without
 
06:22:35.430 --> 06:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
it in some of these cases the other
 
06:22:37.750 --> 06:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment or proposal that change the
 
06:22:39.830 --> 06:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
language was in the
 
06:22:43.910 --> 06:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
um under the 318 the drug
 
06:22:43.920 --> 06:22:46.030 align:start position:0%
um under the 318 the drug
statutes

06:22:46.030 --> 06:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
06:22:48.548 --> 06:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
would make somebody strictly liable for
 
06:22:50.830 --> 06:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
the death Andor the conduct of
 
06:22:53.750 --> 06:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
another um I think we just heard about
 
06:22:56.310 --> 06:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
the case in London der where the young
 
06:22:58.670 --> 06:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
baby got a hold of some Fentanyl and
 
06:23:01.590 --> 06:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
passed away parents have been
 
06:23:05.030 --> 06:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
charged um person who delivered fenel
 
06:23:08.030 --> 06:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
could be charged as well under this I
 
06:23:08.040 --> 06:23:08.830 align:start position:0%
could be charged as well under this I
think

06:23:08.830 --> 06:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:23:08.840 --> 06:23:10.910 align:start position:0%
think
that's

06:23:10.910 --> 06:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:23:12.948 --> 06:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
um not
 
06:23:15.390 --> 06:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
inconsequential we're averaging over 400
 
06:23:17.070 --> 06:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
deaths a year for
 
06:23:19.948 --> 06:23:19.958 align:start position:0%
overdose that's 800 parents a year that
 
06:23:21.468 --> 06:23:21.478 align:start position:0%
are looking for
 
06:23:24.430 --> 06:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
answers um some of these
 
06:23:29.390 --> 06:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
proposals I think have been
 
06:23:31.708 --> 06:23:31.718 align:start position:0%
long in the coming I
 
06:23:35.190 --> 06:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
retired from active duty in 200 7 and
 
06:23:37.990 --> 06:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
I've just seen from the sidelines the
 
06:23:38.000 --> 06:23:41.230 align:start position:0%
I've just seen from the sidelines the
drug

06:23:41.230 --> 06:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:44.510 --> 06:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:47.590 --> 06:23:47.600 align:start position:0%

testimony I'm confused about the whole
 
06:24:05.910 --> 06:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
situation who initiated the altercation
 
06:24:08.350 --> 06:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
that ended up in the death of the young
 
06:24:13.788 --> 06:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
man do we know we do not know because
 
06:24:16.190 --> 06:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
the only two people who lived through
 
06:24:30.830 --> 06:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:36.390 --> 06:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:39.070 --> 06:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:42.990 --> 06:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'm representative TR thank you Mr chair
 
06:24:45.390 --> 06:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
06:24:47.868 --> 06:24:47.878 align:start position:0%
I I believe I believe I heard you
 
06:24:51.910 --> 06:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
testify that um under under the bill
 
06:24:56.230 --> 06:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
that we have before us it also includes
 
06:24:59.110 --> 06:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
overdoses my question
 
06:25:03.548 --> 06:25:03.558 align:start position:0%
is if a now without Before the bill as
 
06:25:07.910 --> 06:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
as the law is is now if a drug
 
06:25:10.868 --> 06:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
dealer gave somebody drugs they
 
06:25:13.390 --> 06:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
overdosed and died is not the drug
 
06:25:16.708 --> 06:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
dealer responsible for that overdose
 
06:25:19.990 --> 06:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:24.670 --> 06:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
are is the proposed change to the
 
06:25:28.430 --> 06:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
language says the death Andor conduct of
 
06:25:29.590 --> 06:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
another is
 
06:25:32.510 --> 06:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
defined which results in the injection
 
06:25:32.520 --> 06:25:34.390 align:start position:0%
defined which results in the injection
so

06:25:34.390 --> 06:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:36.468 --> 06:25:36.478 align:start position:0%
I guess what we're seeking
 
06:25:40.468 --> 06:25:40.478 align:start position:0%
is um it's kind of like the the bar that
 
06:25:43.548 --> 06:25:43.558 align:start position:0%
over serves the patron who goes out and
 
06:25:45.628 --> 06:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
kills somebody
 
06:25:52.110 --> 06:25:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:55.350 --> 06:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
another so if somebody becomes under the
 
06:25:58.548 --> 06:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
influence of a controlled drug goes and
 
06:26:00.910 --> 06:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
kills somebody else whoever supplied
 
06:26:02.468 --> 06:26:02.478 align:start position:0%
that drug is
 
06:26:04.990 --> 06:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
liable that's the easy way
 
06:26:05.000 --> 06:26:11.910 align:start position:0%
liable that's the easy way
explain

06:26:11.910 --> 06:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:14.390 --> 06:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
it for follow up thank you thank you Mr
 
06:26:16.548 --> 06:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:26:16.558 --> 06:26:18.110 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
again

06:26:18.110 --> 06:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:26:21.590 --> 06:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
so when the conduct causing the death is
 
06:26:24.990 --> 06:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly related so if a
 
06:26:29.070 --> 06:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:34.670 --> 06:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
heroin and a few days later that person
 
06:26:37.990 --> 06:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh had a bad reaction to heroin and kill
 
06:26:42.350 --> 06:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
somebody this bill would drug dealer
 
06:26:44.548 --> 06:26:44.558 align:start position:0%
responsible for what happened two or
 
06:26:47.190 --> 06:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
three days later I think there's a 12-h
 
06:26:55.548 --> 06:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:58.548 --> 06:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
conduct you recognize the follow I I I'm
 
06:27:00.390 --> 06:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
and where was that where is that where
 
06:27:05.948 --> 06:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:07.788 --> 06:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
where where is it
 
06:27:10.190 --> 06:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
written is it not written on the it's
 
06:27:11.708 --> 06:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
not written on here I think it had been
 
06:27:13.150 --> 06:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
written on here and I think it got
 
06:27:16.590 --> 06:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
removed oh I'm sorry it's apparently has
 
06:27:20.190 --> 06:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
been removed that was the um the
 
06:27:22.150 --> 06:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
original idea was it was a 12-h hour
 
06:27:24.628 --> 06:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
limit so there wouldn't be any confusion
 
06:27:24.638 --> 06:27:25.430 align:start position:0%
limit so there wouldn't be any confusion
as

06:27:25.430 --> 06:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:27:29.230 --> 06:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
to like the proposal that you said the
 
06:27:32.150 --> 06:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:36.390 --> 06:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:36.400 --> 06:27:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:27:37.910 --> 06:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:27:40.590 --> 06:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
tman thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:27:43.270 --> 06:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:27:47.670 --> 06:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:51.910 --> 06:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
here tell me if I'm right if if a drug
 
06:27:55.868 --> 06:27:55.878 align:start position:0%
dealer sells drugs he basically has
 
06:27:57.948 --> 06:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
essentially product
 
06:28:00.868 --> 06:28:00.878 align:start position:0%
liability for as long as that those
 
06:28:04.510 --> 06:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
drugs are in use and and in good be held
 
06:28:07.430 --> 06:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
liable this is for manslaughter if that
 
06:28:11.070 --> 06:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
person causes or or you dies of
 
06:28:17.190 --> 06:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:20.990 --> 06:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
correct good to me representative Conley
 
06:28:25.788 --> 06:28:25.798 align:start position:0%
thank youman thank you detective um this
 
06:28:27.230 --> 06:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
is I guess a follow up on my own
 
06:28:29.030 --> 06:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
question because I'm still this commit
 
06:28:30.788 --> 06:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
to dealt with RSA
 
06:28:35.030 --> 06:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
674 a lot this term and I'm still a
 
06:28:37.230 --> 06:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
little bit uncertain
 
06:28:40.708 --> 06:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
about how this proposal affects that
 
06:28:44.030 --> 06:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill and I wonder if the detective or
 
06:28:47.150 --> 06:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
the timee sponsor can offer some clarity
 
06:28:49.510 --> 06:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
I hope I'm not coming up the work with
 
06:28:51.548 --> 06:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
this question I'm still not sure what's
 
06:28:55.310 --> 06:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:58.468 --> 06:28:58.478 align:start position:0%
do it just add to
 
06:29:02.548 --> 06:29:02.558 align:start position:0%
it sorry I didn't quite get the question
 
06:29:06.910 --> 06:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:09.948 --> 06:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
hearing detective I'm going to try to
 
06:29:11.190 --> 06:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
communicate the question on behalf of
 
06:29:12.590 --> 06:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
Representative col please representative
 
06:29:13.948 --> 06:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
call give me a thumbs up or thumbs down
 
06:29:18.150 --> 06:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
if I do not cap intent of your question
 
06:29:19.590 --> 06:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
I believe representative coling was
 
06:29:24.190 --> 06:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
asking whether how would this uh Bill
 
06:29:25.510 --> 06:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:29:28.948 --> 06:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
63 change or impact the use of force
 
06:29:31.230 --> 06:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
06:29:34.670 --> 06:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
627 home 4
 
06:29:37.130 --> 06:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
specifically involved the use of deadly
 
06:29:37.140 --> 06:29:38.750 align:start position:0%
specifically involved the use of deadly
[Music]

06:29:38.750 --> 06:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:29:41.510 --> 06:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
for I think that I could best answer
 
06:29:43.430 --> 06:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
that this is Representative Vincent if
 
06:29:46.350 --> 06:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
you would allow me Mr
 
06:29:52.548 --> 06:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
chairman so yes so uh you know I
 
06:29:55.110 --> 06:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
understand that we're talking about the
 
06:29:57.830 --> 06:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
standard ground law and I understand
 
06:30:00.030 --> 06:30:00.040 align:start position:0%
that when you talk about stard ground
 
06:30:04.110 --> 06:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
law everybody gets all nervous about it
 
06:30:05.628 --> 06:30:05.638 align:start position:0%
I just want to let you know that this
 
06:30:08.990 --> 06:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
bill is in no way wants to change and I
 
06:30:10.990 --> 06:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
don't want this bill to change standard
 
06:30:15.390 --> 06:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
ground law at all what I want to do is I
 
06:30:16.830 --> 06:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
06:30:18.708 --> 06:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
add the
 
06:30:21.670 --> 06:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
non-protection of an illegal act such as
 
06:30:24.708 --> 06:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
a drug dealer because if a drug dealer
 
06:30:26.030 --> 06:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
is dealing
 
06:30:29.030 --> 06:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
drugs what are the chances of I get
 
06:30:34.310 --> 06:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
something that I don't like and I am uh
 
06:30:38.030 --> 06:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
not happy with what I have and then then
 
06:30:40.670 --> 06:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
then or the drug deal is mad at me and
 
06:30:44.628 --> 06:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
then he kills me and then claim stand
 
06:30:44.638 --> 06:30:45.548 align:start position:0%
then he kills me and then claim stand
your

06:30:45.548 --> 06:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:30:49.548 --> 06:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
ground I believe in stand your ground
 
06:30:55.110 --> 06:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
that a king or a queen is their castle
 
06:30:58.110 --> 06:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
and anybody to go in there I shouldn't
 
06:30:59.230 --> 06:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:31:03.468 --> 06:31:03.478 align:start position:0%
retreat however under a drug sale
 
06:31:03.478 --> 06:31:05.430 align:start position:0%
retreat however under a drug sale
activity

06:31:05.430 --> 06:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
activity
 
06:31:07.628 --> 06:31:07.638 align:start position:0%
that's all off in my
 
06:31:11.350 --> 06:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
opinion um but I am for stand your
 
06:31:12.830 --> 06:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
ground but I just think if you're doing
 
06:31:16.070 --> 06:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
a drug deal activity with is a mind
 
06:31:19.070 --> 06:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
altering substance use uh a sale of an
 
06:31:23.190 --> 06:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
illegal drug uh I don't think uh that's
 
06:31:27.190 --> 06:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh a robbery it could be robbery too and
 
06:31:29.388 --> 06:31:29.398 align:start position:0%
then the person that they're robbing
 
06:31:32.110 --> 06:31:32.120 align:start position:0%
that went to their house kills the
 
06:31:33.468 --> 06:31:33.478 align:start position:0%
person and then there's there's no
 
06:31:37.190 --> 06:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
ground to stand on I just um I just find
 
06:31:40.430 --> 06:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
that uh you know I understand that as
 
06:31:43.190 --> 06:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
lawmakers we try to think of every
 
06:31:47.510 --> 06:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
Avenue however sometimes we we don't get
 
06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
it all right and we come back to it like
 
06:31:52.070 --> 06:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
we are I think today and I I really
 
06:31:54.548 --> 06:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
respect and appreciate you uh letting me
 
06:31:56.910 --> 06:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
answer Mr chairman Representative
 
06:31:58.510 --> 06:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
Vincent the chair would have requireed
 
06:32:00.590 --> 06:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
one additional question I hope I didn't
 
06:32:05.070 --> 06:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
exceed my limitation of two questions
 
06:32:07.590 --> 06:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh just correct me about when I always
 
06:32:10.150 --> 06:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
look at the the standard
 
06:32:13.868 --> 06:32:13.878 align:start position:0%
ground protection under 6 RSA
 
06:32:17.468 --> 06:32:17.478 align:start position:0%
6274 that often implies that the uh
 
06:32:19.230 --> 06:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
person inside their home or standing
 
06:32:20.948 --> 06:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
their ground is
 
06:32:23.388 --> 06:32:23.398 align:start position:0%
not committing any type of illegal act
 
06:32:25.230 --> 06:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
of their own they are they have Clean
 
06:32:27.230 --> 06:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hands per se I'm not sure if that's
 
06:32:28.830 --> 06:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
clearly written in that
 
06:32:33.110 --> 06:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
RSA but is the spirit of what is trying
 
06:32:35.750 --> 06:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be accomplished is to basically if
 
06:32:39.110 --> 06:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
some you don't want someone using RSA
 
06:32:43.150 --> 06:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
627 4 to basically create a c use the
 
06:32:44.868 --> 06:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
castle doctor inside their home to
 
06:32:46.948 --> 06:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
facilitate a
 
06:32:52.948 --> 06:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:52.958 --> 06:33:00.388 align:start position:0%
 
correct

06:33:00.388 --> 06:33:00.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.548 --> 06:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
question you
 
06:33:04.548 --> 06:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
recogniz thank than you Mr chair I don't
 
06:33:05.990 --> 06:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
know if this is a followup to my
 
06:33:07.708 --> 06:33:07.718 align:start position:0%
previous question or my second question
 
06:33:09.628 --> 06:33:09.638 align:start position:0%
but anyway I've also looked at that
 
06:33:11.750 --> 06:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph and has spent a lot of time
 
06:33:13.750 --> 06:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much looking at
 
06:33:16.468 --> 06:33:16.478 align:start position:0%
6274 and I believe that the new
 
06:33:18.110 --> 06:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph because this is a completely
 
06:33:20.388 --> 06:33:20.398 align:start position:0%
new paragraph prohibits the use of
 
06:33:23.070 --> 06:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
deadly force in in those kinds of
 
06:33:26.510 --> 06:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
situations and I think that it also does
 
06:33:28.708 --> 06:33:28.718 align:start position:0%
not limit it to your own own Dem
 
06:33:30.750 --> 06:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
domicile I believe that that could be
 
06:33:33.270 --> 06:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
done anywhere so that's just my opinion
 
06:33:34.788 --> 06:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
of the bill and I'm wondering if the
 
06:33:37.190 --> 06:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
witnesses might or the prime sponsor
 
06:33:41.510 --> 06:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
might think that that's appropriate
 
06:33:51.548 --> 06:33:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:55.548 --> 06:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman did you want us to answer
 
06:33:58.190 --> 06:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
that I believe it was a a question by
 
06:34:00.708 --> 06:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
representative Newman the which the
 
06:34:04.670 --> 06:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
amendment is now being passed out um but
 
06:34:06.788 --> 06:34:06.798 align:start position:0%
you may respond to represent Newman and
 
06:34:09.868 --> 06:34:09.878 align:start position:0%

you so desire I'll let uh the Detective
 
06:34:14.670 --> 06:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
Williams answer that question yes the
 
06:34:16.548 --> 06:34:16.558 align:start position:0%
prior chair of this committee who I have
 
06:34:18.110 --> 06:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of respect for who I sered with
 
06:34:20.910 --> 06:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
last term did allow when we were meeting
 
06:34:23.270 --> 06:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
in person more than one witness to sit
 
06:34:25.350 --> 06:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
at with the sponsor of the bill so this
 
06:34:28.590 --> 06:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
is perfectly fine to kind of interchange
 
06:34:30.150 --> 06:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman we
 
06:34:33.150 --> 06:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um in answer to your
 
06:34:33.160 --> 06:34:34.468 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um in answer to your
question

06:34:34.468 --> 06:34:34.478 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:34:37.270 --> 06:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
the proposed law change would make
 
06:34:40.830 --> 06:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
deadly force unauthorized anywhere if it
 
06:34:43.270 --> 06:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
involved the use sale possession
 
06:34:47.150 --> 06:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
anything to do with controlled drugs
 
06:34:51.628 --> 06:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
so it's whether it's in a home
 
06:34:56.190 --> 06:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
and in public any place um it would just
 
06:34:58.190 --> 06:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
negate the
 
06:34:58.200 --> 06:35:00.230 align:start position:0%
negate the
self-defense

06:35:00.230 --> 06:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
self-defense
 
06:35:03.030 --> 06:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
because violence surrounding the illegal
 
06:35:07.190 --> 06:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
drugs is sale and possession of is not
 
06:35:07.200 --> 06:35:09.510 align:start position:0%
drugs is sale and possession of is not
authorized

06:35:09.510 --> 06:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
06:35:11.468 --> 06:35:11.478 align:start position:0%
anywhere and thank you very much for
 
06:35:13.708 --> 06:35:13.718 align:start position:0%

06:35:15.430 --> 06:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
opinion of what that paragraph was
 
06:35:23.548 --> 06:35:23.558 align:start position:0%

06:37:37.310 --> 06:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:37:39.670 --> 06:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
238 I'm introducing this bill because
 
06:37:42.030 --> 06:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense is a legal
 
06:37:44.708 --> 06:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
strategy that asks a jury to find that a
 
06:37:46.948 --> 06:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
victim's sexual orientation or gender
 
06:37:50.310 --> 06:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
identity expression is to blame for
 
06:37:52.788 --> 06:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
defendant's violent reaction including
 
06:37:54.910 --> 06:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
murder what we've seen around the
 
06:37:57.468 --> 06:37:57.478 align:start position:0%
country is that this discriminatory gay
 
06:38:00.670 --> 06:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
Panic defense is used successfully to
 
06:38:02.150 --> 06:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
excuse the murder of members of the
 
06:38:04.468 --> 06:38:04.478 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus Comm
 
06:38:07.388 --> 06:38:07.398 align:start position:0%
Community this is a bipartisan Bill to
 
06:38:09.070 --> 06:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that this type of Defense can
 
06:38:10.910 --> 06:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
never be used in New
 
06:38:13.548 --> 06:38:13.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let me begin with what this
 
06:38:16.310 --> 06:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
Panic defense means when a perpetrator
 
06:38:19.548 --> 06:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
uses an lb lgbtq plus Panic defense they
 
06:38:21.150 --> 06:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
are claiming that a victim's sexual
 
06:38:23.868 --> 06:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
orientation or gender identity not only
 
06:38:26.868 --> 06:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
explains but excuses a loss of
 
06:38:29.708 --> 06:38:29.718 align:start position:0%
self-control and the subsequent assault
 
06:38:31.548 --> 06:38:31.558 align:start position:0%
this is currently allowed under New
 
06:38:33.590 --> 06:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
06:38:36.230 --> 06:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
this bill HB 238 will ban the use of a
 
06:38:38.110 --> 06:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
panic defense on the basis of someone's
 
06:38:40.468 --> 06:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
gender identity actual or perceived
 
06:38:44.388 --> 06:38:44.398 align:start position:0%
gender gender expression or sexual
 
06:38:46.750 --> 06:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
orientation someone's mere existence as
 
06:38:49.910 --> 06:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
an lgbtq plus person does not constitute
 
06:38:53.788 --> 06:38:53.798 align:start position:0%
a reason or provocation to commit
 
06:38:55.670 --> 06:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
manslaughter the American Bar
 
06:38:57.750 --> 06:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
Association opposes the use of gay Panic
 
06:39:00.788 --> 06:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
defense and since 2013 has called for
 
06:39:03.750 --> 06:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
local local state and Federal
 
06:39:05.788 --> 06:39:05.798 align:start position:0%
legislatures to curtail the availability
 
06:39:07.150 --> 06:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
of this
 
06:39:09.670 --> 06:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
defense let me be clear this bill does
 
06:39:11.548 --> 06:39:11.558 align:start position:0%
not dismiss traditional self-defense
 
06:39:14.868 --> 06:39:14.878 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and does not deny existing due
 
06:39:18.590 --> 06:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
process defenses this means lgbtq plus
 
06:39:20.948 --> 06:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
people would not be immune from
 
06:39:23.948 --> 06:39:23.958 align:start position:0%
prosecution should they be accused of a
 
06:39:26.510 --> 06:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
crime if passed New Hampshire will join
 
06:39:29.030 --> 06:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
12 other states in Washington DC in
 
06:39:31.388 --> 06:39:31.398 align:start position:0%
Banning this type of defense and join
 
06:39:32.990 --> 06:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
eight other states who are considering
 
06:39:33.000 --> 06:39:33.990 align:start position:0%
eight other states who are considering
similar

06:39:33.990 --> 06:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
similar
 
06:39:37.110 --> 06:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
similar legislation this year including
 
06:39:39.030 --> 06:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
Virginia Which just passed this
 
06:39:40.548 --> 06:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
legislation is now going to the
 
06:39:43.430 --> 06:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
governor's desk for our state we would
 
06:39:46.110 --> 06:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
be proactive in protecting individual
 
06:39:47.868 --> 06:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
rights by barring this
 
06:39:50.628 --> 06:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
defense nationally one out of five hate
 
06:39:53.430 --> 06:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
crimes are committed against lgbtq plus
 
06:39:56.110 --> 06:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
people to put this in New Hampshire's
 
06:39:59.788 --> 06:39:59.798 align:start position:0%
context in our state 5% of granite
 
06:40:02.990 --> 06:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
Staters identify as lgbtq plus the
 
06:40:05.468 --> 06:40:05.478 align:start position:0%
equival equalent of 60,000 people this
 
06:40:06.910 --> 06:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
is not a small
 
06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
constituency our state values personal
 
06:40:11.510 --> 06:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
freedom and our state also ranks very
 
06:40:12.670 --> 06:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
high in
 
06:40:12.680 --> 06:40:14.590 align:start position:0%
high in
lgbtq

06:40:14.590 --> 06:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
lgbtq
 
06:40:16.868 --> 06:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
protections over the past year I have
 
06:40:18.670 --> 06:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
had multiple citizens from across New
 
06:40:21.350 --> 06:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ask me to sponsor this
 
06:40:23.270 --> 06:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
legislation some are members of the
 
06:40:26.590 --> 06:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus Community who fear this law
 
06:40:29.310 --> 06:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
would excuse their murder but mostly
 
06:40:30.830 --> 06:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
I've heard from people who have friends
 
06:40:33.388 --> 06:40:33.398 align:start position:0%
or family members who are gay and have
 
06:40:36.388 --> 06:40:36.398 align:start position:0%

other states and do not want to see the
 
06:40:41.670 --> 06:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
same happen here this legislation will
 
06:40:43.230 --> 06:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
be correcting an oversight that is
 
06:40:46.548 --> 06:40:46.558 align:start position:0%

if someone committed murder um in a kind
 
06:43:53.350 --> 06:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
of a against an lgbtq person they could
 
06:43:56.070 --> 06:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
say that they were acting in a moment of
 
06:43:58.948 --> 06:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
insanity brief Insanity because of that
 
06:44:01.788 --> 06:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
person's identity um and then they can
 
06:44:05.430 --> 06:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
use it as a p that that was a panic um
 
06:44:09.510 --> 06:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:19.388 --> 06:44:19.398 align:start position:0%

when such person causes the death of

another by failing to request medical
 
06:47:17.350 --> 06:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
assistance for another person under
 
06:47:19.468 --> 06:47:19.478 align:start position:0%
circumstances where the actor knew or
 
06:47:21.310 --> 06:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
should have known that such person was
 
06:47:24.150 --> 06:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
in need of medical assistance in our
 
06:47:26.948 --> 06:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
situation here on December 12th 2020 the
 
06:47:28.388 --> 06:47:28.398 align:start position:0%
light went out of our Lives when our
 
06:47:30.750 --> 06:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
daughter died of a suspected opioid
 
06:47:34.150 --> 06:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
overdose she was accomplished um
 
06:47:37.430 --> 06:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
awardwinning costomer um she was 29
 
06:47:39.110 --> 06:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
years old and she had accomplished so
 
06:47:40.990 --> 06:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
much in her life and was looking forward
 
06:47:44.548 --> 06:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
to um many new uh Adventures she was a
 
06:47:46.230 --> 06:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
volunteer for the White Mountain Steward
 
06:47:49.270 --> 06:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
Trail asso stewardship she was deeply
 
06:47:51.590 --> 06:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
loved by her family and friends her
 
06:47:53.750 --> 06:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
death has left a huge hole in our hearts
 
06:47:56.548 --> 06:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
early in October of 2020 she started
 
06:47:58.990 --> 06:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
dating a man who introduced to the
 
06:48:01.430 --> 06:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
opioids she was not an opioid user
 
06:48:03.510 --> 06:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
before meeting this man
 
06:48:05.830 --> 06:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
um it turns out that the man was a drug
 
06:48:07.830 --> 06:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
addict and a drug dealer and had already
 
06:48:10.388 --> 06:48:10.398 align:start position:0%
been arrested twice for drug possession
 
06:48:13.350 --> 06:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
including another case involving an
 
06:48:15.430 --> 06:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
overdose in the early morning hours of
 
06:48:17.230 --> 06:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
December 12th a daughter experienced an
 
06:48:19.708 --> 06:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
OP opioid overdose and the drug dealer
 
06:48:22.788 --> 06:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
boyfriend had been with her all evening
 
06:48:24.430 --> 06:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
and there was no way that he didn't know
 
06:48:26.990 --> 06:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
that she was overdosing she didn't have
 
06:48:30.590 --> 06:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
to die if only he had called 911 and
 
06:48:34.830 --> 06:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:36.910 --> 06:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
in fact he was in her bedroom with her
 
06:48:39.830 --> 06:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
the whole evening with her dead body for
 
06:48:41.948 --> 06:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
several hours and he did
 
06:48:43.750 --> 06:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in the morning when the
 
06:48:45.708 --> 06:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
boyfriend heard A daughter's roommate
 
06:48:48.590 --> 06:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
get up he um told him that something was
 
06:48:49.670 --> 06:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
wrong with
 
06:48:53.110 --> 06:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
her and they tried to do CPR but
 
06:48:54.830 --> 06:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
realized she was still wasn't breathing
 
06:48:56.310 --> 06:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
and her roommate went for
 
06:48:59.030 --> 06:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
help uh in the meantime the boyfriend
 
06:49:00.910 --> 06:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
ran away from the apartment and it
 
06:49:03.190 --> 06:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
appears he did this before in the last
 
06:49:06.190 --> 06:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
overdose he was involved in he ran
 
06:49:09.430 --> 06:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
away so we believe that he was running
 
06:49:11.750 --> 06:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
away out of fear of being arrested again
 
06:49:14.110 --> 06:49:14.120 align:start position:0%
but so a person who is present for any
 
06:49:16.628 --> 06:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
medical emergency has a duty to call for
 
06:49:19.990 --> 06:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
help at the very least to not do so is
 
06:49:23.070 --> 06:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
reckless and negligent inaction is the
 
06:49:25.350 --> 06:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
opposite of acting in good faith
 
06:49:27.030 --> 06:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
especially if the inaction results in
 
06:49:28.868 --> 06:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
the death of The Afflicted
 
06:49:31.670 --> 06:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
person if this man had sought help when
 
06:49:33.628 --> 06:49:33.638 align:start position:0%
it was obvious that our daughter was in
 
06:49:37.150 --> 06:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
trouble she might still be alive
 
06:49:39.510 --> 06:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
today this could also help in other
 
06:49:42.548 --> 06:49:42.558 align:start position:0%
medical emergencies in
 
06:49:44.868 --> 06:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
accidents our daughter is irreplaceable
 
06:49:46.350 --> 06:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
we cannot bring her back she will
 
06:49:48.350 --> 06:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
forever be missed by those that love her

here thank you for allowing me to speak
 
06:51:31.310 --> 06:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
today rep of HB 238 the lgbtq plus Panic
 
06:51:33.388 --> 06:51:33.398 align:start position:0%
defense straty
 
06:51:35.670 --> 06:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
stry is a legal strategy that asks the
 
06:51:37.230 --> 06:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
jury to find a victim's sexual
 
06:51:39.910 --> 06:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
orientation or gender identity SL
 
06:51:42.510 --> 06:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
expression is to blame for a defendant's
 
06:51:45.830 --> 06:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
violent reaction including murder it is
 
06:51:47.948 --> 06:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
not a freestanding defense to criminal
 
06:51:51.230 --> 06:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
liability but rather a legal tactic used
 
06:51:54.910 --> 06:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
to bolster other defenses a m recent
 
06:51:58.150 --> 06:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
defense of the use of this defense was
 
06:51:58.160 --> 06:52:00.070 align:start position:0%
defense of the use of this defense was
in

06:52:00.070 --> 06:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:52:02.548 --> 06:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
2015 Daniel Spencer was stabbed in
 
06:52:04.948 --> 06:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
murdered by his neighbor Robert Miller
 
06:52:04.958 --> 06:52:06.070 align:start position:0%
murdered by his neighbor Robert Miller
in

06:52:06.070 --> 06:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:52:09.510 --> 06:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
2015 Miller claimed that he rejected a
 
06:52:11.628 --> 06:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
sexual advance from Spencer and acted in
 
06:52:13.628 --> 06:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
self-defense when Spencer became
 
06:52:16.628 --> 06:52:16.638 align:start position:0%
agitated but physical evidence disproved
 
06:52:19.468 --> 06:52:19.478 align:start position:0%
his claim that he was never in danger
 
06:52:22.070 --> 06:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
Miller's conviction was mitigated for
 
06:52:25.110 --> 06:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
murder to criminally negligent
 
06:52:26.990 --> 06:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
manslaughter I will leave you with the
 
06:52:29.270 --> 06:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
following quote by honorable former US
 
06:52:31.350 --> 06:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
Representative Joe Kennedy III from
 
06:52:33.030 --> 06:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who said
 
06:52:35.388 --> 06:52:35.398 align:start position:0%
murdering or assaulting anyone because
 
06:52:37.310 --> 06:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
of their sexual orientation or gender
 
06:52:39.468 --> 06:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
identity is not a defense it is a hate
 
06:52:41.990 --> 06:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
crime one would hope that as time
 
06:52:43.628 --> 06:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
progresses we would have learned and
 
06:52:46.270 --> 06:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
done better for the victims but we have
 
06:52:49.350 --> 06:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
not and I hope that we joined the other
 
06:52:52.310 --> 06:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
11 states and change this law thank you
 
06:52:55.708 --> 06:52:55.718 align:start position:0%
and I will divert other questions to
 
06:53:00.590 --> 06:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:03.750 --> 06:53:03.760 align:start position:0%

06:53:07.070 --> 06:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
believe believe the representa does not
 
06:53:19.670 --> 06:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:25.310 --> 06:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:28.190 --> 06:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
toll honorable members of the criminal
 
06:53:30.310 --> 06:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
justice committee my name is Amanda
 
06:53:33.110 --> 06:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth tol I represent Chesire 16
 
06:53:34.868 --> 06:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
which encompasses the city of keen at
 
06:53:37.670 --> 06:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
large I'm here today in support of HB
 
06:53:40.388 --> 06:53:40.398 align:start position:0%
238 I think the vast majority of New
 
06:53:42.948 --> 06:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constituents regardless of
 
06:53:46.510 --> 06:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
political party support codifying lgbtq
 
06:53:48.670 --> 06:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
plus rights into law and making New
 
06:53:51.590 --> 06:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a welcoming State nearly every
 
06:53:53.388 --> 06:53:53.398 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire constituent knows and
 
06:53:54.990 --> 06:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
loves someone who is a member of the
 
06:53:58.270 --> 06:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus Community I cannot think of
 
06:53:59.910 --> 06:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
another instance in which a victim's
 
06:54:02.110 --> 06:54:02.120 align:start position:0%
identity can be used as a defense in a
 
06:54:04.868 --> 06:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
crime and so this is a long time coming
 
06:54:06.590 --> 06:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
our neighbors in Connecticut Rhode
 
06:54:08.388 --> 06:54:08.398 align:start position:0%
Island and Maine have passed similar
 
06:54:10.670 --> 06:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
legislation we want people in our state
 
06:54:13.110 --> 06:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
to feel safe and we take pride in being
 
06:54:15.510 --> 06:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
a state that values diversity this bill
 
06:54:17.230 --> 06:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
would be a crucial step forward in
 
06:54:19.830 --> 06:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
establishing legal safety for the lgbtq
 
06:54:21.750 --> 06:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
plus community and I urge you to support
 
06:54:24.270 --> 06:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
it I will be deferring questions thank

you for taking my testimony I'm speaking
 
06:54:42.590 --> 06:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
against House Bill
 
06:54:46.388 --> 06:54:46.398 align:start position:0%
238 um not sure it'll take a full minute
 
06:54:49.948 --> 06:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
um it the way it's written um doesn't
 
06:54:52.230 --> 06:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
quite match the the testimony that
 
06:54:54.750 --> 06:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's been given so far um it the bill
 
06:54:57.388 --> 06:54:57.398 align:start position:0%
as written appears to violate Article 15
 
06:54:59.030 --> 06:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is which states every subject
 
06:55:01.468 --> 06:55:01.478 align:start position:0%
shall have a right to produce all proofs
 
06:55:03.990 --> 06:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
that may be favorable to himself to meet
 
06:55:06.030 --> 06:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
the witnesses against him face to face
 
06:55:09.030 --> 06:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
and to be fully heard in his defense by
 
06:55:11.948 --> 06:55:11.958 align:start position:0%
himself and counsel frequently if you're
 
06:55:14.670 --> 06:55:14.680 align:start position:0%
charged with murder and you're um
 
06:55:17.030 --> 06:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
introducing a lesser included offense of
 
06:55:20.830 --> 06:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
manslaughter uh manslaughter is often
 
06:55:22.750 --> 06:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
admitting to all the elements except
 
06:55:25.270 --> 06:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
that you're saying um that you're you're
 
06:55:26.310 --> 06:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
06:55:28.548 --> 06:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
introduce uh the influence of extreme
 
06:55:30.388 --> 06:55:30.398 align:start position:0%
mental or emotional disturbance caused
 
06:55:32.948 --> 06:55:32.958 align:start position:0%
by extreme provocation
 
06:55:34.830 --> 06:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
and you have the right you have a due
 
06:55:36.510 --> 06:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
process right to introduce all evidence
 
06:55:38.270 --> 06:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
and all eyewitness testimony in support
 
06:55:40.468 --> 06:55:40.478 align:start position:0%
of that um this has nothing to do with
 
06:55:43.948 --> 06:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
protecting lgbtq plus people who um do
 
06:55:47.350 --> 06:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
deserve to be protected um an example
 
06:55:48.708 --> 06:55:48.718 align:start position:0%

06:58:09.708 --> 06:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
siblings on the porch and she said what
 
06:58:11.830 --> 06:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
if I told y'all I was gay and she was
 
06:58:14.430 --> 06:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
laughing about it and I said some words
 
06:58:16.468 --> 06:58:16.478 align:start position:0%
that I regret to this day and I was like
 
06:58:20.030 --> 06:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
Mom I'll dishone you and she fell out
 
06:58:22.788 --> 06:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
the chair crying and balled up on the
 
06:58:25.190 --> 06:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
porch and that was the day I found out
 
06:58:29.070 --> 06:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
that my mother was gay and and we cried
 
06:58:33.590 --> 06:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
with her and and I um I said to her uh a
 
06:58:35.510 --> 06:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
couple days later I said you know what
 
06:58:38.070 --> 06:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
Mom if a if a female makes you happier
 
06:58:39.948 --> 06:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
than a male then it makes me happy and
 
06:58:41.910 --> 06:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
the end you're my mommy and I'm going to
 
06:58:45.430 --> 06:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
love you forever you know and then I
 
06:58:47.830 --> 06:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
thought to myself I was 12 years old and
 
06:58:50.830 --> 06:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
I said you know I can't say I hate gays
 
06:58:53.110 --> 06:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
because I would never say I hate my mom
 
06:58:55.548 --> 06:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
so it brought in my mind to it and I
 
06:58:58.350 --> 06:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
actually start talking and open up to a
 
06:59:01.070 --> 06:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
lot of them especially in college you
 
06:59:04.070 --> 06:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
know and and I realized yo that people
 
06:59:07.430 --> 06:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
just like us you know um they are who
 
06:59:10.110 --> 06:59:10.120 align:start position:0%
they are and in the end we're all human
 
06:59:13.110 --> 06:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know and when I found out that
 
06:59:15.750 --> 06:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's a law that someone can just say
 
06:59:19.990 --> 06:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know oh because this uh they're gay
 
06:59:22.310 --> 06:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
and I I didn't know and this and they
 
06:59:25.190 --> 06:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
did this they can just uh do whatever
 
06:59:27.830 --> 06:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
they want or up to even kill me and get
 
06:59:30.070 --> 06:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
away with in the in the in the in the
 
06:59:34.468 --> 06:59:34.478 align:start position:0%
Court's eyes and I would I would never
 
06:59:37.708 --> 06:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
uh want to see any harm done to my mom
 
06:59:41.948 --> 06:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
because of the person she is and the way
 
06:59:44.468 --> 06:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
the the the way she chooses to live her
 
06:59:47.548 --> 06:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
life you know and um so I'm call I'm
 
06:59:49.708 --> 06:59:49.718 align:start position:0%

Manchester um I'm speaking today on
 
07:00:44.230 --> 07:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire High School
 
07:00:46.110 --> 07:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
Democrats and as a member of the LGBT
 
07:00:48.430 --> 07:00:48.440 align:start position:0%
community in support of HB
 
07:00:51.350 --> 07:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
238 I support HB 238 because it would
 
07:00:52.750 --> 07:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
prohibit the institutionalized
 
07:00:54.990 --> 07:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
recognition of hate and LGBT alienation
 
07:00:57.310 --> 07:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
in our state allowing the LGBT pan of
 
07:00:58.910 --> 07:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
Defense to continue to be used divides
 
07:01:00.788 --> 07:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
and stigmatizes the LGBT community and
 
07:01:01.788 --> 07:01:01.798 align:start position:0%
says that we are something to be afraid
 
07:01:01.798 --> 07:01:02.548 align:start position:0%
says that we are something to be afraid
of

07:01:02.548 --> 07:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:01:03.830 --> 07:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
and that violent action against us
 
07:01:05.468 --> 07:01:05.478 align:start position:0%
simply because of our identity is
 
07:01:07.310 --> 07:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
justifiable it's estimated that almost
 
07:01:08.948 --> 07:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
5% of our population in New Hampshire
 
07:01:10.868 --> 07:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
more than 64,000 people is part of the
 
07:01:13.270 --> 07:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
LGBT community this legislation would
 
07:01:15.110 --> 07:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
help make New Hampshire a safe space for
 
07:01:15.120 --> 07:01:15.788 align:start position:0%
help make New Hampshire a safe space for
those

07:01:15.788 --> 07:01:15.798 align:start position:0%
those
 
07:01:17.708 --> 07:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
64,000 New Hampshire should not be a
 
07:01:19.350 --> 07:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
state where LGBT people have to fear for
 
07:01:20.830 --> 07:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
our lives it should be a place where we
 
07:01:22.230 --> 07:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
welcome diversity and understand the
 
07:01:24.388 --> 07:01:24.398 align:start position:0%
value of every one of our citizens by
 
07:01:25.868 --> 07:01:25.878 align:start position:0%
taking this step We join other states in
 
07:01:27.430 --> 07:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
taking a stance on LGBT rights and
 
07:01:29.190 --> 07:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that we do what's necessary to
 
07:01:30.910 --> 07:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
protect our communities in order to
 
07:01:32.468 --> 07:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
promote equality and sure that we as a
 
07:01:34.388 --> 07:01:34.398 align:start position:0%
state do not recognize hate and to show
 
07:01:35.350 --> 07:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country that we are
 
07:01:36.990 --> 07:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
doing what is needed to protect LGBT
 
07:01:38.388 --> 07:01:38.398 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire I urge the
 
07:01:40.910 --> 07:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
committee to recommend opop pass on h238
 
07:01:45.070 --> 07:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:47.590 --> 07:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your
 
07:01:49.990 --> 07:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
testimony see no hands raised the
 
07:02:12.310 --> 07:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:12.320 --> 07:02:16.788 align:start position:0%
 
Jody

07:02:16.788 --> 07:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:19.590 --> 07:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
well hi um thank you for allowing me to
 
07:02:22.430 --> 07:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
speak um I'm going to be speaking um in
 
07:02:25.910 --> 07:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 603 um and first I just
 
07:02:28.230 --> 07:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
want to extend my sympathy to um Donna
 
07:02:30.070 --> 07:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
and Mr Waters the parents of um people
 
07:02:31.948 --> 07:02:31.958 align:start position:0%
they've lost your descriptions of your
 
07:02:33.708 --> 07:02:33.718 align:start position:0%
kids remind me so much of my Corey and
 
07:02:35.868 --> 07:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry for your loss the night
 
07:02:37.468 --> 07:02:37.478 align:start position:0%
before Corey passed I dropped him off at
 
07:02:39.430 --> 07:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
the program he was attending to get well
 
07:02:41.270 --> 07:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
later that night he recorded a van full
 
07:02:43.070 --> 07:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
of folks singing Under the Bridge I
 
07:02:44.468 --> 07:02:44.478 align:start position:0%
cherished that recording and I listened
 
07:02:46.030 --> 07:02:46.040 align:start position:0%
to it over and over and over until the
 
07:02:48.150 --> 07:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
phone finally died in my grief and
 
07:02:50.510 --> 07:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
distress I wanted an explanation I
 
07:02:52.948 --> 07:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
wanted resolution I wanted someone to
 
07:02:54.990 --> 07:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
blame and it occurred to me that the
 
07:02:56.388 --> 07:02:56.398 align:start position:0%
these were the voices of the last people
 
07:02:58.548 --> 07:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
he was with before he came home I became
 
07:03:00.230 --> 07:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
obsessed with finding out who gave him
 
07:03:02.270 --> 07:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
the heroin and eventually I found that
 
07:03:03.948 --> 07:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
but the thing is finding them didn't
 
07:03:05.788 --> 07:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
give me the piece I thought it would
 
07:03:08.070 --> 07:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
rather finding them gave me a face it
 
07:03:09.750 --> 07:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
was the face of a person I didn't know
 
07:03:11.788 --> 07:03:11.798 align:start position:0%
but a person all the same a human being
 
07:03:13.670 --> 07:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
who struggled much in the way Corey did
 
07:03:15.070 --> 07:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
meeting that person didn't make me want
 
07:03:18.270 --> 07:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
to kill them or have them rot in jail or
 
07:03:19.670 --> 07:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh for the rest of their lives instead
 
07:03:21.310 --> 07:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
of wanting to continue blaming them to
 
07:03:23.590 --> 07:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
report them to pursue some type of
 
07:03:25.230 --> 07:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
Retribution all it made me feel was
 
07:03:27.548 --> 07:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
empathy and sorrow I wanted to help them
 
07:03:29.230 --> 07:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
and I wish we had some better system to
 
07:03:30.708 --> 07:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
help them not a system that'd throw them
 
07:03:33.070 --> 07:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
in jail um rather than helping them
 
07:03:34.868 --> 07:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate in our quest to rid our
 
07:03:36.670 --> 07:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
community of a drug we've ostracized
 
07:03:38.150 --> 07:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
people we've vilified and maligned
 
07:03:40.310 --> 07:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
members of our community we've taken our
 
07:03:42.030 --> 07:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
community from them and I'm afraid we
 
07:03:43.388 --> 07:03:43.398 align:start position:0%
could be moving in much the wrong
 
07:03:45.670 --> 07:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
direction uh even more so this year this
 
07:03:47.310 --> 07:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
bill would give life in prison to anyone
 
07:03:49.110 --> 07:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
who sold or gave drugs to someone who
 
07:03:51.190 --> 07:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
dies of any overdose I think if anyone
 
07:03:52.468 --> 07:03:52.478 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would feel this is
 
07:03:54.070 --> 07:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
Justified it would be someone like me
 
07:03:56.788 --> 07:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
who's lost a loved one to uh overdose
 
07:03:58.628 --> 07:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
but having been through that I learned
 
07:03:59.910 --> 07:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
just the opposite I learned that
 
07:04:01.990 --> 07:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
criminalization is not the answer it
 
07:04:04.110 --> 07:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
only serves to peret perpetuate a
 
07:04:06.110 --> 07:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
punitive mentality that assigns malice
 
07:04:08.590 --> 07:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
to hurting people people Whose desire to
 
07:04:10.590 --> 07:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
relieve pain man manifests in this
 
07:04:12.350 --> 07:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
particular way so rather than double
 
07:04:14.150 --> 07:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
down on this failed strategy I humbly
 
07:04:15.868 --> 07:04:15.878 align:start position:0%
request that we seek out ways to support
 
07:04:18.830 --> 07:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
them rather than uh throw them in you
 
07:04:18.840 --> 07:04:20.868 align:start position:0%
them rather than uh throw them in you
thank

07:04:20.868 --> 07:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:04:23.230 --> 07:04:23.240 align:start position:0%

07:04:38.590 --> 07:04:38.600 align:start position:0%

J

07:04:41.948 --> 07:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:46.070 --> 07:04:46.080 align:start position:0%

07:04:57.990 --> 07:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
603 um we heard previous testimony and
 
07:05:00.708 --> 07:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
other bills about uh how police and
 
07:05:01.910 --> 07:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
other people in law enforcement would
 
07:05:03.350 --> 07:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
like to see more
 
07:05:05.788 --> 07:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um Treatment available
 
07:05:08.910 --> 07:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
for people uh to help battle the uh drug
 
07:05:10.990 --> 07:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
problem in the state but we never hear
 
07:05:12.868 --> 07:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
anybody say we want
 
07:05:16.070 --> 07:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um prosecution of
 
07:05:18.548 --> 07:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
enforcement and and law more laws on the
 
07:05:21.350 --> 07:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
books there is no evidence whatsoever to
 
07:05:23.750 --> 07:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
support a law like this helping to
 
07:05:26.868 --> 07:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
reduce overdoses deaths uh in any way
 
07:05:28.708 --> 07:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
whatsoever if anything it can actually
 
07:05:30.910 --> 07:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
deter people seeking life-saving
 
07:05:32.310 --> 07:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
treatment because because of fear of
 
07:05:35.270 --> 07:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
arrest we do have a law that allows for
 
07:05:37.150 --> 07:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
uh Good Samaritan law to allow for
 
07:05:38.868 --> 07:05:38.878 align:start position:0%
calling for help in an overdose but it
 
07:05:40.990 --> 07:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
would not prevent someone from uh
 
07:05:43.190 --> 07:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
calling in an instance like this they'd
 
07:05:44.830 --> 07:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
be less likely to call for help and more
 
07:05:47.590 --> 07:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
people will die uh another really bad
 
07:05:49.868 --> 07:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
part of this uh is section c
 
07:05:52.030 --> 07:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
specifically where it says uh directly
 
07:05:53.628 --> 07:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
or indirectly related to the sale
 
07:05:55.430 --> 07:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
transfer injection or
 
07:05:58.310 --> 07:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
ingestion um you know that doesn't that
 
07:05:59.910 --> 07:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
goes way further than the homicide
 
07:06:01.670 --> 07:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
section where it has to do with the sale
 
07:06:03.150 --> 07:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
the drug this has to do with anything
 
07:06:04.628 --> 07:06:04.638 align:start position:0%
this could be giving someone a ride
 
07:06:06.430 --> 07:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
there this could be someone involved in
 
07:06:08.430 --> 07:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
a syin service program providing a clean
 
07:06:10.030 --> 07:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
needle so someone doesn't get Hepatitis
 
07:06:12.110 --> 07:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
or Aids and if they are giving someone
 
07:06:14.110 --> 07:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
the means to safely inject they could
 
07:06:16.310 --> 07:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
technically be indirectly related uh
 
07:06:19.910 --> 07:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
liable for um their death and that is
 
07:06:23.070 --> 07:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
ridiculous uh as far as the I I can talk
 
07:06:24.788 --> 07:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
about defense of a person in the stand
 
07:06:27.910 --> 07:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
your ground section if people have
 
07:06:30.948 --> 07:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
questions do Dr Hannah we do have to
 
07:06:34.388 --> 07:06:34.398 align:start position:0%
limit test to one minute and additional
 
07:06:38.468 --> 07:06:38.478 align:start position:0%
NE you Clos to two minutes I apologize
 
07:06:42.670 --> 07:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
um if we do have to suspend suspend your
 
07:06:44.708 --> 07:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
testimony but members are free to ask
 
07:06:46.030 --> 07:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Marston you
 
07:06:48.628 --> 07:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chairman and
 
07:06:51.910 --> 07:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you former representative Joe
 
07:06:55.310 --> 07:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hanson uh I worked on that bill that you
 
07:06:58.350 --> 07:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
just reference to about if somebody has
 
07:07:01.190 --> 07:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
had a reaction to a drug and is in
 
07:07:01.200 --> 07:07:02.190 align:start position:0%
had a reaction to a drug and is in
trouble

07:07:02.190 --> 07:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
trouble
 
07:07:05.270 --> 07:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
and they call 911 no arrest can result
 
07:07:08.388 --> 07:07:08.398 align:start position:0%
from that and I worked on that and got
 
07:07:10.990 --> 07:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
that passed do you recall the RSA number
 
07:07:12.388 --> 07:07:12.398 align:start position:0%
that that now
 
07:07:17.510 --> 07:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:21.388 --> 07:07:21.398 align:start position:0%
6268 uh if you look at section four uh
 
07:07:23.910 --> 07:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know if an accomplice in conduct uh
 
07:07:26.030 --> 07:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh no I'm I'm very sorry I
 
07:07:30.030 --> 07:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
apologize that is um I'm sorry section
 
07:07:32.830 --> 07:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
it's 318b
 
07:07:35.750 --> 07:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
28b and uh if a person in good faith
 
07:07:37.230 --> 07:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
calls the you know for medical
 
07:07:39.468 --> 07:07:39.478 align:start position:0%
assistance for an overdose uh in a
 
07:07:41.548 --> 07:07:41.558 align:start position:0%
timely manner doesn't have a 12-hour
 
07:07:42.548 --> 07:07:42.558 align:start position:0%
requirement or anything like that it
 
07:07:43.948 --> 07:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
says they shall not be arrested
 
07:07:45.830 --> 07:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
prosecuted or convicted for possessing
 
07:07:47.270 --> 07:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
or having under his or her control a
 
07:07:50.670 --> 07:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
control drug and violation RSA 318 B2 if
 
07:07:52.110 --> 07:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
the evidence for the charge was gained
 
07:07:53.548 --> 07:07:53.558 align:start position:0%
an approximate result for the Quest for
 
07:07:55.388 --> 07:07:55.398 align:start position:0%
medical assistance that doesn't mean
 
07:07:56.628 --> 07:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
that someone can't be arrested for
 
07:07:58.230 --> 07:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
outstanding warrants they can be
 
07:08:00.868 --> 07:08:00.878 align:start position:0%
arrested for uh self-defense they could
 
07:08:03.110 --> 07:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
be arrested for trying to defend
 
07:08:05.548 --> 07:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
themselves say a drug dealer is asking
 
07:08:07.788 --> 07:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
someone for you know forcing themselves
 
07:08:11.350 --> 07:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
sexually they could be um found liable
 
07:08:12.990 --> 07:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
they they could not be according to this
 
07:08:14.548 --> 07:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
bill they wouldn't be allowed to defend
 
07:08:17.468 --> 07:08:17.478 align:start position:0%
themselves against uh rape or another
 
07:08:20.468 --> 07:08:20.478 align:start position:0%
deadly or but life serious bodily injury
 
07:08:22.110 --> 07:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
because they were involved in the deal
 
07:08:23.430 --> 07:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't just pertain to drug
 
07:08:25.230 --> 07:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
dealers this pertains to anybody
 
07:08:28.110 --> 07:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
involved in using or injecting or in any
 
07:08:29.788 --> 07:08:29.798 align:start position:0%
way this could be the driver who drove
 
07:08:32.548 --> 07:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
you to the drug dealer's house um you're
 
07:08:34.750 --> 07:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
not protected so it's a very dangerous
 
07:08:36.510 --> 07:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
precedent for stand your ground and I
 
07:08:39.830 --> 07:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
think it is uh it is there's two very
 
07:08:41.548 --> 07:08:41.558 align:start position:0%
major issues with this bill that are
 
07:08:44.270 --> 07:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
that are more than concerning and I
 
07:08:45.948 --> 07:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
think uh I I do thank you for helping
 
07:08:48.070 --> 07:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
with that other bill it has saved lives
 
07:08:50.628 --> 07:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
in my mind I believe it has but we want
 
07:08:52.310 --> 07:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
evidence-based practices and we have not
 
07:08:54.030 --> 07:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
heard one bit of evidence that any of
 
07:08:55.590 --> 07:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
these kind of laws help in any way
 
07:08:57.110 --> 07:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and I've been listening all
 
07:08:59.910 --> 07:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon I've not heard one
 
07:09:02.430 --> 07:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
thing thank you representative Bourne
 
07:09:02.440 --> 07:09:03.350 align:start position:0%
thing thank you representative Bourne
you

07:09:03.350 --> 07:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:09:06.350 --> 07:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chairman thank
 
07:09:08.628 --> 07:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
07:09:08.638 --> 07:09:10.948 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
question

07:09:10.948 --> 07:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:09:15.070 --> 07:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
um Jo do you know what happens if a
 
07:09:19.310 --> 07:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
bartender sells a customer alcohol and
 
07:09:21.350 --> 07:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
they go outside the bar and have a
 
07:09:23.910 --> 07:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
accident on which they someone dies in
 
07:09:27.270 --> 07:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
an accident is the bartender uh accused
 
07:09:30.868 --> 07:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
of manslaughter uh as a general rule no
 
07:09:33.548 --> 07:09:33.558 align:start position:0%
but they can be they can be charged or
 
07:09:36.310 --> 07:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
sued uh if they were knowingly serving
 
07:09:38.190 --> 07:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
someone who was excessively intoxicated
 
07:09:39.468 --> 07:09:39.478 align:start position:0%
and they didn't prevent them from
 
07:09:40.910 --> 07:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
getting into a vehicle I believe I don't
 
07:09:43.310 --> 07:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
know the specifics of how that works but
 
07:09:45.110 --> 07:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
I I know that it has happened I know of
 
07:09:47.350 --> 07:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
a few bar owners that have been charged
 
07:09:50.430 --> 07:09:50.440 align:start position:0%
or sued because of uh that but as a
 
07:09:53.868 --> 07:09:53.878 align:start position:0%
general rule no unless there's something
 
07:09:56.350 --> 07:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
you know they're if you're forcing a
 
07:09:57.670 --> 07:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
beer down someone's throat and then
 
07:09:59.190 --> 07:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
giving them their car keys obviously
 
07:10:00.868 --> 07:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
it's a slam dunk but if you're just
 
07:10:02.510 --> 07:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
serving a a beer and someone you don't
 
07:10:05.230 --> 07:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
know they're inated that is generally
 
07:10:06.990 --> 07:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
not what happens to
 
07:10:11.990 --> 07:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:14.230 --> 07:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
you seeing No Hands raised I want to
 
07:10:16.230 --> 07:10:16.240 align:start position:0%

are in attendance uh if you are in
 
07:10:31.948 --> 07:10:31.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:40.468 --> 07:10:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:42.468 --> 07:10:42.478 align:start position:0%
Ebert good afternoon members of the
 
07:10:45.708 --> 07:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Joe Ebert it's ebrt
 
07:10:47.110 --> 07:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a captain with the New Hampshire
 
07:10:48.708 --> 07:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
State Police I oversee our Investigative
 
07:10:51.468 --> 07:10:51.478 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau I want to start by
 
07:10:54.070 --> 07:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
saying um I I truly feel for the
 
07:10:56.548 --> 07:10:56.558 align:start position:0%
families who've testified here today uh
 
07:10:58.310 --> 07:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I have great respect for retired
 
07:11:01.548 --> 07:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
detective Art Williams um I I do have
 
07:11:04.430 --> 07:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
some questions uh within the bill and
 
07:11:07.708 --> 07:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
representative B's uh previous question
 
07:11:10.868 --> 07:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
gets to some of where uh my concerns
 
07:11:13.910 --> 07:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
come in the uh the line within the bill
 
07:11:17.388 --> 07:11:17.398 align:start position:0%
that speaks about or any conduct of
 
07:11:20.750 --> 07:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
another I I wonder if uh the bill were
 
07:11:23.030 --> 07:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
to uh proceed forward out of this
 
07:11:25.070 --> 07:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
committee if the committee would
 
07:11:27.628 --> 07:11:27.638 align:start position:0%
consider some type of guardrail uh
 
07:11:29.948 --> 07:11:29.958 align:start position:0%
around what conduct could or could not
 
07:11:31.990 --> 07:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
be attributed
 
07:11:35.670 --> 07:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh to the sale of a drug um so that's
 
07:11:37.990 --> 07:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the first thing uh the second as it
 
07:11:41.548 --> 07:11:41.558 align:start position:0%
relates to um the homicide case that was
 
07:11:43.350 --> 07:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
discussed although I don't know the the
 
07:11:46.468 --> 07:11:46.478 align:start position:0%
details of that um I understand the
 
07:11:48.070 --> 07:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
07:11:51.110 --> 07:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
to is to take away a defense of a drug
 
07:11:53.190 --> 07:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
dealer but as somebody who worked uh
 
07:11:56.628 --> 07:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
homicides for a number of years what I
 
07:11:58.350 --> 07:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that we have to
 
07:12:01.628 --> 07:12:01.638 align:start position:0%
independently uh look at self-defense in
 
07:12:03.708 --> 07:12:03.718 align:start position:0%
in many cases in which people put
 
07:12:06.750 --> 07:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
themselves in those uh scenarios so I I
 
07:12:09.310 --> 07:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
offer that to you that does not make um
 
07:12:11.110 --> 07:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
the loss of the life that took place
 
07:12:13.510 --> 07:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
there any any less and I don't want that
 
07:12:15.670 --> 07:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
to come across that way but I I would
 
07:12:18.548 --> 07:12:18.558 align:start position:0%
suggest to you that unfortunately um
 
07:12:20.430 --> 07:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
that is that that is the rule of law we
 
07:12:24.708 --> 07:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
look at self-defense uh uh regardless of
 
07:12:27.350 --> 07:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
how a person became in in a given
 
07:12:29.868 --> 07:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
situation U so having said those things
 
07:12:31.548 --> 07:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
and and expressed my concern I'm more
 
07:12:32.990 --> 07:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
than willing to answer any questions
 
07:12:38.708 --> 07:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:41.830 --> 07:12:41.840 align:start position:0%

07:13:47.990 --> 07:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty um my name is just mlan and
 
07:13:49.670 --> 07:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking as a resident of Cl New
 
07:13:51.590 --> 07:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a member of the
 
07:13:54.270 --> 07:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
public um there seems to be a disconnect
 
07:13:56.548 --> 07:13:56.558 align:start position:0%
in the protections for to the lgbtqa
 
07:13:58.750 --> 07:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
community and testimony voiced in
 
07:14:00.548 --> 07:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill I fail to see
 
07:14:02.270 --> 07:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
how an instill fear of someone's sexual
 
07:14:04.708 --> 07:14:04.718 align:start position:0%
orientation or identification has any
 
07:14:07.270 --> 07:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
business in justifying assault murder of
 
07:14:09.628 --> 07:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
any individual or group including the
 
07:14:12.070 --> 07:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
LGBT community we preached that New
 
07:14:14.468 --> 07:14:14.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is safe in a nonpartisan form
 
07:14:15.670 --> 07:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
and this is just one of a number of
 
07:14:17.350 --> 07:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
bills that is working to remedy past
 
07:14:19.430 --> 07:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
transgressions and providing legislative
 
07:14:21.590 --> 07:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
safety for every individual regardless
 
07:14:23.868 --> 07:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
of characteristics my mother should not
 
07:14:25.590 --> 07:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
have to worry about her son dying
 
07:14:27.948 --> 07:14:27.958 align:start position:0%
because someone fears fiend fear what
 
07:14:29.670 --> 07:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
would you do if this was your family
 
07:14:31.430 --> 07:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
what if this protection was dressing
 
07:14:33.270 --> 07:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
Christianity or Caucasian would you be
 
07:14:33.280 --> 07:14:44.788 align:start position:0%

national LGBT Bar Association and and
 
07:15:22.150 --> 07:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here to convey our strong support of
 
07:15:25.468 --> 07:15:25.478 align:start position:0%
HB 238 uh this is an issue the LGB bar
 
07:15:27.548 --> 07:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
has been working on for over a decade
 
07:15:28.910 --> 07:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
some may wonder why this bill is
 
07:15:31.150 --> 07:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
necessary today unfortunately panic
 
07:15:33.150 --> 07:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
defenses are not a relic of the past
 
07:15:34.990 --> 07:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the country judges allow the
 
07:15:37.110 --> 07:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
defense to be raised prosecutors fail to
 
07:15:39.110 --> 07:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
object and biased juries refuse to
 
07:15:41.590 --> 07:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
impose a just punishment and murders
 
07:15:43.868 --> 07:15:43.878 align:start position:0%
escape the punishment they deserve I'd
 
07:15:45.110 --> 07:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
like to address a few questions that
 
07:15:46.670 --> 07:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
have been raised by the committee uh
 
07:15:48.468 --> 07:15:48.478 align:start position:0%
first in response to representative
 
07:15:50.750 --> 07:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
testerman's question uh because there is
 
07:15:53.070 --> 07:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
no systematic way of tracking criminal
 
07:15:55.110 --> 07:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
cases we do not have a clear picture of
 
07:15:56.708 --> 07:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
just how many times the defense has been
 
07:15:59.350 --> 07:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
used across the country uh the FBI does
 
07:16:01.270 --> 07:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
not even systematically track the
 
07:16:04.030 --> 07:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
murders of lgbtq plus victims and trial
 
07:16:05.590 --> 07:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
court proceedings in criminal matters
 
07:16:09.750 --> 07:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
are rarely published uh what we do know
 
07:16:11.708 --> 07:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
is that uh we have found hundreds of
 
07:16:13.788 --> 07:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
cases uh throughout the
 
07:16:17.788 --> 07:16:17.798 align:start position:0%
country mainly from a result of press um
 
07:16:21.910 --> 07:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
accounts of them um we also uh would
 
07:16:24.430 --> 07:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
note that there are no no due process
 
07:16:26.990 --> 07:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding uh this bill this
 
07:16:30.070 --> 07:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill does allow the um allowance of
 
07:16:32.990 --> 07:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
evidence uh and several Scholars have
 
07:16:35.150 --> 07:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
looked at uh whether there are due
 
07:16:37.670 --> 07:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
process concerns raised and uh all have
 
07:16:42.030 --> 07:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
resulted um that the Montana V Eagle
 
07:16:45.270 --> 07:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
Hoff Supreme Court case uh is consistent
 
07:16:49.548 --> 07:16:49.558 align:start position:0%
with the U Banning of the lgbtq panic
 
07:16:53.230 --> 07:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
defense um finally I would just say uh
 
07:16:55.708 --> 07:16:55.718 align:start position:0%
we urge these enactment of this
 
07:16:57.388 --> 07:16:57.398 align:start position:0%
important legislation that will prevent
 
07:16:58.910 --> 07:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
violent criminals from escaping the
 
07:17:00.910 --> 07:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
punishment they deserve and will make
 
07:17:02.708 --> 07:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
Equal justice under the law a living
 
07:17:05.150 --> 07:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
breathing reality for victims of
 
07:17:07.868 --> 07:17:07.878 align:start position:0%
violence thank
 
07:17:10.230 --> 07:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
you representative B you're recognized
 
07:17:13.270 --> 07:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair thank
 
07:17:16.110 --> 07:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question are you aware
 
07:17:20.590 --> 07:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
that this uh uh Bill only pertains to
 
07:17:23.708 --> 07:17:23.718 align:start position:0%
manslaughter should it not also uh
 
07:17:26.990 --> 07:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:17:29.990 --> 07:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
homicide uh thank you representative um
 
07:17:34.070 --> 07:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
so what this bill um does is that it
 
07:17:34.080 --> 07:17:35.548 align:start position:0%
so what this bill um does is that it
would

07:17:35.548 --> 07:17:35.558 align:start position:0%
would
 
07:17:41.388 --> 07:17:41.398 align:start position:0%
um you know would prevent the use of the
 
07:17:44.230 --> 07:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
provocation defense
 
07:17:49.910 --> 07:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
um as a as a um defense in in
 
07:17:52.350 --> 07:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
manslaughter to bring down a defense in
 
07:17:54.510 --> 07:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
the manslaughter cases uh is my
 
07:17:56.990 --> 07:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of of how how the bill uh
 
07:18:01.388 --> 07:18:01.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:04.948 --> 07:18:04.958 align:start position:0%
so to reduce a sentence of of Murder in
 
07:18:10.548 --> 07:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:12.750 --> 07:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
manslaughter I guess that's not how I'm
 
07:18:15.110 --> 07:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it but uh that's what you
 
07:18:22.628 --> 07:18:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:18:25.510 --> 07:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
you representative true thank you Mr
 
07:18:27.030 --> 07:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
07:18:30.830 --> 07:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
sir um so this bill would this bill
 
07:18:33.510 --> 07:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
proposes that a particular line of
 
07:18:36.750 --> 07:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
defense would not be allowed can you
 
07:18:38.110 --> 07:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
give us some other
 
07:18:41.350 --> 07:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
examples of lines of defense that and
 
07:18:43.350 --> 07:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
other cases that aren
 
07:18:45.750 --> 07:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
allowed sure happy to do that thank you
 
07:18:48.548 --> 07:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
representative um so so this is not
 
07:18:50.468 --> 07:18:50.478 align:start position:0%
saying that the the the defense is not
 
07:18:52.990 --> 07:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
allowed what it is saying is that um the
 
07:18:55.430 --> 07:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
use of a person sexual orientation or
 
07:18:57.230 --> 07:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
gender identity as the reason for the
 
07:19:00.750 --> 07:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
defense is not objectively reasonable um
 
07:19:03.230 --> 07:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other cases um
 
07:19:07.910 --> 07:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
where we see um this arise uh where we
 
07:19:12.150 --> 07:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
either limit evidence um or say that a
 
07:19:15.230 --> 07:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
um a defense is not permissible um for
 
07:19:18.150 --> 07:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
instance intoxication uh generally is
 
07:19:20.670 --> 07:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
not a defense and crime uh We've also
 
07:19:22.948 --> 07:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
have rape shield laws uh that limit
 
07:19:26.708 --> 07:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
testimony about a um rape victims uh
 
07:19:31.190 --> 07:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
sexual history um and there are
 
07:19:35.030 --> 07:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
other laws uh in other states that cabin
 
07:19:37.468 --> 07:19:37.478 align:start position:0%
uh the use of defenses uh for instance
 
07:19:40.190 --> 07:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
at least 15 states require a duty to
 
07:19:43.310 --> 07:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
retreat uh in order for a self-defense
 
07:19:47.190 --> 07:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
justification uh as well so so it is um
 
07:19:49.750 --> 07:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
a number of other states have certainly
 
07:19:52.750 --> 07:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
limited or cabined the defense uh
 
07:19:54.350 --> 07:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
including in other heat of passion
 
07:19:56.430 --> 07:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
defenses such as adultery uh where a
 
07:19:59.388 --> 07:19:59.398 align:start position:0%
number of jurisdictions have eliminated
 
07:20:02.110 --> 07:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh adultery as uh a reasonable
 
07:20:06.628 --> 07:20:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:10.910 --> 07:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:14.350 --> 07:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
you representative testman thank you Mr
 
07:20:15.830 --> 07:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
07:20:19.548 --> 07:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
question I assume you're uh licensed to
 
07:20:22.030 --> 07:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
practice in New Hampshire so I'll ask
 
07:20:24.350 --> 07:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
you a question that that was the other
 
07:20:26.948 --> 07:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
part of the question I asked before was
 
07:20:30.070 --> 07:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
how many cases are there like this in
 
07:20:34.310 --> 07:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the last 10 years sure
 
07:20:36.030 --> 07:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I am not
 
07:20:39.350 --> 07:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
licensed um to to practice uh in New
 
07:20:42.910 --> 07:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I don't have that that
 
07:20:45.430 --> 07:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
information in front of me I I you know
 
07:20:48.750 --> 07:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
again point out that that we do um have
 
07:20:50.788 --> 07:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
cases from across the country uh
 
07:20:54.270 --> 07:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
recently uh in Virginia uh where we last
 
07:20:58.670 --> 07:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
worked on this uh we found um eight or
 
07:21:01.230 --> 07:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
nine cases uh there
 
07:21:04.388 --> 07:21:04.398 align:start position:0%
um it requires a lot of digging because
 
07:21:07.990 --> 07:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
there is no uh way to find these cases
 
07:21:09.868 --> 07:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
other than through press accounts or
 
07:21:13.310 --> 07:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to each of your uh Superior Courts
 
07:21:15.708 --> 07:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
uh and and going through each of the
 
07:21:18.910 --> 07:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
criminal proceedings um to determine
 
07:21:20.948 --> 07:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
because these cases are not published uh
 
07:21:22.990 --> 07:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
criminal cases uh at the tri court level
 
07:21:24.750 --> 07:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
generally are not published uh and so
 
07:21:27.388 --> 07:21:27.398 align:start position:0%
there's no comprehensive way to to
 
07:21:27.398 --> 07:21:28.628 align:start position:0%
there's no comprehensive way to to
research

07:21:28.628 --> 07:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
research
 
07:21:34.388 --> 07:21:34.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:36.628 --> 07:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
representative Colley thank you Mr
 
07:21:38.990 --> 07:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you um sir for taking
 
07:21:42.990 --> 07:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
the question do you provide in as
 
07:21:45.948 --> 07:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
briefly as possible a rundown of the
 
07:21:48.430 --> 07:21:48.440 align:start position:0%
strategy behind using this defense is it
 
07:21:52.670 --> 07:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
to get the actor off you know have the
 
07:21:56.388 --> 07:21:56.398 align:start position:0%
charges dismissed is it to instill doubt
 
07:21:59.868 --> 07:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
how is this used uh by defendants across
 
07:22:02.468 --> 07:22:02.478 align:start position:0%
the country
 
07:22:05.430 --> 07:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
sure so we typically see this um in
 
07:22:07.190 --> 07:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
three ways uh one of which here is
 
07:22:10.708 --> 07:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
addressed um by the bill um so it it is
 
07:22:14.628 --> 07:22:14.638 align:start position:0%
typically used in a um a claim of
 
07:22:17.270 --> 07:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
self-defense uh or a claim of diminished
 
07:22:20.030 --> 07:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
capacity or as uh the case this bill
 
07:22:23.708 --> 07:22:23.718 align:start position:0%
addresses in the case of provocation um
 
07:22:26.150 --> 07:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh factually how this typically happens
 
07:22:28.548 --> 07:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh is that an
 
07:22:32.750 --> 07:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
individual um discover s that uh someone
 
07:22:36.110 --> 07:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
who um they are with uh makes a pass at
 
07:22:39.430 --> 07:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
them uh and and in that moment discovers
 
07:22:43.190 --> 07:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
that they are lgbtq plus uh and reacts
 
07:22:45.430 --> 07:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
violently to that uh that is what we've
 
07:22:48.548 --> 07:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
seen in cases the other uh type of case
 
07:22:52.430 --> 07:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
that we primarily see this in is where a
 
07:22:55.990 --> 07:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh man makes a pass at a transgender
 
07:22:59.230 --> 07:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
woman uh and does not realize uh her
 
07:23:02.990 --> 07:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
transgender status uh and when he does
 
07:23:05.230 --> 07:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh reacts uh
 
07:23:11.788 --> 07:23:11.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:19.948 --> 07:23:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:22.590 --> 07:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
you the chair would inquire of a
 
07:23:23.868 --> 07:23:23.878 align:start position:0%
question and I want to thank you in
 
07:23:27.270 --> 07:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
advance for taking my question uh is
 
07:23:29.308 --> 07:23:29.318 align:start position:0%
there any specific case that you could
 
07:23:30.990 --> 07:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
reference uh
 
07:23:33.190 --> 07:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
for this committee to refer to where
 
07:23:34.670 --> 07:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
this I look at this as more of a
 
07:23:36.628 --> 07:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
mitigation defense well this mitigation
 
07:23:38.388 --> 07:23:38.398 align:start position:0%
defense was actually successfully used
 
07:23:40.430 --> 07:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
in a in a trial
 
07:23:44.388 --> 07:23:44.398 align:start position:0%
setting yes it has been um successfully
 
07:23:44.398 --> 07:23:46.670 align:start position:0%
setting yes it has been um successfully
used

07:23:46.670 --> 07:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
used
 
07:23:49.590 --> 07:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
um uh and you are correct that it is uh
 
07:23:53.388 --> 07:23:53.398 align:start position:0%
typically a uh a mitigation defense um
 
07:23:56.548 --> 07:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
there was a case in Texas um that uh a
 
07:23:58.910 --> 07:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
murder that occurred in in 2015 I think
 
07:24:01.990 --> 07:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
the the trial occurred in 201 18 uh
 
07:24:06.708 --> 07:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
where a um the defendant uh stabbed and
 
07:24:09.868 --> 07:24:09.878 align:start position:0%
and murdered uh his
 
07:24:11.990 --> 07:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
neighbor uh claiming that he was
 
07:24:15.150 --> 07:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
rejecting a sexual Advance uh and acted
 
07:24:16.430 --> 07:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
in in
 
07:24:19.270 --> 07:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
self-defense um despite the fact that
 
07:24:21.868 --> 07:24:21.878 align:start position:0%
the physical evidence uh disproved uh
 
07:24:25.270 --> 07:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
this claim uh this um defendants
 
07:24:27.830 --> 07:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
conviction was mitigated uh from murder
 
07:24:31.670 --> 07:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
to criminally negligent manslaughter
 
07:24:35.910 --> 07:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh the other the other um most familiar
 
07:24:38.150 --> 07:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
case that that people may have may know
 
07:24:41.230 --> 07:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
of is where it was attempted to be used
 
07:24:43.548 --> 07:24:43.558 align:start position:0%
but not used successfully uh was in the
 
07:24:49.430 --> 07:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:53.150 --> 07:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
Wyoming thank you for taking my
 
07:24:56.070 --> 07:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
question see no further hands raised I
 
07:24:58.190 --> 07:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
want to thank the witness for his test
 
07:24:59.750 --> 07:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me representative Conley thank
 
07:25:01.190 --> 07:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
you this is more question the chair and
 
07:25:02.670 --> 07:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
this is in line with your question
 
07:25:03.830 --> 07:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm
 
07:25:06.270 --> 07:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
legitimately hoping to get better
 
07:25:09.388 --> 07:25:09.398 align:start position:0%
understand it does one in New Hampshire
 
07:25:13.030 --> 07:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
need to demonstrate uh that the defense
 
07:25:15.308 --> 07:25:15.318 align:start position:0%
that they're that they're using is
 
07:25:17.468 --> 07:25:17.478 align:start position:0%
Justified like can I just make up any
 
07:25:21.308 --> 07:25:21.318 align:start position:0%
excuse I want um including one like this
 
07:25:23.628 --> 07:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
one in hopes that it might get me a
 
07:25:26.308 --> 07:25:26.318 align:start position:0%
reduced sentence or R
 
07:25:29.190 --> 07:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
charge well is that for me the witness
 
07:25:30.990 --> 07:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
well I guess so the witness
 
07:25:33.670 --> 07:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
I try to tackle that
 
07:25:37.830 --> 07:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
first thank you representative um so
 
07:25:40.510 --> 07:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
what what I would say is that um the
 
07:25:43.628 --> 07:25:43.638 align:start position:0%
reason that the defense is necessary is
 
07:25:47.990 --> 07:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
is based on um digma and Prejudice uh
 
07:25:50.990 --> 07:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
that uh judges and juries uh continue to
 
07:25:54.548 --> 07:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
have um so you know certainly in in
 
07:25:59.190 --> 07:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
other ways a defendant can raise a a um
 
07:26:01.628 --> 07:26:01.638 align:start position:0%
theory of provocation
 
07:26:03.868 --> 07:26:03.878 align:start position:0%
uh based on on whatever they like um
 
07:26:05.750 --> 07:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
that the person was wearing you know the
 
07:26:09.548 --> 07:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
color red and and that uh created a um
 
07:26:12.388 --> 07:26:12.398 align:start position:0%
violent reaction in them um and it's up
 
07:26:14.270 --> 07:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
for the try or fact in this case the
 
07:26:15.670 --> 07:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
jury to determine whether that's
 
07:26:19.190 --> 07:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not um the problem here is
 
07:26:22.430 --> 07:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
that even with the advances that we've
 
07:26:27.270 --> 07:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
seen uh with lgbtq equality um this the
 
07:26:29.510 --> 07:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
type of evidence that's being uh
 
07:26:32.548 --> 07:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
presented uh sways the emotions of the
 
07:26:34.548 --> 07:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
juries and feeds on their pre-existing
 
07:26:44.110 --> 07:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:45.990 --> 07:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
successful I the chair would just
 
07:26:48.708 --> 07:26:48.718 align:start position:0%
inquire of a question you gave me a name
 
07:26:49.948 --> 07:26:49.958 align:start position:0%

07:28:38.750 --> 07:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
her husband but clearly one doesn't
 
07:28:39.948 --> 07:28:39.958 align:start position:0%
understand that punishment would not
 
07:28:42.070 --> 07:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
have stopped her son's death while the
 
07:28:43.548 --> 07:28:43.558 align:start position:0%
other had to go on a journey of
 
07:28:45.628 --> 07:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
realizing punishment isn't going to end
 
07:28:48.230 --> 07:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
drug use or the sale of drugs uh the
 
07:28:50.270 --> 07:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
mother who spoke about her son Mike it's
 
07:28:52.708 --> 07:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
very sad and unfortunate death um just
 
07:28:54.910 --> 07:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
fails to realize that her son if he
 
07:28:56.830 --> 07:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
lived he would have been arrested by the
 
07:28:59.110 --> 07:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
same laws that she's promoting and yet
 
07:29:01.468 --> 07:29:01.478 align:start position:0%
is asking exact that to happen of other
 
07:29:04.468 --> 07:29:04.478 align:start position:0%
sons and and daughters so I also I'm
 
07:29:07.590 --> 07:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of h238 because it
 
07:29:09.868 --> 07:29:09.878 align:start position:0%
gives people more protections to ensure
 
07:29:12.308 --> 07:29:12.318 align:start position:0%
that people who are trans and nonbinary
 
07:29:14.830 --> 07:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
in our state are not targeted by people
 
07:29:17.990 --> 07:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
and are not just getting off the hook by
 
07:29:21.270 --> 07:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
by uh the provocation defense that could
 
07:29:23.388 --> 07:29:23.398 align:start position:0%
possibly be used it doesn't matter how
 
07:29:25.150 --> 07:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
many cases that's been used in New
 
07:29:26.750 --> 07:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's the fact that it can be
 
07:29:28.468 --> 07:29:28.478 align:start position:0%
used and we need to send a strong
 
07:29:30.070 --> 07:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
message in our state that we will not
 
07:29:33.350 --> 07:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
tolerate that and that trans nonbinary
 
07:29:36.590 --> 07:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
lgbtqia plus everyone will be included
 
07:29:38.628 --> 07:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
in our uh State and we'll make sure that
 
07:29:45.948 --> 07:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:48.910 --> 07:29:48.920 align:start position:0%

07:53:44.388 --> 07:53:44.398 align:start position:0%
House Bill 511 inexpedient to legislate
 
07:53:50.308 --> 07:53:50.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:52.468 --> 07:53:52.478 align:start position:0%
Wallace representative TR you wish to
 
07:53:55.670 --> 07:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:53:59.990 --> 07:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
in there was a there was a lot of talk
 
07:54:05.308 --> 07:54:05.318 align:start position:0%
about uh people needing help uh and not
 
07:54:07.548 --> 07:54:07.558 align:start position:0%
not throwing in in jail because they
 
07:54:11.468 --> 07:54:11.478 align:start position:0%
have a a drug problem
 
07:54:14.070 --> 07:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
but the
 
07:54:21.350 --> 07:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:23.868 --> 07:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
discussed not only shows me that the
 
07:54:27.350 --> 07:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
person would be selling those drugs but
 
07:54:28.910 --> 07:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
according to the bill did be allowed to
 
07:54:31.468 --> 07:54:31.478 align:start position:0%
sell them up to four times of being
 
07:54:35.030 --> 07:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
caught um this is to me this is about a
 
07:54:38.070 --> 07:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill authorizing the sale and that is
 
07:54:44.708 --> 07:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:52.430 --> 07:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:55.628 --> 07:54:55.638 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you very much Mr chair
 
07:54:58.430 --> 07:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
as I read this bill it does not address
 
07:55:01.430 --> 07:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
people who are actually selling drugs
 
07:55:04.830 --> 07:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
this bill impacts people who are
 
07:55:08.430 --> 07:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
basically caught in possession of drugs
 
07:55:10.788 --> 07:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
um and I think one of the things that we
 
07:55:12.190 --> 07:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
heard was some pretty compelling
 
07:55:15.230 --> 07:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
testimony around the fact that um
 
07:55:17.788 --> 07:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
different different people react in
 
07:55:21.708 --> 07:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
different ways to different doses um and
 
07:55:24.590 --> 07:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
absent the evidence that somebody is
 
07:55:27.510 --> 07:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
actually trying to sell the drugs uh to
 
07:55:32.830 --> 07:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
me it just seems to be um almost cruel G
 
07:55:34.868 --> 07:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
given the way that the opioid situation
 
07:55:37.150 --> 07:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
has hit our state and the way that so
 
07:55:39.750 --> 07:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
many people have just fallen into this
 
07:55:42.388 --> 07:55:42.398 align:start position:0%
trap sometimes almost through no you
 
07:55:42.398 --> 07:55:43.110 align:start position:0%
trap sometimes almost through no you
know

07:55:43.110 --> 07:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:55:45.990 --> 07:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
no you know no fault of their own
 
07:55:48.350 --> 07:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
they've just uh run with the wrong
 
07:55:50.548 --> 07:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
people they've gone with the wrong crowd
 
07:55:52.830 --> 07:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever to
 
07:55:54.708 --> 07:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
me it
 
07:55:58.430 --> 07:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
seems unnecessary uh and cruel to to
 
07:56:01.150 --> 07:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
keep our possession laws the way that
 
07:56:05.388 --> 07:56:05.398 align:start position:0%
they are um I think it's time that we
 
07:56:07.708 --> 07:56:07.718 align:start position:0%
try to different approach um the
 
07:56:10.548 --> 07:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
approach that we have tried for years
 
07:56:12.910 --> 07:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
and years and years uh we just hear one
 
07:56:15.430 --> 07:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
person after another coming up saying um
 
07:56:16.628 --> 07:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
07:56:20.708 --> 07:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
effective um so I say if you're selling
 
07:56:23.230 --> 07:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
if you're selling drugs you should get
 
07:56:25.750 --> 07:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
prosecuted to the full extent of the law
 
07:56:28.308 --> 07:56:28.318 align:start position:0%
but if you're caught with them I think
 
07:56:30.110 --> 07:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's a different situation and I think
 
07:56:33.990 --> 07:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
we need to as a as a body look at that
 
07:56:36.510 --> 07:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
situation with a lot more compassion
 
07:56:39.230 --> 07:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
especially given what the state has gone
 
07:56:41.910 --> 07:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
through over the last five or six years
 
07:56:44.948 --> 07:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
with the opioid crisis this is a crisis
 
07:56:49.510 --> 07:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
that has touched so many families um in
 
07:56:53.430 --> 07:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
such a difficult and painful way um and
 
07:56:56.350 --> 07:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill would actually go
 
07:56:58.510 --> 07:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
at least part of the way of of trying to
 
07:57:02.750 --> 07:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
put some of that behind us without um
 
07:57:05.270 --> 07:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
relieving penalties for people who are
 
07:57:11.230 --> 07:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:11.240 --> 07:57:14.230 align:start position:0%
 
Narcotics

07:57:14.230 --> 07:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
Narcotics
 
07:57:18.628 --> 07:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair um I
 
07:57:20.788 --> 07:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
really would like rather see us retain
 
07:57:23.190 --> 07:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
this bill rather than uh really
 
07:57:24.868 --> 07:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
07:57:28.548 --> 07:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
legislate uh we have just and then house
 
07:57:33.948 --> 07:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
just passed HB 615 which did reduce
 
07:57:36.788 --> 07:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
penalties for drug cases but we don't
 
07:57:39.750 --> 07:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
know what it will happen to it in the
 
07:57:42.430 --> 07:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
other body and what will happen to it
 
07:57:46.110 --> 07:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
when this it reaches the governor's desk
 
07:57:50.788 --> 07:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
if if it does re does not become law
 
07:57:55.468 --> 07:57:55.478 align:start position:0%
then we are to keep this for us to uh
 
07:57:59.628 --> 07:57:59.638 align:start position:0%
make changes what we need to uh drug
 
07:58:02.830 --> 07:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
penalties so I'm going to vote against
 
07:58:06.468 --> 07:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
the itl motion and hope for a another
 
07:58:08.150 --> 07:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
07:58:10.788 --> 07:58:10.798 align:start position:0%
retain thank
 
07:58:13.788 --> 07:58:13.798 align:start position:0%
you representative rhs thank you Mr
 
07:58:17.590 --> 07:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
chairman so um a couple of things
 
07:58:19.670 --> 07:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative us made a
 
07:58:22.910 --> 07:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
statement you know that you know you if
 
07:58:25.190 --> 07:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
a person is doing the drugs or person is
 
07:58:27.430 --> 07:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
selling the drugs about two different
 
07:58:30.430 --> 07:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
penalties you you can't sell them if you
 
07:58:32.150 --> 07:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't have them and now we're we're
 
07:58:34.110 --> 07:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
getting into a territory of trying to
 
07:58:36.468 --> 07:58:36.478 align:start position:0%
decide what the person's intent was and
 
07:58:39.070 --> 07:58:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative true made a good point of
 
07:58:41.270 --> 07:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
just how deadly a very small amount of
 
07:58:43.750 --> 07:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
some of these Jaws is and the other
 
07:58:46.670 --> 07:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
thing that I think we have to we have to
 
07:58:49.948 --> 07:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
take into consideration here is
 
07:58:52.388 --> 07:58:52.398 align:start position:0%
that everybody's tolerance level is
 
07:58:56.150 --> 07:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
different based on their usage and the
 
07:58:58.388 --> 07:58:58.398 align:start position:0%
long the more we keep on raising the bar
 
07:59:00.468 --> 07:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
of how much you're allowed to have the
 
07:59:02.590 --> 07:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
more the bar will be raised on how much
 
07:59:04.308 --> 07:59:04.318 align:start position:0%
people continue to push it so right now
 
07:59:07.070 --> 07:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
they know if oh you know the legal limit
 
07:59:08.990 --> 07:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
is this they're going to keep it right
 
07:59:11.070 --> 07:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
at or under that and then whenever we
 
07:59:12.350 --> 07:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
raise it they're going to they're just
 
07:59:14.350 --> 07:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
going to keep on raising it to to what
 
07:59:20.590 --> 07:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:23.230 --> 07:59:23.240 align:start position:0%

07:59:37.750 --> 07:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
that if somebody in this room was caught
 
07:59:38.868 --> 07:59:38.878 align:start position:0%
with a
 
07:59:41.350 --> 07:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
revolver playing Russian roulette
 
07:59:43.110 --> 07:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
somebody was sitting at this table right
 
07:59:46.190 --> 07:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
now playing Russian roulette they would
 
07:59:48.628 --> 07:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
be taken and brought to the conquered
 
07:59:51.350 --> 07:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
mental hospital for evaluation and maybe
 
07:59:54.830 --> 07:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
stay there for a month or two everybody
 
07:59:57.628 --> 07:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
that sticks a needle in their arm is
 
08:00:00.430 --> 08:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
playing Russian Roulette they have zero
 
08:00:03.270 --> 08:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
control over their lives anymore the the
 
08:00:06.590 --> 08:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
drug is making their decisions for them
 
08:00:09.070 --> 08:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
I know I heard testimony the testimony
 
08:00:11.510 --> 08:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
is not correct somebody who's on
 
08:00:15.270 --> 08:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or heroin is no longer in any
 
08:00:18.070 --> 08:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
way remotely in control of their
 
08:00:21.708 --> 08:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
faculties and should be put in treatment
 
08:00:23.468 --> 08:00:23.478 align:start position:0%
they should be taken to the state
 
08:00:26.628 --> 08:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
hospital put in there for evaluation and
 
08:00:28.430 --> 08:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
stay there until they're
 
08:00:30.868 --> 08:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
level and see if they will actually
 
08:00:32.990 --> 08:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
respond to getting help because they're
 
08:00:36.150 --> 08:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
going to die the idea of raising the the
 
08:00:39.150 --> 08:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh the the thing to four grams give need
 
08:00:44.350 --> 08:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
a break 500 a gr will kill 500 people
 
08:00:46.628 --> 08:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
you going raise it to four that that's
 
08:00:49.868 --> 08:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
insane I'm I'm vo ined to legisl we're
 
08:00:52.948 --> 08:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
doing this all wrong we're doing we're
 
08:00:55.830 --> 08:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
we're this there's this is not the right
 
08:00:58.270 --> 08:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
way to deal with this problem but given
 
08:00:59.830 --> 08:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
people a free ride and letting them get
 
08:01:02.788 --> 08:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
out of jail free for a few times only is
 
08:01:05.308 --> 08:01:05.318 align:start position:0%
enabling them to dig themselves deeper
 
08:01:06.430 --> 08:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
into the
 
08:01:14.990 --> 08:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:01:18.590 --> 08:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
you welcome I think there's a lot to
 
08:01:21.990 --> 08:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
unpack here I think what a represented
 
08:01:25.070 --> 08:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
of Hopper said some of it was I agree
 
08:01:28.590 --> 08:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
with is that if people are misusing
 
08:01:30.750 --> 08:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
something and self Haring they deserve
 
08:01:33.270 --> 08:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
to get treatment and what we're doing as
 
08:01:36.230 --> 08:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
a state now is making it worse we are
 
08:01:38.230 --> 08:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
not giving them treatment we're
 
08:01:40.868 --> 08:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
condemning them we're putting them in
 
08:01:44.830 --> 08:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
confinement on our people's dime and
 
08:01:48.230 --> 08:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
then they become get it back out they're
 
08:01:50.590 --> 08:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
homeless so it's contributing the
 
08:01:52.350 --> 08:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
situation because they didn't get the
 
08:01:54.548 --> 08:01:54.558 align:start position:0%
resources that they needed and then we
 
08:01:56.510 --> 08:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
arrest them again and then our people
 
08:01:58.468 --> 08:01:58.478 align:start position:0%
are paying for it again and it's this
 
08:02:02.788 --> 08:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
cycle right so um how do we help our
 
08:02:04.788 --> 08:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
people get the help that they deserve
 
08:02:08.868 --> 08:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
and need and how do we limit wasting our
 
08:02:10.948 --> 08:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
people's money for paying to have these
 
08:02:12.510 --> 08:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
people incarcerated when all they're
 
08:02:15.230 --> 08:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
doing is self Haring and with all due
 
08:02:17.788 --> 08:02:17.798 align:start position:0%
respect I think a lot of us don't know
 
08:02:20.990 --> 08:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
how drugs work because we're not drug
 
08:02:23.070 --> 08:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
abusers and I think that there's a lot
 
08:02:25.350 --> 08:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
of misinformation in this committee
 
08:02:27.030 --> 08:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
right now where people think they
 
08:02:28.708 --> 08:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
understand how much much something does
 
08:02:31.308 --> 08:02:31.318 align:start position:0%
and where it causes and what what harm
 
08:02:33.830 --> 08:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
it causes but then I think there's a
 
08:02:36.868 --> 08:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
complete lack of Education really
 
08:02:39.110 --> 08:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
understanding what these drugs do and
 
08:02:41.628 --> 08:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
what they're used for you know
 
08:02:44.230 --> 08:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of we're talking about we're
 
08:02:45.670 --> 08:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
trying to make the distinction between
 
08:02:48.388 --> 08:02:48.398 align:start position:0%
people starting a business and people
 
08:02:51.548 --> 08:02:51.558 align:start position:0%
that are self Haring and this bill
 
08:02:53.750 --> 08:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
clearly states that difference and we
 
08:02:55.990 --> 08:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
need to have compassion if we're going
 
08:02:58.868 --> 08:02:58.878 align:start position:0%
to help these people get over treatment
 
08:03:01.388 --> 08:03:01.398 align:start position:0%
and we we don't have that and we need to
 
08:03:03.350 --> 08:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
work in the right direction to give them
 
08:03:06.150 --> 08:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
a chance to access that care and I think
 
08:03:08.350 --> 08:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
this build is the right step in that
 
08:03:10.308 --> 08:03:10.318 align:start position:0%
direction to get that care instead of
 
08:03:12.308 --> 08:03:12.318 align:start position:0%
condemning the people that are suffering
 
08:03:14.590 --> 08:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
from illness and that we end up paying
 
08:03:21.750 --> 08:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:25.110 --> 08:03:25.120 align:start position:0%

motion and I would just say that uh in
 
08:06:13.468 --> 08:06:13.478 align:start position:0%
respect to the members of the public and
 
08:06:15.190 --> 08:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
08:06:17.548 --> 08:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
sponsor there's a lot of uh very
 
08:06:19.750 --> 08:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
important issues that were raised by
 
08:06:22.788 --> 08:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
testimony today a lot of things to put
 
08:06:26.430 --> 08:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
into consideration the bill has deadline
 
08:06:30.910 --> 08:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
of Mark 11 uh if we attempted to we
 
08:06:33.468 --> 08:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to meet in
 
08:06:36.830 --> 08:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
subcomittees so if we were to attempt to
 
08:06:38.070 --> 08:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
08:06:40.430 --> 08:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill I would be I'm confident we would
 
08:06:43.150 --> 08:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
not be doing the Justice or respected
 
08:06:47.110 --> 08:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
that the issues deserved so I would
 
08:06:49.830 --> 08:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
be I would be supporting the motion to
 
08:06:52.270 --> 08:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
retain and hope as a committee we can
 
08:06:54.110 --> 08:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
work together on this and try to address
 
08:06:56.708 --> 08:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
all these concerns raised by test
 
08:07:00.548 --> 08:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:02.548 --> 08:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
no just a
 
08:07:05.190 --> 08:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
question when you retain a bill does the
 
08:07:07.948 --> 08:07:07.958 align:start position:0%
amendment go with it the amendment
 
08:07:11.150 --> 08:07:11.160 align:start position:0%

08:07:12.788 --> 08:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
not like the amend we keep the amendment
 
08:07:16.308 --> 08:07:16.318 align:start position:0%
for our own knowledge
 
08:07:18.708 --> 08:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
because yeah we still have it it's not
 
08:07:20.468 --> 08:07:20.478 align:start position:0%

have trying to come up with another

08:10:40.750 --> 08:10:40.760 align:start position:0%

yes I I think we have a duty to the

state of New Hampshire to protect all
 
08:11:03.990 --> 08:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
people including those that um are
 
08:11:06.830 --> 08:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
different amongst us and clearly there
 
08:11:11.948 --> 08:11:11.958 align:start position:0%
is something wrong in our law that
 
08:11:13.830 --> 08:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
basically allows somebody to commit
 
08:11:16.708 --> 08:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
murder when they feel like they've had a
 
08:11:20.030 --> 08:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
pass made at them and that is just
 
08:11:22.788 --> 08:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
unacceptable um if you're gonna vote to
 
08:11:24.990 --> 08:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
kill this you're sending a clear message
 
08:11:27.830 --> 08:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
to the people of New Hampshire that you
 
08:11:30.750 --> 08:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
don't support protecting lgbtq Plus
 
08:11:34.708 --> 08:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
members thank you night we not we're not
 
08:11:36.830 --> 08:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to speak to the intent of the
 
08:11:37.910 --> 08:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
08:11:40.990 --> 08:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
members uh including anything implied in
 
08:11:43.590 --> 08:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
their vote uh and this also will not
 
08:11:46.230 --> 08:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
legally justify any type of lawful
 
08:11:48.708 --> 08:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
killing it's simply a bill that involves
 
08:11:48.718 --> 08:11:49.468 align:start position:0%
killing it's simply a bill that involves
the

08:11:49.468 --> 08:11:49.478 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:11:51.788 --> 08:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
mitigation of someone who's charged with
 
08:11:53.468 --> 08:11:53.478 align:start position:0%
second degree murder and simultaneous
 
08:11:56.350 --> 08:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
man water they will not be they're not
 
08:11:58.070 --> 08:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to be convicted both simply a
 
08:12:00.468 --> 08:12:00.478 align:start position:0%
mitigation a mitigation
 
08:12:03.430 --> 08:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
defense to second degree murder no one's
 
08:12:05.788 --> 08:12:05.798 align:start position:0%
getting away with killing
 
08:12:09.308 --> 08:12:09.318 align:start position:0%
someone so just to clarify that I don't
 
08:12:10.590 --> 08:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
believe anyone in this committee would
 
08:12:12.030 --> 08:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
support someone getting away with
 
08:12:18.830 --> 08:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:12:21.468 --> 08:12:21.478 align:start position:0%
sexuality thank you Mr chairman I think
 
08:12:24.230 --> 08:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
that you and the attorney are have
 
08:12:27.948 --> 08:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
misread this bill this is not a bill
 
08:12:27.958 --> 08:12:28.868 align:start position:0%
misread this bill this is not a bill
that

08:12:28.868 --> 08:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:12:28.878 --> 08:12:30.468 align:start position:0%
that
allows

08:12:30.468 --> 08:12:30.478 align:start position:0%
allows
 
08:12:36.430 --> 08:12:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh you to uh go from murder to Def to
 
08:12:41.590 --> 08:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
manslaughter this is only to exclude a
 
08:12:44.830 --> 08:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh defense against
 
08:12:44.840 --> 08:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
uh defense against
manslaughter

08:12:47.670 --> 08:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
manslaughter
 
08:12:50.948 --> 08:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
um I myself think that it's a good deal
 
08:12:58.830 --> 08:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:13:01.670 --> 08:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
so I'll explain representative B I just
 
08:13:03.670 --> 08:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
and I'll just admit I've never worked on
 
08:13:06.548 --> 08:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
on a murder case in my professional
 
08:13:10.070 --> 08:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
career but I will but I am my
 
08:13:11.468 --> 08:13:11.478 align:start position:0%
understanding is quite often when
 
08:13:14.590 --> 08:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
someone's charged with manslaughter that
 
08:13:16.868 --> 08:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
when it involve violence it's often
 
08:13:18.750 --> 08:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
second Dee murder is often charged as
 
08:13:20.590 --> 08:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
well where you wouldn't have a
 
08:13:21.868 --> 08:13:21.878 align:start position:0%
conviction of
 
08:13:24.590 --> 08:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
both but you could have conviction one
 
08:13:25.548 --> 08:13:25.558 align:start position:0%
but not the
 
08:13:29.070 --> 08:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
other with this would do if and
 
08:13:30.548 --> 08:13:30.558 align:start position:0%
basically the facts that described in
 
08:13:32.990 --> 08:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
the testimony you wouldn't be able to
 
08:13:36.388 --> 08:13:36.398 align:start position:0%
claim this as a reason what that caused
 
08:13:40.150 --> 08:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
you to lose control to no longer be
 
08:13:44.150 --> 08:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
obje be objectively reasonable or and
 
08:13:46.468 --> 08:13:46.478 align:start position:0%
made you lose your pool and that's why
 
08:13:49.070 --> 08:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
you lost all control of yourself you're
 
08:13:51.350 --> 08:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
not going to claim that as a
 
08:13:55.548 --> 08:13:55.558 align:start position:0%
reason to mitigate second Remer to man
 
08:13:57.110 --> 08:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's but this doesn't need to
 
08:13:59.150 --> 08:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned second murder doesn't need to
 
08:14:01.150 --> 08:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
address that that's a different that's
 
08:14:05.388 --> 08:14:05.398 align:start position:0%
RSA will be not impacted at all so
 
08:14:09.110 --> 08:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
I this is not a flat out defense toand
 
08:14:11.590 --> 08:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll recognize representative board
 
08:14:13.830 --> 08:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
a to respond to what I just said even
 
08:14:16.708 --> 08:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
though not there other members hands on
 
08:14:19.548 --> 08:14:19.558 align:start position:0%
I hope no one raises a point Thank you
 
08:14:23.628 --> 08:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um maybe I'm misreading the uh
 
08:14:27.990 --> 08:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
the rsas but um
 
08:14:31.990 --> 08:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
630 2 is devoted only to manslaughter it
 
08:14:34.750 --> 08:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with homicide and this
 
08:14:37.190 --> 08:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
is where this paragraph is being
 
08:14:41.468 --> 08:14:41.478 align:start position:0%
inserted it is being inserted as this is
 
08:14:49.228 --> 08:14:49.238 align:start position:0%
 
08:14:52.190 --> 08:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
water I'll read it again but
 
08:14:58.510 --> 08:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:00.670 --> 08:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative time to do it you can
 
08:15:03.548 --> 08:15:03.558 align:start position:0%
talk to me sometime when we have more
 
08:15:05.990 --> 08:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
time on our
 
08:15:08.910 --> 08:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
hands thank you Mr chairman I would like
 
08:15:12.948 --> 08:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
to see this bill passed with it such an
 
08:15:17.270 --> 08:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
animosity out there nowadays we haven't
 
08:15:21.110 --> 08:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
had it happen in our state but it could
 
08:15:23.270 --> 08:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
I remember years ago
 
08:15:27.548 --> 08:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
when elg was out that they
 
08:15:30.468 --> 08:15:30.478 align:start position:0%
would beat a man half to death because
 
08:15:32.430 --> 08:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
they found out he
 
08:15:36.670 --> 08:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
might be gay so I don't think it hurts
 
08:15:40.548 --> 08:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
anything to put this on the books it
 
08:15:43.350 --> 08:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened and maybe it never will
 
08:15:49.590 --> 08:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
08:15:51.868 --> 08:15:51.878 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
08:15:55.430 --> 08:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
Muse Mr chairman um we heard that
 
08:15:57.948 --> 08:15:57.958 align:start position:0%
intoxication and adult
 
08:16:00.308 --> 08:16:00.318 align:start position:0%
aren't acceptable defenses and and I
 
08:16:02.468 --> 08:16:02.478 align:start position:0%
think a pretty good case was made today
 
08:16:05.910 --> 08:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
that a person's identity um should also
 
08:16:09.750 --> 08:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
not be grounds uh for them to be
 
08:16:13.628 --> 08:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
victimized in this way um I think one of
 
08:16:16.070 --> 08:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
the things you know I've been kind of
 
08:16:19.350 --> 08:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
looking for an analogy and I think this
 
08:16:22.868 --> 08:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
situation is very much analogous to a
 
08:16:25.150 --> 08:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
lynching defense that would center
 
08:16:26.990 --> 08:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
around a person being triggered by
 
08:16:29.708 --> 08:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
seeing black people and in many parts of
 
08:16:31.830 --> 08:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
the country that was an acceptable
 
08:16:35.510 --> 08:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
defense until not too many years ago I I
 
08:16:37.788 --> 08:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
I think I think that passing a bill like
 
08:16:40.868 --> 08:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
this um is part of the process that we
 
08:16:46.070 --> 08:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
need to make as Society um
 
08:16:49.670 --> 08:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
to essentially get to a point where all
 
08:16:51.430 --> 08:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
of our people have equal protection
 
08:16:54.150 --> 08:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
under the law uh and really do have
 
08:16:57.308 --> 08:16:57.318 align:start position:0%
equal protection under the law um I I've
 
08:17:00.548 --> 08:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
yet to see a bill come across uh uh come
 
08:17:05.190 --> 08:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
across our desks uh this term um that
 
08:17:07.750 --> 08:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
that isn't more about that than than
 
08:17:10.948 --> 08:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill uh so I'm going to
 
08:17:13.788 --> 08:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl
 
08:17:16.910 --> 08:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
motion iire a
 
08:17:19.110 --> 08:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
question you said
 
08:17:23.628 --> 08:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
that man excuse me that adultery would
 
08:17:28.468 --> 08:17:28.478 align:start position:0%
not be um grounded as a mitiga defense
 
08:17:32.110 --> 08:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
to claim that you can't be objectively
 
08:17:35.270 --> 08:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable is that in New Hampshire law
 
08:17:37.430 --> 08:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
so I didn't I'm just wondering I
 
08:17:40.468 --> 08:17:40.478 align:start position:0%
didn't weird testimony from the uh the
 
08:17:45.548 --> 08:17:45.558 align:start position:0%
person from the lgbtq btq bar um that uh
 
08:17:48.228 --> 08:17:48.238 align:start position:0%
that was the case I'm not 100% sure if
 
08:17:51.110 --> 08:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
that that's the case in New Hampshire uh
 
08:17:52.910 --> 08:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
but it sounded like that case in some
 
08:17:52.920 --> 08:17:53.670 align:start position:0%
but it sounded like that case in some
other

08:17:53.670 --> 08:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
other
 
08:17:58.110 --> 08:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
states um and if if it is pretty and
 
08:17:59.510 --> 08:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's not the law in New Hampshire we
 
08:18:06.750 --> 08:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:09.308 --> 08:18:09.318 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
08:18:13.190 --> 08:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
Bradley thank you um I really feel like
 
08:18:14.868 --> 08:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
this is a good bill and that we should
 
08:18:18.350 --> 08:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
be we should be trying to pass it it it
 
08:18:21.228 --> 08:18:21.238 align:start position:0%
just I agree with representative Klein
 
08:18:24.150 --> 08:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
night that if if we itl this bill it
 
08:18:25.628 --> 08:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
just sends a clear message to the people
 
08:18:28.468 --> 08:18:28.478 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and it's
 
08:18:34.948 --> 08:18:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:18:37.708 --> 08:18:37.718 align:start position:0%
itl representative Conley thank you Mr
 
08:18:41.150 --> 08:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
chairman we heard testimony today that
 
08:18:44.430 --> 08:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
this Panic defense let people
 
08:18:47.388 --> 08:18:47.398 align:start position:0%
concoct a defense that may or may not be
 
08:18:48.750 --> 08:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
based in
 
08:18:51.190 --> 08:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
reality and depending on the jury that
 
08:18:53.190 --> 08:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
they draw and the prejudices those
 
08:18:53.200 --> 08:18:54.468 align:start position:0%
they draw and the prejudices those
jurors

08:18:54.468 --> 08:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
jurors
 
08:18:56.990 --> 08:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
have um
 
08:18:57.000 --> 08:18:57.830 align:start position:0%
have um
about

08:18:57.830 --> 08:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
08:19:02.030 --> 08:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
LG btq plus people to then potentially
 
08:19:03.548 --> 08:19:03.558 align:start position:0%
allow for reduced
 
08:19:06.468 --> 08:19:06.478 align:start position:0%
sence um this is a type of defense that
 
08:19:09.708 --> 08:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
is unique in our statute one sexual
 
08:19:12.750 --> 08:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
orientation should not be used uh the
 
08:19:14.788 --> 08:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
victim sexual orientation should not be
 
08:19:19.430 --> 08:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
used as a mitiga offense um we we heard
 
08:19:21.510 --> 08:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
testimony that a number of states have
 
08:19:23.948 --> 08:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
done this red States blue
 
08:19:32.628 --> 08:19:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
08:19:32.638 --> 08:19:33.948 align:start position:0%
 
represent

08:19:33.948 --> 08:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
represent
 
08:19:37.030 --> 08:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
Newman thank you Mr chair and I also
 
08:19:39.468 --> 08:19:39.478 align:start position:0%
believe this is a good bill and I I I
 
08:19:42.070 --> 08:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
believe that from the testimony we heard
 
08:19:45.830 --> 08:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
today that this te that the um this
 
08:19:49.110 --> 08:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
mitigation effort because of the sexual
 
08:19:52.430 --> 08:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
orientation of the victim it can
 
08:19:56.270 --> 08:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
objectively not be used when someone
 
08:19:59.388 --> 08:19:59.398 align:start position:0%
could potentially be uh convicted of
 
08:20:02.030 --> 08:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
murder or second deegree murder so
 
08:20:03.750 --> 08:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's my take on the bill for my two
 
08:20:07.670 --> 08:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:11.830 --> 08:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
you guys thank you Mr chairman I
 
08:20:13.228 --> 08:20:13.238 align:start position:0%
seconded the
 
08:20:17.990 --> 08:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
itl and my reasoning for doing that is
 
08:20:20.948 --> 08:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
couple a couple of reasons one of them
 
08:20:25.070 --> 08:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
to start with is our constitution
 
08:20:27.270 --> 08:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
already covers everybody
 
08:20:29.670 --> 08:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
and we're not are we looking to carve
 
08:20:32.670 --> 08:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
out and if we're going to carve out one
 
08:20:34.308 --> 08:20:34.318 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
08:20:36.990 --> 08:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
today then tomorrow somebody's going to
 
08:20:39.548 --> 08:20:39.558 align:start position:0%
want to carve out the Liberals for
 
08:20:43.190 --> 08:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:20:47.030 --> 08:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
conservatives there yeah we just we
 
08:20:49.990 --> 08:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't need to use that type of R we just
 
08:20:52.788 --> 08:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
try to may I continue then you may
 
08:20:54.430 --> 08:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
continue but referring to people as
 
08:20:56.750 --> 08:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
liberals conservative that does not
 
08:21:00.228 --> 08:21:00.238 align:start position:0%
provide any productive thought to okay
 
08:21:03.388 --> 08:21:03.398 align:start position:0%
we're all members in that's fine well we
 
08:21:07.548 --> 08:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
refer to people as gay or lbgs and so on
 
08:21:10.308 --> 08:21:10.318 align:start position:0%
and so forth and we want to C them out
 
08:21:13.548 --> 08:21:13.558 align:start position:0%
and say they got special privileges our
 
08:21:15.830 --> 08:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
constitution of New Hampshire as I
 
08:21:18.628 --> 08:21:18.638 align:start position:0%
understand it covers everybody to begin
 
08:21:22.270 --> 08:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
with and we only a number of years ago
 
08:21:24.830 --> 08:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
amended our constitution about
 
08:21:27.708 --> 08:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
discrimination towards some
 
08:21:29.628 --> 08:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't want to do that
 
08:21:32.070 --> 08:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying we don't want to
 
08:21:35.670 --> 08:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
have special privileges for special
 
08:21:38.590 --> 08:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
people we're all the same group we're
 
08:21:41.990 --> 08:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
all the same people if you kill somebody
 
08:21:44.228 --> 08:21:44.238 align:start position:0%
you should be charged for murder and
 
08:21:46.070 --> 08:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
then you should be tried on it and
 
08:21:48.110 --> 08:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
there's no way in heck that you're going
 
08:21:51.308 --> 08:21:51.318 align:start position:0%
to be able to say well because he or she
 
08:21:58.628 --> 08:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
