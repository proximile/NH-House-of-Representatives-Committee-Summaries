tremendous amount of thoughts and with

the recent events regarding my health

as I mentioned to you before when I
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
first attempted to resign was that I
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
feel as though I cannot represent

Rockingham one effectively if I am on

struggled with since our conversation I
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
am not one to take a position and not
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
fulfill the obligation that comes with
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
it that's not fair to my constituents

the house or you or me whatever energy I
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
have left I must use it to focus taking
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Senate Bill 77
 
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
mandates all school boards approved

taxpayer-funded tuition agreements with

private schools
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
under current law this is an option
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
school boards have now especially if the
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
school district does not operate its own
 
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:35.580 align:start position:0%

but this bills a wolf in sheep's
 
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.450 align:start position:0%
but this bills a wolf in sheep's
clothing

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
clothing
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
proponents of Senate Bill 77 describe it
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
as housekeeping we've all heard that
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
before just tidying up some loose ends
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
that must have accidentally been omitted
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
back when the Manifest education
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
hardship law was changed four years ago
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
following a strong bipartisan effort
 
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
that law allows a parent or Guardian to
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
request a change of school assignment
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
when a student is experiencing an
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
education hardship at school
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
and by law change of school assignments
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
can be made to another public school or
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
to an approved private school it's rare
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's done administratively and it's done
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
with little or no additional cost to the
 
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
school district
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
so at a minimum Senate Bill 77 is
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
totally unnecessary since assignments
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
are already being made to another public
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
school or particularly when a district
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
does not operate its own public schools
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
to another approved private school
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 77 abuses the intent of the law and
 
00:26:48.789 --> 00:26:48.799 align:start position:0%
mandates all school boards approve
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded tuition agreements with
 
00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
private schools even when the district
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
has their own schools
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
it's Sneaky it's deceptive and it abuses
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
an important provision in education law
 
00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
meant to help kids bring it into a
 
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.649 align:start position:0%
meant to help kids bring it into a
directive

00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
directive
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
to approve private private schools
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
tuition programs at taxpayer expense
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
it even goes so far as to require
 
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.289 align:start position:0%
it even goes so far as to require
schools

00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:27:18.299 --> 00:27:19.669 align:start position:0%
schools
approve

00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
approve
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
private schools approved by other school
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
boards in other school districts and I
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
bet your constituents are going to love
 
00:27:26.159 --> 00:27:28.730 align:start position:0%
bet your constituents are going to love
that

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
so some people don't care about the
 
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
destruction of our high performance
 
00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
public schools and the opportunities and
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
strong outcomes these schools provide
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
the children of New Hampshire about 165
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
000 kids and their families across the
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
state do
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
and so do property taxpayers who approve
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
local school budgets and reach deep into
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
their pockets to make up for the lack of
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
State funding a responsibility the
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislature has shirked for too long
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
so think hard about this vote
 
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
think hard about asking your
 
00:28:03.529 --> 00:28:03.539 align:start position:0%
constituents especially those retired
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
living on fixed incomes to dig deeper
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
and use their property taxes to pay for
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
private school tuition bills when
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're already paying for public
 
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.930 align:start position:0%
they're already paying for public
schools

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to explain this one
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
so for kids families and taxpayers
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the ought to pass
 
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.570 align:start position:0%
please vote no on the ought to pass
motion

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I do request a
 
00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.100 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
that's not what this bill is all about
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
when we talk about manifest education
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
hardship and some of you may not be
 
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
familiar with that terminology we have
 
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
in education law it's been around for of
 
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.549 align:start position:0%

years

within the Minority Report
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
it says it's a relatively New Concept a
 
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:06.140 align:start position:0%
new education leadership program
 
00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:10.460 align:start position:0%
hardship program it's not backend
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
2013 I can recall modifying the Manifest
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
education our shoot statutes based upon
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
what was being done in Cambridge
 
00:29:21.409 --> 00:29:21.419 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts at that time it was also
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
part of No Child Left Behind
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
the purpose of manifest education and
 
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.610 align:start position:0%
the purpose of manifest education and
hardship

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
hardship
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
is not to provide another choice
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
for everybody to go well I don't like
 
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700 align:start position:0%
this school I'm going to go to another
 
00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:38.779 align:start position:0%
one that is not what it was designed for
 
00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
in fact in working cooperatively would
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school boards
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
Association and other groups we came
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
forward with legislation and that's now
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
statutory law that says this is what
 
00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
Emmanuel a manifest education hardship
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
is for
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
such hardship must be so severe
 
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
pervasive or persistent that it
 
00:30:04.789 --> 00:30:04.799 align:start position:0%
interferes with or limits the ability of
 
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
a student to receive an education it's
 
00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
not where a parent can walk in the door
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
and say I want my student going to
 
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
school a over there because they have a
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
better algebra program there than they
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
have in school B
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
that's none irrational or the hardship
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
the hardship is for those situations
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
those rare situations in which a child
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
is being bullied to the point where they
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
can't make it in the present school I
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
experienced that in my own family
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
ADI youngster in the Middle School who
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
is now standing athlete
 
00:30:42.649 --> 00:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
but was being bullied over and over we
 
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
talked for the counselor we talked with
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
the principal they understood it but it
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
didn't stop
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
it went on because the kids were
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
bullying the other my that youngster
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
so we looked at what are we going to do
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
back in those days I did not have the
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
option of manifest education hardship I
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
had to take and pay for that youngster
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
to go to another school where she
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
thrived has now been on the Dean's List
 
00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
at the University of Maine for four
 
00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
consecutive years captain of the indoor
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
and outdoor track team set all kinds of
 
00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
Records here in New England
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
in the pentathlon so these options have
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
to be available they are available now
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
and if this occurs within a school
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
district that school district through
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
the school board has the option
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
of sending a student to another public
 
00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
school private school or non-public
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
school in their District or a school
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
outside their District
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
and the schools that they're sending to
 
00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:43.980 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go out and say well
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to prove this private school
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
so we can go there we have the
 
00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Education right now that's
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
already approved how many here 98
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
schools for attendance they've approved
 
00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
98 schools for attendance which are
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
non-public schools they've also approved
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
another 40 schools
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
which have shown that they've gone
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
through the accreditation process New
 
00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
England Association schools and colleges
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
the New England Association The
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
Independent Schools and three others
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
that is a real trip to get that type of
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
accreditation in fact it's in our
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
statutes as one of the methodologies for
 
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.370 align:start position:0%
statutes as one of the methodologies for
uh

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
accountability for providing the
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
adequate education we are supposed to be
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
providing to all kids in conclusion
 
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:32.220 align:start position:0%
this bill is a result of an oversight in
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
legislation which was put forth several
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
years ago there are six sections of law
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
which speak to this area where you can
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
send students to as if there's a
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
manifest education hardship found
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
this simply corrects an Aaron statue in
 
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
the five or six paragraphs the private
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
school alternative is mentioned along
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
with Public Schools a public Academy
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
Etc but however in the sixth paragraph
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
where that was supposed to be changed
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
there was oversight and drafting that
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
was not made so what we're trying to do
 
00:33:08.529 --> 00:33:08.539 align:start position:0%
is have all six sections in this chapter
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
agree and parallel each other thank you
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Speaker
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
representative San Andreas
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
there's a member of yield the questions
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
remember it does not yield
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
representative San Antonio has requested
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
a roll call it is sufficiently seconded
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
motion before us is ought to pass on
 
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 77 this is a roll call vote
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Tanner
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
if I know
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
that this is not a simple change in
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
wording or an oversight to a
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
long-standing collaborative process that
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
has happened between public schools to
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
place students who are experiencing
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
extreme manifest hardship to another
 
00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.060 align:start position:0%
Public School
 
00:34:42.109 --> 00:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
if I know this change will has the
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
consequence that will force local school
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
districts to pay full tuition rates at
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
many schools now non-public private even
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
out-of-state schools
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
if I know as a result of this change
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
that there will be a substantial
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
increase in the financial burden on
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
local schools resulting in a raise of
 
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
local property taxes
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
and if I know I don't want to explain to
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
my constituents why I raise their
 
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
property taxes then would I press the
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
red button to vote no so that another
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
more responsible motion can be made
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Ladd for
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill simply corrects a
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
technical emission made during the last
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
update to the Manifest education
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
hardship statute
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
and if I know this does not raise your
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
if I know manifest education hardship is
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
rightfully available as an alternative
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
education placement granted only in such
 
00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:58.220 align:start position:0%
hardship cases where it's severe
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
pervasive or persistent
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
would I then support this proven program
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
that's in the best interest of students
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker good morning
colleagues

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
I'd like to talk to you for a moment
 
00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:47.099 align:start position:0%
about our amendment to SB 152 what this
 
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill does is it creates two new Pathways
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
within the Career Technical education
 
00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
departments in schools and high schools
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
it creates a marine trades pathway and
 
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
it creates an offshore wind energy
 
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.870 align:start position:0%
it creates an offshore wind energy
pathway

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
pathway
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
now if we're going to be using taxpayer
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
money to train students for specific
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
type jobs this should be an investment
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
that comes out good for both the student
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayer
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
the Marine trades portion of this bill
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
appears to be a good fit however the
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
offshore wind energy does not first of
 
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:27.950 align:start position:0%
offshore wind energy does not first of
all

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
these offshore wind jobs do not yet
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
exist here
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
they are prospective jobs and we should
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
not be training students for something
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
that we don't know is even going to
 
00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.910 align:start position:0%
that we don't know is even going to
exist

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
and if we do we can expect that in
 
00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
coming years there will be further
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
lobbying of this body to further
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
subsidize this industry to create the
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
jobs that we have trained these students
 
00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.270 align:start position:0%
jobs that we have trained these students
for

00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
offshore wind is one of the most
 
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:03.180 align:start position:0%
expensive and already most subsidized
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
forms of energy available
 
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:07.140 align:start position:0%
and that would appear to make this
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
primarily a special interest bill with
 
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
this provision in it
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
this is not green energy we're talking
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
about here we cherish our Coastline in
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
we cherish our biodiversity and we
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
depend on it economically
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
there has been a long documented history
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
of offshore wind resulting in Marine
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
Mammal die-offs and damage to
 
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.829 align:start position:0%
Mammal die-offs and damage to
biodiversity

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
biodiversity
 
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
turbines do experience failures and when
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
they do they often dump copious amounts
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
of oil
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
further the carbon Breakeven point for
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
turbines often exceeds their useful life
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
finally this program has inadequate
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
oversight it creates a commission with
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
the ability to spend money yet it does
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
not appoint a single person from this
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
lastly for those against the bill who
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
were inclined against the entire thing
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
please know
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
it is likely this bill will pass today
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes this bill better
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you to please vote Yes to
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
remove the wind energy pathway and keep
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
the Marine trades pathway in this bill
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
and I would ask for a division
 
00:41:28.849 --> 00:41:28.859 align:start position:0%
because remember does a member yield the
 
00:41:28.859 --> 00:41:31.730 align:start position:0%
because remember does a member yield the
questions

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that these
 
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.220 align:start position:0%
windmills cannot operate with a wind
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
speed Beyond 35 miles an hour is that
 
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.690 align:start position:0%
speed Beyond 35 miles an hour is that
correct

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to the specific
 
00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
specifications of the windmills in
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
question but I do know they are in fact
 
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
Limited in their capacity to a certain
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
this floor Amendment strips sections two
 
00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:29.339 align:start position:0%
three and four from the bill
 
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
there are five sections by doing so the
 
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
amendment eliminates the non-lapsing
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker a question of the chair
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
let's answer your question
 
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
in light of RSA 1449 describing
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
commissions describing the legislative
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
role in commissions and I can read that
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
if necessary is Senate Bill 152
 
00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:16.790 align:start position:0%
if necessary is Senate Bill 152
divisible

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
two three and four are divisible

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I move to divide
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.079 --> 00:50:56.410 align:start position:0%

00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
ER the most the first motion before us
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
will be whether we authorize dividing
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
the question if that be the case then
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
we'll take up each individual's uh one
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative Poole has requested a

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is a question on
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
dividing the question
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
if this motion passes 1 5 and 6 will be
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
voted on and two three and four will be
 
00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
voted on separately
 
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
so the motion is on dividing the
 
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
question this is going to be a roll call
 
00:52:47.819 --> 00:52:49.609 align:start position:0%

00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
if I know that our statutes require that
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
any committee established by the general
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
court have a particular makeup if I know
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
that that makeup needs to be less than
 
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
15 members
 
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
and more importantly if I know the

majority of that committee shall be
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
members of the general court
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
would I now vote to divide the question
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%

00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
deals with legislative study committees
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
and commissions and if I know this is
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
not a legislative committee this is a
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
committee similar to what we have with
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
the higher education commission which
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%

relevant to what we're discussing today
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%

process that this bill contains many
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%

01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
these two ultimatums are designed to

undermine our state's autonomy

the first automatic demands that we

repeal our state law
 
01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:36.540 align:start position:0%

seven days before any similar contest
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
the second ultimatum demands that we
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
pass legislation
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
making absentee balloting permissible

these ultimatums pose a grave challenge

to our state's long-standing traditions

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
so you can find press articles backing
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
up what I'm saying
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
is The Superficial obsession
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
with identity politics
 
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
and what they say is a lack of diversity
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
some members of the DNC
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
have cited as rationale for why our
 
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
state shouldn't have first the nation
 
01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:26.450 align:start position:0%
state shouldn't have first the nation
primary

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
this is an insult to our voters
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
and it sends the message that somehow
 
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
we're defective
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
because of attributes with which
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
we were born
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
we in New Hampshire disagree with that
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
assessment we believe in individualism
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
the importance of judging individuals by
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
the content of their character not the
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
color of their skin
 
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
opinions are not discounted because of
 
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.209 align:start position:0%
opinions are not discounted because of
superficial

01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
superficial
 
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
physical attributes
 
01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.150 align:start position:0%
physical attributes

01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
these actions by the DNC not only
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
threaten our state's cherished tradition
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
but also undermine the Democratic
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
principles upon which our country was
 
01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.970 align:start position:0%
principles upon which our country was
founded

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:07.980 align:start position:0%
founded
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
so now while the Republican Party enjoys
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
a dynamic primary with many candidates
 
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
visiting and engaging with our voters
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
the Democratic party is sadly left
 
01:09:18.839 --> 01:09:20.090 align:start position:0%
the Democratic party is sadly left
stagnant

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
stagnant
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
unable to engage with Challengers
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
to the president
 
01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
such as Marianne Williamson and Robert F
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
Kennedy Jr and maybe others
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
this is robbing many New Hampshire
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
Democratic voters of the opportunity
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
to have their voices heard
 
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
think of it
 
01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:43.940 align:start position:0%
Democratic candidates will be sanctioned
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
if they campaign in our state
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
if they spend money on Advertising
 
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
our sitting president will not have his
 
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
name on the Democratic primary ballot in
 
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
our state an ultimate snub to our voters
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
Democratic voters will need to conduct a
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
write-in campaign
 
01:10:12.169 --> 01:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
if they choose if they even choose to
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
support him
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
so let's send a message today that we
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
stand United in our resolve to preserve
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary
 
01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
we are voting on a joint resolution that
 
01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
does two things
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
it affirms the general Court's support
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
for the first of the nation presidential
 
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:33.590 align:start position:0%
for the first of the nation presidential
primary

01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
and demands that all political parties
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
respect the results of New Hampshire's
 
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
primary by seeding the delegates of the
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
candidates selected by our voters at
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
their National nominating conferences
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
so let's Stand Together United
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
a defense of New Hampshire's first in
 
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
the nation presidential primary
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
and against these unjust ultimatums and
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
sanctions being threatened by the
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
Democratic National Committee
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
I implore you colleagues and Mr Speaker
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
to join me in concurring with the Senate
 
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
and the Senate's resolution
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
preserving this tradition that has
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
withstood the test of time in New
 
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.270 align:start position:0%
withstood the test of time in New
Hampshire

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
let us not allow the divisive agendas of
 
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.709 align:start position:0%
let us not allow the divisive agendas of
others

01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
to overshadow the Democratic principles
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
that we hold dear
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
speaker

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
I agree that we need to provide bias
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
partisan strong bipartisan support as
 
01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.790 align:start position:0%
partisan strong bipartisan support as
does

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
all of my caucus and they are working
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
hard as well as our federal delegation
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Democratic party
 
01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
in that effort to retain the first in
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
the nation primary this is one of
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
several bills that have been before the
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
election law committee on this topic and
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
while the Democratic National Committee
 
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
can adjust their calendar
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
our primary date is set in statute so
 
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
they cannot change and we are not
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
changing our statute despite the
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
pressure that was mentioned by this
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
previous speaker
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
what's helped us keep the first in the
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
nation primary is that Democrats and
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
Republicans work together to protect our
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
primary New Hampshire worked hard over
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
the 20th century to grow our first in
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
the nation primary
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
all these other states that have
 
01:12:54.649 --> 01:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
primaries saw the success that we have
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
and have followed our lead
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
we have worked very hard to
 
01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
build it and we're working very hard to
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
retain it in 2008 and 2012 when the
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
Republican presidential primary was
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
being threatened by the Republican
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
National Committee new hampshires
 
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats work together
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
to defend it and we're doing that again
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
in that Spirit of bipartisan cooperation
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
I urge all of my colleagues to pass this
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%

01:13:37.370 --> 01:13:37.380 align:start position:0%

adopted the motion before us now is
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended chair
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker Senate Bill 149 is a reaction
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
to a real problem however it will do
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
nothing to solve the problem but rather
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
exacerbate it
 
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to solve the later
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
labor shortage in nursing and lower the
 
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
cost of nursing labor by making it more
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
difficult for nursing agencies to do
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire write
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
contracts provide transparent pricing
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
and hire employees
 
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the government does not
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
understand that people respond to
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
incentives they expect that when
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
sentences changed then people will
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
behave exactly as they did before
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
by adding licensing to nurse agencies
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
not only do we increase compliance costs
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
requiring nursing communities to charge
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
more but we discourage the allocation of
 
01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
nursing labor into New Hampshire
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
compliance costs include people filling
 
01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
out paperwork in the private sector and
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
people filing paperwork in the public
 
01:20:13.070 --> 01:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
sector these are people that could be
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
doing something useful in reducing the
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
labor shorts this bill is pretending to
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
work on
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
if we want our health care facilities to
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
have more access to labor then we would
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
open the doors wide open instead of
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
adding compliance rules
 
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
additionally if a nursing agency is
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
found to be out of compliance they will
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
lose their license and be forced to do
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
business outside the state and take
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
their traveling nurses with them
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this bill stipulates the
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
conditions about how agencies can commit
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
nurses to facilities
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
this should just be an agreement between
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
the agency and the health care facility
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
making it more difficult for these
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
organizations to contract with each
 
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
other does not increase the number of
 
01:20:55.729 --> 01:20:55.739 align:start position:0%
nurses in the economy and it does not
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
decrease the demand for nurses in the
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
economy it will only make the health
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
care facilities more desperate and agree
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
to contracts that are more onerous and
 
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.910 align:start position:0%
to contracts that are more onerous and
expensive

01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this bill prohibits under
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
which conditions a nursing agency May
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
charge higher prices
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
like if a health care facility has a
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
virus or isn't a jurisdiction that isn't
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
a public health emergency
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
if I'm a nurse and I'm offered a bid on
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
two jobs
 
01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
one where there is a deadly virus and
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
another whether it's not a virus and the
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
pay Must Be The Same by law then I will
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
take the one without the virus
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is precisely why Humanity invented
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
prices so we can appropriately allocate
 
01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.169 align:start position:0%
prices so we can appropriately allocate
resources

01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
if one Health Care Facility has unique
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
dangers then in order to encourage
 
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
nurses to work there they must be paid
 
01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
nurses to work there they must be paid
more

01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
in order for the agencies to get nurses
 
01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:44.219 align:start position:0%
into areas with these conditions they
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
must pay them more
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
it will have to be paid for somehow the
 
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
agencies will have to increase costs
 
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
across the board or somehow otherwise
 
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
obscure pricing from the reality in
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this bill is against free
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
speech and freedom of Association it
 
01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
states that nurse agencies shall not
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
recruit potential employees on the
 
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
premises of a Health Care Facility
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
in order to enforce this totalitarian
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
methods would have to be used to ensure
 
01:22:12.410 --> 01:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
that nurses who are assigned to the
 
01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
facility be put on a gag order as far as
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
the conditions on their employment
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
besides the Free Speech issue how does
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
increasing advertising costs for the
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
agency reduce overall costs
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker in reality labor is a scarce
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
resource this is why it requires the
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
distribution of paychecks in order to
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
obtain it today many Industries are
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
competing for labor
 
01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:35.219 align:start position:0%
the reason for the high labor costs are
 
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
varied and complex it is not as simple
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
as pointing a finger at the nursing
 
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
agencies and blaming them for everything
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then adding arbitrary rules and
 
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
Hoops for them to jump through
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation exists only to make
 
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
people feel good about themselves
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
pretending to be accomplishing something
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
when I came here today I didn't know I
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
was going to be speaking at the well I
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
am a nurse and I'm straight out a night
 
01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:08.890 align:start position:0%
am a nurse and I'm straight out a night
shift

01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:08.900 align:start position:0%
shift
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that this legislation
 
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
would be very detrimental to my
 
01:23:14.699 --> 01:23:16.250 align:start position:0%
would be very detrimental to my
profession

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
profession
 
01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:16.930 align:start position:0%
profession
um

01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:16.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
I would tried to get a hold of the New
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nurses Association but on such
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
a short time because I didn't know that
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
this bill was on the docket today
 
01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't able to get in touch with
 
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
them to find out what their position is
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
but I have
 
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
I have worked as a travel nurse before
 
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and many people you know many of my
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
co-workers have as well
 
01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire can't recruit travel
 
01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:51.140 align:start position:0%
nurses because they're prohibited by the
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislation that might pass today
 
01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:55.430 align:start position:0%
legislation that might pass today
um

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:57.770 --> 01:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
basically the the travel nurses are just
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
going to go to Massachusetts they're
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
going to get higher contracts there and
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
that's going to put New Hampshire
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
nursing is in a desperate place right
 
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
now I can tell you that
 
01:24:08.699 --> 01:24:09.410 align:start position:0%
now I can tell you that
um

01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.850 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know why a lot of people are
 
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:14.460 align:start position:0%
talking right now I'm trying to tell you
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
what I experience in my profession
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
we are desperately understaffed and
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
travel nursing is a Band-Aid to put to
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
get our patients the nurses that they
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
need on such a short time frame but it
 
01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't solve the long-term problem of
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
low Staffing
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
um and when we don't have enough staff
 
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
it's the patients who suffer
 
01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.770 align:start position:0%
it's the patients who suffer
so

01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:42.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's not meant to be like all the time
 
01:24:47.870 --> 01:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
travel nursing because that is very
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
expensive for the hospital but it is
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
meant to be a Band-Aid until they can
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
get more staff and the way to get more
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
staff is to recruit more people into the
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
profession but we actually have a
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
problem with having enough nursing
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
instructors in the college and that's
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
where the stop Gap is so that's a
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
separate that's a separate conversation
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
but I feel like this
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
um legislation is
 
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
is detrimental to my profession and I
 
01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
can't support it thank you
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:30.800 align:start position:0%

facilities as well
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%

it is often the case that at the last
minute

01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%

01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
a staffing commitment from the nursing
 
01:26:09.649 --> 01:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
agency is pulled
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
from a county home and the staff is
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
reassigned to a higher paying facility
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
this has led to an increase of 155
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
percent in nursing costs
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%

speakers uh regarding this bill and I
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
know that we still have a couple weeks
 
01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
before the deadline and that if those
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
concerns were to be addressed in in the
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
next two weeks that we could bring this
 
01:28:59.090 --> 01:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
bill back off the table and deal with it
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that house bill 149
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
addresses a problem that was mentioned
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
by the County nursing homes and other
 
01:29:18.590 --> 01:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
health care facilities in New Hampshire
 
01:29:21.410 --> 01:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
that led to an increase of 155 percent
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
in costs that are brought down to our
 
01:29:27.709 --> 01:29:27.719 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker

this amendment is a bipartisan amendment
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
that was drafted with between myself and
 
01:32:54.490 --> 01:32:54.500 align:start position:0%
my good friend the member from
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
Manchester the vice chair
 
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
sb14 came to the committee with uh some
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
deep concerns for all of us that we
 
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:06.300 align:start position:0%
could agree on that no landowner wants
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
surveillance devices placed on their
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
land without being aware of them that uh
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
no matter how much land you own
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
you should have the right to know that
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
somebody's placing surveillance devices
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
the only place where the committee
 
01:33:21.770 --> 01:33:21.780 align:start position:0%
differed and we couldn't come to terms
 
01:33:24.830 --> 01:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the committee was on how extensive to
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
make that change and in what manner
 
01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:30.540 align:start position:0%
but the vice chair and I got together
 
01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
and crafted an amendment that we are
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
presenting to you now that fixes some
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
problems with it but still supports the
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
ability for the landowners to have the
 
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
Sovereign right of their land without
 
01:33:44.290 --> 01:33:44.300 align:start position:0%
having somebody
 
01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
unknowingly Place game cameras or
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
cameras of any type that can record
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
pictures video sound and Etc
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
I would hope that you can support this
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and press the green button
 
01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:01.679 align:start position:0%

thank you I agree with the premise of
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill but I think there's
 
01:34:15.649 --> 01:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
drafting issues with the amendment and
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
also some issues with the original Bill
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
itself definition the definition of game
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
camera if you take a look at it is so
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
broad it includes dash cameras it
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
includes any surveillance cameras on
 
01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:29.460 align:start position:0%
your house I think people have a right
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
to have a camera on their house pointed
 
01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
at their own property and I think the
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't address that when it
 
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
speaks at 300 feet of permanently
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
occupied dwelling I have neighbors
 
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
within 300 feet of me I don't think I
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
should need their permission to have a
 
01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
camera on my property pointed at my
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
property further any cars that have a
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
dash camera or a century version and
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
there isn't many cars I cannot even
 
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
drive on someone's driveway
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
um just based on definition so while I
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate and I like the
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
premise of the underlying bill I think
 
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
the question is on Amendment 1520 are
 
01:35:16.250 --> 01:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
you ready for the question all those in
 
01:35:18.169 --> 01:35:18.179 align:start position:0%
favor say aye
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
all those opposed nay
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the amendment's
 
01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:26.209 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the amendment's
adopted

01:35:26.209 --> 01:35:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
for what reason does remember rise I
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
moved to table
 
01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative Hines moves to table
 
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 14. I asked for a division
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
vote this will be a division vote
 
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay Senate
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill 14 on the table representative
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
Heinz is recognized for parliamentary
 
01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.729 align:start position:0%
Heinz is recognized for parliamentary
inquiry

01:36:46.729 --> 01:36:46.739 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know the
 
01:36:51.229 --> 01:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
premise of this good bill is good but
 
01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
the language is bad and I think dash
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
cameras should not be illegal and I
 
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
think people deserve to have
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
surveillance cameras on their own
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
property faced at their property when I
 
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
then support the table so this bill
 
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
could be reworked thank you
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%

01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I know this
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment has nothing to do with needing
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
permission to put a camera on your own
 
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.370 align:start position:0%
permission to put a camera on your own
property

01:37:19.370 --> 01:37:19.380 align:start position:0%

01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
then would I press the red button and

01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay Senate
 
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
bill 14 on the table this is a division
 
01:37:33.649 --> 01:37:33.659 align:start position:0%

27-28
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker appreciate that
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to this amendment
 
01:40:34.010 --> 01:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
simply because this amendment does not
 
01:40:38.990 --> 01:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
when this bill was originally introduced
 
01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
it was substantially different than it
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.370 --> 01:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is because the
 
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
body that considered it was quite
 
01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:55.970 align:start position:0%
body that considered it was quite
skeptical

01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
skeptical
 
01:40:59.570 --> 01:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
about the provisions of the bill
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
so they did what they often do they
 
01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment does not address the
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
Bill's original intent
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.490 --> 01:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
our committee sdne considered the
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
language changes in this amendment and
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
decided that they did not address the
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
major concerns with this bill
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
therefore we can't support this
 
01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:33.950 align:start position:0%
therefore we can't support this
amendment

01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:41:37.189 --> 01:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
and we ask you to press the red button
 
01:41:39.169 --> 01:41:39.179 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker I asked for a division
 
01:41:39.179 --> 01:41:43.189 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker I asked for a division
vote

01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:45.530 --> 01:41:45.540 align:start position:0%

01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh first thing I
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
would point out is that the St e
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
committee actually voted in favor of
 
01:41:59.570 --> 01:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment 14-6 uh the amendment is
 
01:42:02.689 --> 01:42:02.699 align:start position:0%
mostly removing a few things but the
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
main thing it does is it removes the
 
01:42:07.609 --> 01:42:07.619 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission from the
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill because it's just premature to have
 
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
the puc involved so therefore I would
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
ask you to support the amendment and
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
simplify this bill so that it can be
 
01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
questions on Amendment 1401 H and this
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
is a division vote members please take
 
01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:38.000 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker I'll simply

reiterate what I said a few moments ago

if I know that this amendment does not
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
make an unnecessary Bill necessary

if I also know that this bill was
 
01:43:58.609 --> 01:43:58.619 align:start position:0%
substantially different when introduced
 
01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:01.260 align:start position:0%
and the study committee that
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
the bill ended up being is not going to
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
address the issues that were brought up
 
01:44:10.129 --> 01:44:10.139 align:start position:0%
by the initial bill when I now press the

committee 14-6 so it had Republican
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
support and if I know that this
 
01:44:30.649 --> 01:44:30.659 align:start position:0%
amendment actually makes the bill more
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
focused would I then press the green
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%

01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 52 establishes a committee
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
to study EV charging infrastructure and
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
its funding
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you all remember when our
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
grandparents in this legislature
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
authorized a committee to study building
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
and funding gas station infrastructure
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.490 --> 01:46:45.500 align:start position:0%
it was necessary so Massachusetts
 
01:46:48.290 --> 01:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
terrorists could drive their new
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
Horseless carriages
 
01:46:52.370 --> 01:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
to our ski resorts
 
01:46:54.530 --> 01:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
otherwise they were all going to go to
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
no that didn't happen
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
but you will be told it's necessary now
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
and that the committee needs to look at
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
the funding sources beyond that coming
 
01:47:12.050 --> 01:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
from EV users
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
Roman meals tax
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
credits from business profits business
 
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
Enterprise and state utility tax taxes
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
and enabling local property tax
 
01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:26.629 align:start position:0%
and enabling local property tax
exemptions

01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
actually our grandparents let the free
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
market create the needed infrastructure
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
of those times
 
01:47:39.649 --> 01:47:39.659 align:start position:0%
and it can do so again
 
01:47:43.129 --> 01:47:43.139 align:start position:0%
with no rate payer and taxpayer
 
01:47:47.450 --> 01:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
Beyond trying to extract money from
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
non-ev users the committee itself is
 
01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.070 align:start position:0%
non-ev users the committee itself is
redundant

01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
01:47:58.729 --> 01:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
in 2018 this legislature passed the New
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Transportation Council it's
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
embedded in RSA 238a
 
01:48:08.209 --> 01:48:08.219 align:start position:0%
it has the authority to quote study
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%

Technologies and modes
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the council's membership was
 
01:48:23.810 --> 01:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
restructured to include the
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
Commissioners from the Department of
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
energy and the Department of
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:48:32.450 --> 01:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
the council has the power to accept
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
gifts and grants
 
01:48:37.609 --> 01:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
have over 21 million dollars of non-rate

projects
 
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
so this bill is both ill-conceived and
 
01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:52.250 align:start position:0%
so this bill is both ill-conceived and
unnecessary

01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
push the red button to itl
 
01:48:59.930 --> 01:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Corman
 
01:49:06.530 --> 01:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker uh so I haven't met everybody
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
I am Tom Corman from ward 3 of the city
 
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
of Lebanon and I stand here before you
 
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
to support SB 52.
 
01:49:22.490 --> 01:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
if we don't build it they won't come
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
the it
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
is fast charging infrastructure for
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles EVS
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
and that they
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
are the tourists that much of New
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy depends on
 
01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
because this bill is really about the
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
future of tourism in New Hampshire
 
01:49:42.649 --> 01:49:42.659 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of tourists
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
from out of state come from nearby
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
States and provinces and they arrive by
 
01:49:49.129 --> 01:49:49.139 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
what kind of motor vehicle will tourists
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
be driving in the not too distant future
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
we are going to see a lot of EVS ISO New
 
01:50:01.209 --> 01:50:01.219 align:start position:0%
England the regional grid operator
 
01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
forecasts more than a 50-fold increase
 
01:50:07.129 --> 01:50:07.139 align:start position:0%
in EVS by 2031.
 
01:50:08.689 --> 01:50:08.699 align:start position:0%
from 35
 
01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
000 to 1.9 million that's just for New
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
England add in the other nearby States
 
01:50:18.770 --> 01:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
and provinces and you get the picture
 
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter how any of us in this
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
chamber feel about EVS
 
01:50:25.129 --> 01:50:25.139 align:start position:0%
the fact is
 
01:50:26.930 --> 01:50:26.940 align:start position:0%
they are coming
 
01:50:29.330 --> 01:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
and we had really better be ready for
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
them because we sure as heck are not
 
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
ready now
 
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has only half as many
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
publicly available charging stations as
 
01:50:40.129 --> 01:50:40.139 align:start position:0%
either Maine or Vermont
 
01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
our state is a desert for fast EV
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
Chargers especially north of Concord and
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's where people go to ski or hike
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
think about a potential visitor with an
 
01:50:52.490 --> 01:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
EV coming from say Southern New England
 
01:50:55.729 --> 01:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
New York New Jersey Quebec Ontario or
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
New Brunswick
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
they will ask I can get to New Hampshire
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
but can I get home
 
01:51:05.390 --> 01:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
if the answer is no then they're not
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
coming here
 
01:51:09.169 --> 01:51:09.179 align:start position:0%
they're going to Vermont or Maine to ski
 
01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
or hike and our tourism industry suffers
 
01:51:13.609 --> 01:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
so ski areas and other tourist
 
01:51:16.609 --> 01:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
attractions lose significant sales as do
 
01:51:18.950 --> 01:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants and lodging to give you an
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
idea of the numbers we're talking about
 
01:51:25.250 --> 01:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
in 2021 New Hampshire welcomed 14.3
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
million visitors who spent 6.3 billion
 
01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
dollars that's with a B which generated
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
328.3 million dollars in tax revenues
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
so we had better be ready this bill SB
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
52 establishes a committee to examine
 
01:51:46.370 --> 01:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
how to fund EV charging infrastructure
 
01:51:48.470 --> 01:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
not so much about the EV Chargers
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
themselves but about how to get the
 
01:51:53.510 --> 01:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
power to where the Chargers are going to
 
01:51:57.729 --> 01:51:57.739 align:start position:0%
be fast Chargers require a lot of power
 
01:52:00.649 --> 01:52:00.659 align:start position:0%
and getting that much power to them is
 
01:52:02.570 --> 01:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
often not possible with the existing
 
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it is not something that
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
we can rely on the market to provide
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
the committee will review existing state
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
and federal funding sources along with
 
01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
existing funding by ratepayers and it
 
01:52:19.010 --> 01:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
will examine additional non-rate payer
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
funding sources
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
this lays out a menu of possible
 
01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
additional sources and yes as my friend
 
01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
from Southampton pointed out some items
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
on the menu are taxes but other possible
 
01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
menu items are fees paid only by EV
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
owners and users and also incentivizing
 
01:52:38.570 --> 01:52:38.580 align:start position:0%
private capital
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
the bill allows the committee to choose
 
01:52:43.370 --> 01:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
items not even on the menu it'll look at
 
01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
how other states do it and the committee
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
will take input from the public and
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
relevant state agencies
 
01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
there is the New Hampshire
 
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation Council and my friend
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
from Southampton did quote the charter
 
01:52:59.629 --> 01:52:59.639 align:start position:0%
of the council correctly study methods
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
of implementing new Transportation
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
Technologies and Mojo's Transportation
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but they're not
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the power infrastructure and
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
how to fund it by contrast this bill SB
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
52 lays out a committee comprising only
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
four members three from this chamber and
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
one from the other side of the wall with
 
01:53:20.330 --> 01:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
the focused goal of suggesting how to
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
fund the infrastructure between the grid
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
and the meter serving the EV Chargers
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
how to come up with the funding isn't
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
returning to what SB 52 is really about
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
imagine what our tourism industry would
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
be like if we had only a handful of gas
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
stations in New Hampshire because that's
 
01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
what it will be like in just a few years
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
if we don't get ready to outfit EV
 
01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
charges our tourism industry would
 
01:53:52.209 --> 01:53:52.219 align:start position:0%
collapse and taxes paid by
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
out-of-staters hey our favorite kind of
 
01:53:57.890 --> 01:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
tax will plummet
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
and so if you want to see those sweet
 
01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
out of state dollars continue to roll in
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
then please press the green button and
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
vote for the OTP motion on this bill and
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
for what reason does a member rise
 
01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker to make an alternate motion
 
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:54:30.890 --> 01:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
I moved to table Senate bill 52.
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
representative Hall moves the Senate
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 52 be laid on the table
 
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
I would ask for a roll call vote and
 
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
request a roll call vote is that
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
01:54:46.189 --> 01:54:46.199 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote members please take
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.890 --> 01:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay a Senate
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 52 on the table this is a roll call
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%

01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
about this committee about something
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
that is going to potentially increase
 
01:56:08.639 --> 01:56:10.490 align:start position:0%
that is going to potentially increase
taxes

01:56:10.490 --> 01:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
for the rate payers if I further know
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
that electric vehicles currently do not
 
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
pay the role excuse me the roll the road
 
01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
toll tax what I now vote Yes to table
 
01:56:26.810 --> 01:56:26.820 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
01:56:35.810 --> 01:56:35.820 align:start position:0%
bill just creates a study committee it
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually raise any rates or any
 
01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
taxes and that it could be crucial to
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
the future of tourism in New Hampshire
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%

01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
that we can vote on the bill itself
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
the questions whether to lay a Senate
 
01:56:54.890 --> 01:56:54.900 align:start position:0%

01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
this is a division vote and we are on
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.649 --> 01:58:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative Vost is recognized for

01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
that studying electric vehicle charging
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
station infrastructure is an ongoing
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
effort at the Department of
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services the Department of
 
01:58:57.070 --> 01:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation and the statutory
 
01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%

Transportation Council
 
01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
if I also know that this bill's study
 
01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
committee duplicates much of this effort
 
01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
and exists primarily to study ways to
 
01:59:11.570 --> 01:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
fund such infrastructure by shifting
 
01:59:14.810 --> 01:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
costs to all taxpayers
 
01:59:17.089 --> 01:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that consumer demand
 
01:59:19.490 --> 01:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
will set the pace for the build out of
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
EV charging stations
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
what I then press the red button to let
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
EV fueling stations evolve in the same
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
way that gasoline fueling stations did
 
01:59:33.709 --> 01:59:33.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:59:35.209 --> 01:59:35.219 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas is
 
01:59:45.530 --> 01:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
is on tourists visiting our state and
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
spending their money on our attractions
 
01:59:54.890 --> 01:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
restaurants and hotels
 
01:59:57.709 --> 01:59:57.719 align:start position:0%
and that the state takes in well over
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
300 million dollars annually from
 
02:00:03.709 --> 02:00:03.719 align:start position:0%
tourists visiting our fabulous
 
02:00:07.490 --> 02:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
attractions like our mountains Santa's
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
Village Storyland and yes whale's Tales
 
02:00:13.850 --> 02:00:13.860 align:start position:0%
and if I know that ISO New England
 
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
predicts that there will be more than a
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
50-fold increase in electric visit
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles just in New Hampshire
 
02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:24.420 align:start position:0%
by 2031
 
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
on top of all of the electric vehicles
 
02:00:29.390 --> 02:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
from States outside of New Hampshire of
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
New England
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
and finally if I also know that New
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is considered a charging
 
02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:35.930 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is considered a charging
desert

02:00:35.930 --> 02:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
desert
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
in New England because we lack the
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to provide for those
 
02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles resulting in those
 
02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
tourists instead visiting other states
 
02:00:48.589 --> 02:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
where they will spend their money
 
02:00:51.050 --> 02:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button so
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
that we can prepare New Hampshire for an
 
02:00:57.050 --> 02:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
electrified vehicle future in order to
 
02:01:00.649 --> 02:01:00.659 align:start position:0%
attract and keep tourist money in our
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion about to
 
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
pass on Senate Bill 52 and this is a
 
02:01:12.350 --> 02:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
division vote if you're in favor press
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%

02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:00.540 align:start position:0%

02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
187 in the affirmative 184 and the
 
02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
for what reason doesn't remember us
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker having voted on the
 
02:02:30.850 --> 02:02:30.860 align:start position:0%
prevailing side I would move
 
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
reconsideration and ask the body to vote
 
02:02:36.490 --> 02:02:36.500 align:start position:0%
no and I requested

02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
sb69 expands net metering by raising the
 
02:05:31.250 --> 02:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
net meter cap from one megawatt to 5
 
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:33.840 align:start position:0%

half thousand non-profits in New
Hampshire

02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
let's do a little back of the napkin
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
math if just two percent of the six and
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
a half thousand non-profits take
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
advantage of the new limit that would be
 
02:05:47.089 --> 02:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
an additional 650 megawatts of
 
02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
intermittent power added to the grid
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire has an estimated
 
02:05:54.189 --> 02:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
400 megawatts of net metered electricity
 
02:05:56.629 --> 02:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill has the potential to
 
02:05:58.010 --> 02:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
more than double the amount of
 
02:05:59.570 --> 02:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
electricity being net metered from
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
unreliable sources
 
02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
so what is wrong with expanding net
 
02:06:06.290 --> 02:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
metering a report commissioned by the
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
published last October found that net
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
metering does cause cost cost shifting
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
whereby regular electric customers end
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
up subsidizing the practice of net
 
02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
metering by a small number of other
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
customers for that reason this
 
02:06:23.450 --> 02:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
legislature has been very careful and
 
02:06:25.729 --> 02:06:25.739 align:start position:0%
deliberate and expanding net metering
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
furthermore two bills we passed last
 
02:06:33.649 --> 02:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
year HP 1599 and SB 261 require the
 
02:06:35.930 --> 02:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission to take up
 
02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
of cost shifting and the puc has taken
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.089 --> 02:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
the other issue that comes up with debt
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
metering expansion is reliability
 
02:06:51.709 --> 02:06:51.719 align:start position:0%
when the utility buys electricity from
 
02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
the wholesale Market those purchases
 
02:06:56.030 --> 02:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
come with contractual obligation to
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
produce power this means the utility can
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
they can be sure that the producer has
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
an incentive to deliver reliable power
 
02:07:06.050 --> 02:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
over the length of the purchase
 
02:07:08.089 --> 02:07:08.099 align:start position:0%
agreement on the other hand when
 
02:07:09.649 --> 02:07:09.659 align:start position:0%
utilities purchase net metered
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
electricity this comes with no
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
contractual obligation when the power is
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually in demand a net metered
 
02:07:17.689 --> 02:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
customer can choose not to sell into the
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
grid and conversely when there is low
 
02:07:21.770 --> 02:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
demand the customer can force the
 
02:07:24.290 --> 02:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
utility to buy
 
02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
utilities cannot depend on net metered
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
electricity to reliably power the grid
 
02:07:31.609 --> 02:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
to avoid blackouts and interruptions in
 
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
power the grid operators have to make
 
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
sure that there's always a backup of
 
02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
reliable power ready to kick in to keep
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
things running
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
for every extra megawatt produced by
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
solar there has to be an equal capacity
 
02:07:47.089 --> 02:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
produced by other more reliable methods
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
in conclusion nothing prevents
 
02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
non-profits or any other individual or
 
02:07:54.050 --> 02:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
business from producing more than one
 
02:07:55.910 --> 02:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt of electricity for their own
 
02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:57.109 align:start position:0%
megawatt of electricity for their own
consumption

02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
they just can't force the utility to buy
 
02:08:02.330 --> 02:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
access at the premium price this bill
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
would force utilities to buy more
 
02:08:06.050 --> 02:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
unreliable electricity at the premium
 
02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:07.850 align:start position:0%
unreliable electricity at the premium
price

02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:07.860 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire Department of energy does
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
not support this bill and New Hampshire
 
02:08:13.609 --> 02:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate also does not support
 
02:08:16.010 --> 02:08:16.020 align:start position:0%

I rise today in support of the motion of
 
02:08:36.830 --> 02:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
OTB for SB 69.
 
02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
this bill will enable not mandate New
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire non-profits who are able and
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
wish to invest in projects themselves to
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
obtain the full benefits of net metering
 
02:08:50.209 --> 02:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
on projects up to five megawatts in size
 
02:08:52.609 --> 02:08:52.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is currently the one state
 
02:08:55.310 --> 02:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
in our region that arbitrarily limits
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
the size of these projects to one
 
02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.310 align:start position:0%
the size of these projects to one
megawatt

02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
megawatt
 
02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
it will also give smaller non-profits
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to collaborate and share
 
02:09:05.149 --> 02:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
both the cost of investing in these
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
projects and the returns from them
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nonprofits are an
 
02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:12.780 align:start position:0%
important part of our state's economy in
 
02:09:16.070 --> 02:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
2019 they employed over 83 000 Granite
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
Staters which is 15 percent of our total
 
02:09:21.649 --> 02:09:21.659 align:start position:0%
Workforce and accounted for 13.5 percent
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
of our state's annual gross domestic
 
02:09:24.119 --> 02:09:25.729 align:start position:0%
of our state's annual gross domestic
product

02:09:25.729 --> 02:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
product
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nonprofits bring people
 
02:09:29.209 --> 02:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
together to shape and improve the
 
02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
quality of lives in our community
 
02:09:34.609 --> 02:09:34.619 align:start position:0%
in 2019 over 329
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
000 Granite Staters volunteered at one
 
02:09:39.649 --> 02:09:39.659 align:start position:0%
or more of our non-profits they are an
 
02:09:40.850 --> 02:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
important part of the New Hampshire
 
02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:42.229 align:start position:0%
important part of the New Hampshire
advantage

02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
every dollar a non-profit can save makes
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
a difference whether they can continue
 
02:09:49.609 --> 02:09:49.619 align:start position:0%
to deliver the services to many of our
 
02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
family families friends and Neighbors
 
02:09:55.609 --> 02:09:55.619 align:start position:0%
whenever possible we should do whatever
 
02:09:58.250 --> 02:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
we can to support and assist them
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
One Way new nonprofits can save money is
 
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
to invest in renewable energy the most
 
02:10:05.930 --> 02:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
popular example being solar panels
 
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
once panels are installed the cost of
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
every kilowatt hour generated and used
 
02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
is negligible in addition as you already
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
heard under existing law any individual
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
or organization who chooses to invest in
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects can also
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
receive a credit for any power they
 
02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
generate but do not use and are able to
 
02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:29.099 align:start position:0%
sell back to the utility that is what is
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
referred to as net metering
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
you will hear as you already have that
 
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
because net metering that that because
 
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
this net metering mechanism already
 
02:10:43.010 --> 02:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
exists this bill is unnecessary
 
02:10:46.669 --> 02:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
however under existing law non-profits
 
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
are only able to reap the full benefits
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
of net metering on projects up to one
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
megawatt they invest in themselves
 
02:10:55.250 --> 02:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
this creates a challenge for most
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
non-profits because The Upfront
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
investment costs of most renewable
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
energy projects are typically too high
 
02:11:04.729 --> 02:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
for most of them to afford on their own
 
02:11:07.669 --> 02:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
in addition the optimal size to generate
 
02:11:09.770 --> 02:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
the greatest return on investment for
 
02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
most projects is in the three plus
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
megawatt range
 
02:11:16.129 --> 02:11:16.139 align:start position:0%
the additional revenue from net metering
 
02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
this bill will provide to non-profits
 
02:11:20.810 --> 02:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
will reduce the payback period on these
 
02:11:23.570 --> 02:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
Investments improving the attractiveness
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
of investing in them and providing
 
02:11:27.169 --> 02:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
non-profits with an important cost
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
saving opportunity
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
it will also help to reduce our regions
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
over a Reliance on natural gas which is
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
what drove up an electricity prices this
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
past winter and places us at further
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
risk in the future
 
02:11:42.169 --> 02:11:42.179 align:start position:0%
now much has been said about the alleged
 
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
cost shifting that some suggest occurs
 
02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
from net metering this is an idea that
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
most of us without solar panels will end
 
02:11:53.209 --> 02:11:53.219 align:start position:0%
up paying more for electricity than
 
02:11:55.550 --> 02:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
those with solar panels
 
02:11:58.129 --> 02:11:58.139 align:start position:0%
Skeptics of net metering have correctly
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
observed that when our utilities
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
purchase unused power back from their
 
02:12:05.209 --> 02:12:05.219 align:start position:0%
customers they end up paying more for
 
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
that energy than if they were they
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
purchased it from the wholesale Market
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
exactly how significant a difference
 
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
that is depends on the the vagaries of
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
the of the energy Market
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
however many of these Skeptics usually
 
02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:20.510 align:start position:0%
however many of these Skeptics usually
admit

02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
admit
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that net metered projects also
 
02:12:26.089 --> 02:12:26.099 align:start position:0%
result in significant benefits to all
 
02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
rate payers
 
02:12:29.330 --> 02:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
from the power grids perspective
 
02:12:31.609 --> 02:12:31.619 align:start position:0%
generating your own power and using it
 
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
locally is exactly the same as reducing
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
demand it reduces The Strain on the
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
regional transmission system and frees
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
up capacity on the grid to move more
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
bulk power to where it's needed most
 
02:12:46.729 --> 02:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
utilities see the benefit of this effect
 
02:12:49.129 --> 02:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
in the form of lower Regional transition
 
02:12:52.609 --> 02:12:52.619 align:start position:0%
transmission and capacity payments and
 
02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
those savings are passed on to all of us
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
the question however has always been
 
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
what is the cost benefit ratio how much
 
02:13:01.850 --> 02:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
are the costs and how much are the
 
02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:03.050 align:start position:0%
are the costs and how much are the
benefits

02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
we finally got an answer that question
 
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
this past fall
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of energy
 
02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
hired a team of independent Consultants
 
02:13:13.729 --> 02:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
to use the best available data to try to
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
answer the question of whether the cost
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
of net metering outweighed the benefits
 
02:13:20.450 --> 02:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
the results of that study showed that
 
02:13:23.089 --> 02:13:23.099 align:start position:0%
while at some point in the future we may
 
02:13:25.609 --> 02:13:25.619 align:start position:0%
start to see some sort of cost shift
 
02:13:28.250 --> 02:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
that day is far off
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
we can leave our existing net metering
 
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
rates in place for 10 more years and
 
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
only then might we see a one percent
 
02:13:38.209 --> 02:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
increase in rates
 
02:13:40.910 --> 02:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
but that same study also found that
 
02:13:43.010 --> 02:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
while rates may rise the average
 
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
electricity bill
 
02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
granted Staters pay will go down because
 
02:13:50.629 --> 02:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
net metering encourages local people to
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
invest in local generation and receive
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
the benefit of that investment in the
 
02:13:57.290 --> 02:13:57.300 align:start position:0%
form of lower monthly costs on their
 
02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:58.569 align:start position:0%
form of lower monthly costs on their
bill

02:13:58.569 --> 02:13:58.579 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
sb69 is an important bill not only for
 
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
the many non-profits and their employees
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
who do so much good work across our
 
02:14:09.530 --> 02:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
state but for all granted Staters the
 
02:14:12.050 --> 02:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
one thing everyone here can agree on is
 
02:14:14.089 --> 02:14:14.099 align:start position:0%
that we need to address the rising price
 
02:14:16.370 --> 02:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
of electricity that is impacting our
 
02:14:16.380 --> 02:14:17.930 align:start position:0%
of electricity that is impacting our
constituents

02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
02:14:20.750 --> 02:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we all are united I think in the
 
02:14:23.330 --> 02:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
notion that we should be we should be
 
02:14:26.330 --> 02:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
energy independent and no longer rely on
 
02:14:28.370 --> 02:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
foreign sources of energy
 
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
SP 69 is a very small proposal for how
 
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
we might start to do that it will
 
02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
encourage investment in local power
 
02:14:39.890 --> 02:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
generation at a scale that makes sense
 
02:14:42.709 --> 02:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
for our non-profits and it will lower
 
02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
operating costs for this important
 
02:14:47.089 --> 02:14:47.099 align:start position:0%
segment of our economy which will end up
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
benefiting all of us
 
02:14:51.649 --> 02:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
I urge you all to vote ought to pass on
 
02:14:54.830 --> 02:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
SB 69 and Mr Speaker I ask for a

speaker
 
02:16:45.770 --> 02:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that New Hampshire
 
02:16:48.530 --> 02:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
is one megawatt limit on net metering is
 
02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
not arbitrary
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
but is in fact a guard rail to protect
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
our state's rate payers
 
02:16:58.190 --> 02:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that our state's
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate who serves to protect
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
the interests of our state race rate
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
payers opposes an expansion of net
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
metering Beyond one megawatt
 
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
if I also know that expanding net
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
meeting metering to as many as
 
02:17:17.770 --> 02:17:17.780 align:start position:0%
6500 non-profit groups could
 
02:17:20.750 --> 02:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
substantially increase electricity costs
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
because net metered power has a lower
 
02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
value than the reliable power delivered
 
02:17:27.889 --> 02:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
by utilities
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that the
 
02:17:32.089 --> 02:17:32.099 align:start position:0%
department of energy advises that policy
 
02:17:34.129 --> 02:17:34.139 align:start position:0%
makers should wait until the conclusion
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
of the public utility commission's
 
02:17:38.509 --> 02:17:38.519 align:start position:0%
current proceeding about net metering
 
02:17:40.490 --> 02:17:40.500 align:start position:0%

02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
but I now press the red button to
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
preserve a guard rail that protects all
 
02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%

02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
if I know that New Hampshire's
 
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
non-profits contribute substantially to
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
the well-being of New Hampshire citizens
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the one megawatt
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
limit for net metering was put in place
 
02:18:13.490 --> 02:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
because we heard that we needed to wait
 
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
to understand its impacts on New
 
02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:16.730 align:start position:0%
to understand its impacts on New
Hampshire

Hampshire
 
02:18:19.129 --> 02:18:19.139 align:start position:0%
and if I know as my colleague just
 
02:18:21.290 --> 02:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
explained that those impacts were stated
 
02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
to be very minor or positive
 
02:18:25.849 --> 02:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that this bill
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
would allow our non-profits to make the
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
choice to save money without causing or
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%

02:23:45.530 --> 02:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
02:23:47.210 --> 02:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
unlike the last bill there's no limits
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
on who can participate in net metering
 
02:23:53.929 --> 02:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
on this other than the limits that the
 
02:23:56.270 --> 02:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
market causes because of size and
 
02:23:58.610 --> 02:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
dollars in other words any large
 
02:24:00.590 --> 02:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
corporation no matter how big they are
 
02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
will be subsidized by the rate payers to
 
02:24:05.510 --> 02:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
put in net metering if this bill passes
 
02:24:09.050 --> 02:24:09.060 align:start position:0%
it takes acres and acres to put in a
 
02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
five megawatt system or at least 20
 
02:24:13.010 --> 02:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
acres and hundreds of thousands of
 
02:24:15.410 --> 02:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
dollars the overwhelming majority of
 
02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
businesses in New Hampshire don't have
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
the room and or the money to do this so
 
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
we're talking about large corporations
 
02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
like Stony field yogurt who testified in
 
02:24:25.130 --> 02:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill because they want to
 
02:24:27.530 --> 02:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
see their electric bill go down at the
 
02:24:30.530 --> 02:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
expense of the rate payers
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
as it was said in the last bill the
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
consumer advocate of New Hampshire does
 
02:24:36.530 --> 02:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
not endorse any expansion of net
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
metering over one megawatt because he
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
realizes it causes a subsidy by the rate
 
02:24:43.849 --> 02:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
payers and rates will go up if this bill
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
passes the previous speaker on the other
 
02:24:48.650 --> 02:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
bill which applies to this well mentions
 
02:24:51.170 --> 02:24:51.180 align:start position:0%
studies the doe study but that was based
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
on one megawatt cap not a five megawatt
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference there and
 
02:24:57.830 --> 02:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's a potential for hundreds and
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of megawatts to come on the
 
02:25:02.270 --> 02:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
market and again just as in the last one
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
none of these megawatts would have an
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide any electricity at
 
02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
any time that's the difference when the
 
02:25:11.210 --> 02:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
utilities sign a contract for default
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
Energy Service they could go to a
 
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
supplier and the obligation is 24 7 for
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
the length of that contract you will
 
02:25:20.990 --> 02:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
supply all the electricity we need or
 
02:25:23.090 --> 02:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
our customers need regardless of whether
 
02:25:24.889 --> 02:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
it's hotter than normal colder than
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
normal drier than normal or wetter than
 
02:25:26.880 --> 02:25:27.950 align:start position:0%
normal drier than normal or wetter than
normal

02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
normal
 
02:25:30.889 --> 02:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
net metering has no provision they
 
02:25:32.690 --> 02:25:32.700 align:start position:0%
produce electricity when it's convenient
 
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
for them to do so if they have a problem
 
02:25:36.710 --> 02:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
with their inverters let's say for a few
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
days they may fix them they may not
 
02:25:40.969 --> 02:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty for not providing
 
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
electricity but whenever they do provide
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
it the utility must buy it so on a
 
02:25:49.130 --> 02:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
Sunday around 11 or 12 o'clock in May 65
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
degrees there's no air conditioning load
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
the company's not using any electricity
 
02:25:54.349 --> 02:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
to speak of because they're shut down
 
02:25:56.929 --> 02:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
it's a Sunday and there's Surplus
 
02:25:59.090 --> 02:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
electricity but the utility has to buy
 
02:26:01.849 --> 02:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
it and has to pay them the default
 
02:26:04.250 --> 02:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
service rate and give us put some
 
02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
specifics on this this past January
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
which everyone was panicking about huge
 
02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
High rates and everything the default
 
02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
service rate was 20 cents a kill about
 
02:26:14.690 --> 02:26:14.700 align:start position:0%
20 cents 20 cents a kilowatt hour
 
02:26:18.290 --> 02:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
the average LMP or market-based price
 
02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
for electricity in New England for the
 
02:26:23.090 --> 02:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
month of January was five cents that's
 
02:26:25.130 --> 02:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
the difference five cents selling it
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
into the market default service rate was
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
20 cents because the default service
 
02:26:31.190 --> 02:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
rate comes with that guarantee that I
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
will give you all the electricity you
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
need whenever you need it the person
 
02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
selling net metering electricity has no
 
02:26:41.210 --> 02:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide anything anytime
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
there's also the cost about people
 
02:26:45.590 --> 02:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned about how it adds value to the
 
02:26:47.570 --> 02:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
system but the problem is without the
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
obligation to provide electricity when
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's needed they provide no reliability
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
basis whatsoever so in December and
 
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
January on cloudy days on snowy days
 
02:27:01.010 --> 02:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
these metering not only will they not be
 
02:27:02.929 --> 02:27:02.939 align:start position:0%
putting electricity on the grid they'll
 
02:27:04.969 --> 02:27:04.979 align:start position:0%
be consuming electricity because they
 
02:27:06.650 --> 02:27:06.660 align:start position:0%
won't be producing enough to cover their
 
02:27:09.050 --> 02:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
own load because solar panels almost go
 
02:27:10.730 --> 02:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
to zero when you're talking about the
 
02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
dark days of December and January
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
especially if it's snowing out or
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
raining so those times though the Grid
 
02:27:20.450 --> 02:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
in the system has to be built to make
 
02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
sure we can supply all the customers all
 
02:27:24.770 --> 02:27:24.780 align:start position:0%
the electricity they need whether
 
02:27:26.690 --> 02:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
they're producing solar power in net
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
metering or whether they're consuming it
 
02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
so the reliability value of these
 
02:27:33.770 --> 02:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
projects is almost zero it you can't say
 
02:27:36.530 --> 02:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
I'll be there in June between the hours
 
02:27:39.410 --> 02:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
of 11 and 4 and maybe you will it's
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
provided it's not a cloudy day like
 
02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
today and it's raining out and you want
 
02:27:46.010 --> 02:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
your power whenever you decide you have
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
to have it that's the problem there's no
 
02:27:50.570 --> 02:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
obligation to be there it simply isn't
 
02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
worth the saying I use a simple analogy
 
02:27:55.130 --> 02:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
to hopefully get my point across and
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
that's with milk
 
02:27:58.969 --> 02:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
if you have milk coming out of the cow
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
that has a value but the milk you buy in
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
the supermarket in a container has a lot
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
more value it's both milk it's both the
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
same product but one's been taken out
 
02:28:10.610 --> 02:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't and things been done to it
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
the other one's been past your eyes and
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
add vitamin D to it and it's been put in
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
containers it's been shipped a couple of
 
02:28:16.849 --> 02:28:16.859 align:start position:0%
times and it shows up at your
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
Supermarket the value of the milk and
 
02:28:20.809 --> 02:28:20.819 align:start position:0%
the gallon container or the half gallon
 
02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:22.620 align:start position:0%
container you buy in the supermarket is
 
02:28:24.770 --> 02:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
much higher than that same gallon of
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
milk coming out of the cow the same
 
02:28:29.150 --> 02:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
thing applies here the value of the
 
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
electricity coming out of that net
 
02:28:33.050 --> 02:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
metering generator is much much lower
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
than the value of the default service
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
that comes to your house for your
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
utility one has an obligation to show up
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
all the time you want to turn on your TV
 
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
turn on more lights it's there the other
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
one maybe I'm there maybe I'm not when
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
it works for me oh I'm going to be
 
02:28:49.250 --> 02:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
working I'm going to be putting on a
 
02:28:51.830 --> 02:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
little extra workload on a very hot day
 
02:28:54.710 --> 02:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
in in July when electric demand is very
 
02:28:56.270 --> 02:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
high so I just don't put anything out on
 
02:28:58.250 --> 02:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
to fall my net metering because I'm
 
02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:00.300 align:start position:0%
consuming all my electricity another
 
02:29:02.090 --> 02:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
time well I'm going to do the same thing
 
02:29:04.370 --> 02:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
in January but I don't have any default
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
any electricity to put out because of
 
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
net metering so now I'm going to consume
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of electricity so it's not
 
02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
reliable it's simply not the same
 
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
product and it guarantees to raise
 
02:29:16.370 --> 02:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
electric rates if this bill passes so
 
02:29:20.090 --> 02:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:29:37.490 --> 02:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
morning colleagues I rise in favor of SB
 
02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:40.910 align:start position:0%
morning colleagues I rise in favor of SB
79

02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
as you've often heard and as you just
 
02:29:46.210 --> 02:29:46.220 align:start position:0%
heard from my colleague from Stratford
 
02:29:49.490 --> 02:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
opposition to net metering and expanding
 
02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
net metering has always been based on
 
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
this dogged insistence that paying the
 
02:29:58.849 --> 02:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
Retail Energy only rate for those net
 
02:30:01.790 --> 02:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
metered kilowatt hours is a big subsidy
 
02:30:05.389 --> 02:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
that paying uh it's an overpayment that
 
02:30:08.090 --> 02:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
must then be covered recovered from
 
02:30:10.490 --> 02:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
other rate payers so that it's this
 
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
giant cost shift from the many
 
02:30:15.889 --> 02:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
like seniors and single moms and small
 
02:30:18.889 --> 02:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
businesses to the relatively few who are
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
so several years ago this legislature
 
02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:25.010 align:start position:0%
so several years ago this legislature
directed

02:30:25.010 --> 02:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
directed
 
02:30:27.050 --> 02:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
and our own Department of energy
 
02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
conducted or at least they contracted
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
for and they oversaw a study which you
 
02:30:34.490 --> 02:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
heard my colleague from Hampton on the
 
02:30:36.530 --> 02:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
earlier Bill described
 
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
they did a big study of net metering and
 
02:30:41.270 --> 02:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
a big analysis of real-time energy
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
supply and demand and cost modeling
 
02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
that my colleague from Stratford was
 
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
referring to how the system works
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
and they to settle the question about
 
02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
the value of net metering and that study
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
took several years to complete we all
 
02:30:59.330 --> 02:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
waited several years and it was
 
02:31:00.770 --> 02:31:00.780 align:start position:0%
completed last November it was called
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
the value of distributed energy
 
02:31:04.490 --> 02:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
resources study so it must have been
 
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
really thorough it took several years
 
02:31:06.600 --> 02:31:08.030 align:start position:0%
really thorough it took several years
uh

02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
and the bottom line that you heard my
 
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
colleague from Hampton talk about was
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
it a big there's no big giant cost shift
 
02:31:17.929 --> 02:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
at most under the most conservative
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
assumptions about the way the grid
 
02:31:21.889 --> 02:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
operates and real-time Energy prices and
 
02:31:24.050 --> 02:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
all that at most
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
a one percent cost shift
 
02:31:29.809 --> 02:31:29.819 align:start position:0%
one percent that's one penny on one
 
02:31:29.819 --> 02:31:33.410 align:start position:0%
one percent that's one penny on one
dollar

02:31:33.410 --> 02:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.389 --> 02:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
so in fact the value of distributed
 
02:31:37.849 --> 02:31:37.859 align:start position:0%
energy resources study found that net
 
02:31:39.889 --> 02:31:39.899 align:start position:0%
metered energy
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
is worth the retail price because it
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
goes directly onto the grid
 
02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
directly onto the grid supplying the
 
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
next closest neighbor avoiding all
 
02:31:53.570 --> 02:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
long-distance transmission costs and
 
02:31:56.929 --> 02:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
virtually all local distribution costs
 
02:31:59.450 --> 02:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
the New England's independent system
 
02:32:01.250 --> 02:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
operator testified to the science
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
technology and energy committee in
 
02:32:06.590 --> 02:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
January that in the aggregate all the
 
02:32:09.230 --> 02:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
net metered solar installations in the
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
region substantially reduce Regional
 
02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
demand and thus lower the market
 
02:32:17.530 --> 02:32:17.540 align:start position:0%
clearing energy price for All customers
 
02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
and also reducing long distance
 
02:32:22.370 --> 02:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
transmission costs
 
02:32:24.950 --> 02:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
our distribution utilities across the
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
state eversource Unitil Liberty the
 
02:32:29.210 --> 02:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
co-op they all recognize that net
 
02:32:32.090 --> 02:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
metered energies so Energy Systems
 
02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
reduce their default Supply requirements
 
02:32:39.050 --> 02:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
again lowering costs for all
 
02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
now in conclusion I want to share with
 
02:32:44.210 --> 02:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
you a real world example of the harm
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
that our
 
02:32:48.770 --> 02:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
arbitrary limitation on the scale
 
02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
of net metered solar arrays is doing to
 
02:32:54.530 --> 02:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire businesses this bill
 
02:32:58.010 --> 02:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
in particular would raise the arbitrary
 
02:33:02.030 --> 02:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
cap from one megawatts to five megawatts
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
and of course Industries and businesses
 
02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
are institutions that use large amounts
 
02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
02:33:11.590 --> 02:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
and they provide large numbers of jobs
 
02:33:14.750 --> 02:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
and bring produce large amounts of tax
 
02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:15.889 align:start position:0%
and bring produce large amounts of tax
revenue

02:33:15.889 --> 02:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:33:18.410 --> 02:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
for our state
 
02:33:20.510 --> 02:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
not far from here just across the river
 
02:33:22.130 --> 02:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
down in Pembroke
 
02:33:25.849 --> 02:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
the associated Grocers of New England
 
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
operates an enormous refrigerated
 
02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:29.270 align:start position:0%
operates an enormous refrigerated
Warehouse

02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
Warehouse
 
02:33:31.370 --> 02:33:31.380 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago they put up a one
 
02:33:34.130 --> 02:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar array on their roof
 
02:33:36.530 --> 02:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
because that's the largest that they're
 
02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to build
 
02:33:42.050 --> 02:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
and to interconnect to the grid
 
02:33:44.090 --> 02:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
can't interconnect anything more than
 
02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
that array produces only about 20
 
02:33:54.590 --> 02:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
percent of all the energy that that
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
enormous refrigerated Warehouse uses
 
02:34:00.889 --> 02:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
and they actually have a whole lot more
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
roof space that sits there empty
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
and unused
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
even though filling it with solar would
 
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
help them reduce their costs
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
immensely so the result of that is that
 
02:34:19.610 --> 02:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
their energy costs are much higher than
 
02:34:21.410 --> 02:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
02:34:23.389 --> 02:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
and that means that the prices that
 
02:34:24.530 --> 02:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
their members
 
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
all those small town Grocers across our
 
02:34:30.710 --> 02:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
state have to charge for their food
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
are higher than they need to be
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
and those are the prices that our
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
constituents pay
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
so at this time when we've all been
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
harshly reminded about how vulnerable
 
02:34:45.230 --> 02:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses and residents
 
02:34:46.910 --> 02:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
are to the whims of the global energy
 
02:34:49.610 --> 02:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
Market we in this body should be doing
 
02:34:51.889 --> 02:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
everything we can
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
to remove barriers to private investment
 
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
give our businesses another tool in
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
their toolbox to help reduce their own
 
02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.610 align:start position:0%
their toolbox to help reduce their own
costs

02:35:01.610 --> 02:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
while diversifying our state's energy
 
02:35:03.720 --> 02:35:05.270 align:start position:0%
while diversifying our state's energy
Supply

02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
and creating local jobs and supporting
 
02:35:10.429 --> 02:35:10.439 align:start position:0%
local economies in the process and yes
 
02:35:13.130 --> 02:35:13.140 align:start position:0%
reducing costs for all
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
so please vote Yes on ought to pass on
 
02:35:21.490 --> 02:35:21.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:23.809 --> 02:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
was requested a roll call is that
 
02:35:26.929 --> 02:35:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:29.150 --> 02:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
02:35:47.330 --> 02:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:47.340 --> 02:36:42.889 align:start position:0%

the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
02:36:48.349 --> 02:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 79. this is going to be a
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
roll call vote
 
02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative voice
 
02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:07.910 --> 02:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:37:10.610 --> 02:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the study
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
referenced several times here in the
 
02:37:14.210 --> 02:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
last few minutes
 
02:37:17.929 --> 02:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
did indeed find that cost shifts of 1 to
 
02:37:21.889 --> 02:37:21.899 align:start position:0%
2.9 percent happen today
 
02:37:24.170 --> 02:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
and that other studies show that these
 
02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
percentages go up
 
02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that any business in
 
02:37:33.770 --> 02:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
our state can build and benefit from
 
02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
from up to five megawatts of solar power
 
02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:38.330 align:start position:0%
from up to five megawatts of solar power
today

02:37:38.330 --> 02:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
law does not prevent anyone from
 
02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
connecting more than one megawatt of
 
02:37:45.770 --> 02:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
power it simply prevents you from
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
collecting net metering subsidies over
 
02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
if I also know that fixed income seniors
 
02:37:57.410 --> 02:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
and single moms and hard-working Granite
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
Staters should not be obligated to help
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
a private for-profit profit business
 
02:38:07.250 --> 02:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
earn a better return on its Investments
 
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that our state's
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
Governor said of net metering expansion
 
02:38:14.809 --> 02:38:14.819 align:start position:0%
just last year and I quote
 
02:38:17.929 --> 02:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
I vetoed these crazy ideas before and if
 
02:38:20.030 --> 02:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
they come back in the future I'll veto
 
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
them again unquote
 
02:38:25.250 --> 02:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
what I now press the red button to spare
 
02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
the chair recognized representative
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.710 --> 02:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
I know that raising nutmeguring to five
 
02:38:49.130 --> 02:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
megawatts will result in load reduction
 
02:38:52.490 --> 02:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
across the grid lower capacity payments
 
02:38:55.490 --> 02:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
and avoided transmission costs all to
 
02:38:57.770 --> 02:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
the benefit of rate payers
 
02:38:59.330 --> 02:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
and further
 
02:39:02.030 --> 02:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that current technology makes
 
02:39:03.889 --> 02:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
the installation of one megawatt system
 
02:39:07.370 --> 02:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
often economically unviable
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
an image piece of five megawatts
 
02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:12.120 align:start position:0%
will allow the installer the economy
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
economies of scale necessary to go
 
02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:15.110 align:start position:0%
economies of scale necessary to go
forward

02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:39:16.969 --> 02:39:16.979 align:start position:0%
and last
 
02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
knowing that the Business Industrial
 
02:39:21.590 --> 02:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire supports
 
02:39:25.250 --> 02:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
this legislation because like myself the
 
02:39:27.530 --> 02:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
Bia knows that this bill is a jobs
 
02:39:29.090 --> 02:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
creation bill
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
it will allow New Hampshire business to
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
allot their resources to retain
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce rather than ship our valuable
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
energy dollars out of state
 
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button
 
02:39:42.950 --> 02:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
knowing that I've done my part to reduce
 
02:39:45.170 --> 02:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
energy costs and support our New
 
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy thank you
 
02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
motion before us is ought to pass on
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 79 it's a roll call vote if
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're in favor you'll press the green
 
02:39:55.130 --> 02:39:55.140 align:start position:0%

hydrogen energy and infrastructure
 
02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
have been considered the same report the
 
02:41:41.410 --> 02:41:41.420 align:start position:0%
same with the following resolution
 
02:41:43.490 --> 02:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
resolved that it's inexpedient to
 
02:41:45.650 --> 02:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
legislate representative Doug Thomas for
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee
 
02:41:50.270 --> 02:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having
 
02:41:52.010 --> 02:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
considered the same and being unable to

agree with the majority Report with a
 
02:41:55.130 --> 02:41:55.140 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the bill ought to pass
 
02:41:57.590 --> 02:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Tony Kaplan for the minority of
 
02:42:00.170 --> 02:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:02.270 --> 02:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues I Rise to speak against the
 
02:42:15.349 --> 02:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate motion on
 
02:42:17.809 --> 02:42:17.819 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 167.
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
a bill to incentivize a green hydrogen
 
02:42:22.849 --> 02:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
industry in New Hampshire
 
02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
you may have heard of fomo fear of
 
02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
missing out I've heard of it because I
 
02:42:29.450 --> 02:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
am the father of three children in their
 
02:42:31.309 --> 02:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
teens and early 20s who talk about it as
 
02:42:33.050 --> 02:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
one of the stressors in their young
 
02:42:33.060 --> 02:42:34.190 align:start position:0%
one of the stressors in their young
lives

02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
lives
 
02:42:37.130 --> 02:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
I tell them I have full low fear of
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
losing out
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
because I see New Hampshire late to the
 
02:42:42.650 --> 02:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
starting gate on the energy transition
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of undertaking as
 
02:42:47.929 --> 02:42:47.939 align:start position:0%
a region and a nation
 
02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is a bipartisan attempt to
 
02:42:52.190 --> 02:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
catch us up with our neighbors in terms
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the production of clean hydrogen seen
 
02:42:56.570 --> 02:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
as one of the pillars of the transition
 
02:42:59.450 --> 02:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
and energy that I just mentioned
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
let me briefly explain what clean
 
02:43:03.710 --> 02:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is and why it's going to be an
 
02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
important energy source and why we need
 
02:43:07.849 --> 02:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:43:10.130 --> 02:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is widely available it's a
 
02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
plentiful element on our planet it's the
 
02:43:16.370 --> 02:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
H in H2O water and the H and CH4 or
 
02:43:16.380 --> 02:43:18.590 align:start position:0%
H in H2O water and the H and CH4 or
methane

02:43:18.590 --> 02:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
methane
 
02:43:20.990 --> 02:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is useful because it contains a
 
02:43:23.389 --> 02:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
lot of very available energy it's much
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
more energy dense than gasoline for
 
02:43:28.610 --> 02:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
example but it takes a lot of energy to
 
02:43:30.830 --> 02:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
produce or split it apart from either
 
02:43:33.650 --> 02:43:33.660 align:start position:0%
water or methane the two main sources
 
02:43:36.410 --> 02:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
for current hydrogen production
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend
 
02:43:41.630 --> 02:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
the member has a right to be heard if
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
you have to have a conversation take it
 
02:43:46.910 --> 02:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
out into the ante room please
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
remember me continue
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker most hydrogen
 
02:43:53.570 --> 02:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
produced today is used in oil refineries
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
as part of the refinery process or in
 
02:43:58.010 --> 02:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
the production of fertilizers produce
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
produced mainly from natural gas or
 
02:44:03.170 --> 02:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
methane in a process known as Steam
 
02:44:05.450 --> 02:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
reformulation which involves heating the
 
02:44:06.950 --> 02:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas
 
02:44:09.170 --> 02:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
it's a very carbon polluting process
 
02:44:11.090 --> 02:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
producing about 10 tons of carbon
 
02:44:13.969 --> 02:44:13.979 align:start position:0%
emissions for every ton of hydrogen so
 
02:44:15.710 --> 02:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
not helpful if you're concerned about
 
02:44:19.010 --> 02:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
saving the climate from carbon pollution
 
02:44:21.050 --> 02:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
the other way of producing hydrogen
 
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
splitting water molecules with
 
02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:25.620 align:start position:0%
electricity gets us closer to clean or
 
02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen depending on the source
 
02:44:30.650 --> 02:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
of the electricity if you use renewable
 
02:44:32.750 --> 02:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
electricity from wind or solar or
 
02:44:34.670 --> 02:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
nuclear electricity you get clean
 
02:44:37.070 --> 02:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
hydrogen or green hydrogen splitting the
 
02:44:39.530 --> 02:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
H off the O in the water with no carbon
 
02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:40.550 align:start position:0%
H off the O in the water with no carbon
emissions

02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
emissions
 
02:44:42.410 --> 02:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
and when you burn that hydrogen you've
 
02:44:44.270 --> 02:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
produced as a fuel you also get no
 
02:44:47.809 --> 02:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
carbon emissions you just get water
 
02:44:50.210 --> 02:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
so it's an ideal fuel when produced from
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
Green Renewables or zero carbon nuclear
 
02:44:54.650 --> 02:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
energy it's light you can store it
 
02:44:57.170 --> 02:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
relatively easily and transport it as a
 
02:45:00.530 --> 02:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
gas or in compressed form as a liquid
 
02:45:02.809 --> 02:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
so clean or green hydrogen is a small
 
02:45:04.849 --> 02:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
but fast growing area of the transition
 
02:45:07.610 --> 02:45:07.620 align:start position:0%
from fossil based carbon fuels to clean
 
02:45:10.250 --> 02:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
energy sources that we have committed to
 
02:45:11.929 --> 02:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
in order to avoid the worst case
 
02:45:14.570 --> 02:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
scenarios of climate change
 
02:45:17.450 --> 02:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
and green hydrogen is forecast to play a
 
02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
central wall in decarbonizing heavy
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
Industries such as steel and chemicals
 
02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
and for large trucks and airplanes where
 
02:45:27.530 --> 02:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
batteries are just too heavy to make an
 
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle practical
 
02:45:32.570 --> 02:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's also ideal for storing wind and
 
02:45:34.550 --> 02:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
solar power used to produce it
 
02:45:37.010 --> 02:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
transforming an intermittent unreliable
 
02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
source of energy into a dispatchable
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
turn on or off of the switch grid ready
 
02:45:44.410 --> 02:45:44.420 align:start position:0%
source of electricity when used in a
 
02:45:47.210 --> 02:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
hydrogen-powered Generating Station thus
 
02:45:48.889 --> 02:45:48.899 align:start position:0%
helping to solve the problem of
 
02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
intermittency in an electricity grid
 
02:45:53.270 --> 02:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
with a large percentage of Renewables
 
02:45:56.030 --> 02:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
which is what we're aiming for
 
02:45:58.610 --> 02:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
the International Energy agency says
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
total hydrogen production will need to
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
be around 180 million metric tons by
 
02:46:05.929 --> 02:46:05.939 align:start position:0%
2030 from just over 90 million tons
 
02:46:08.809 --> 02:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
today to reach our climate goals
 
02:46:10.910 --> 02:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
green production of the gas is less than
 
02:46:12.770 --> 02:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
one percent of the current total
 
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
production it would need to rise to more
 
02:46:17.690 --> 02:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
than 90 million tons by 2030. in other
 
02:46:19.370 --> 02:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
words in just seven years we need to
 
02:46:21.410 --> 02:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
double our production of hydrogen and
 
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
half of that would have to be clean or
 
02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen it's a huge job but it's
 
02:46:28.250 --> 02:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
well underway the infrastructure
 
02:46:31.490 --> 02:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
investment and jobs Act of 2021 includes
 
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
eight billion dollars in Grants for
 
02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
clean hydrogen projects the inflation
 
02:46:39.410 --> 02:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
reduction act includes more tax credits
 
02:46:41.450 --> 02:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
production and investment credits for
 
02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
clean hydrogen production so there's
 
02:46:45.170 --> 02:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
lots of money out there to jump start
 
02:46:47.990 --> 02:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
this essential industry in effect this
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
is a wartime mobilization or something
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
akin to a wartime mobilization of
 
02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
resources to accomplish an existential
 
02:46:58.370 --> 02:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
task for our country
 
02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
Seven States including our neighbors
 
02:47:02.929 --> 02:47:02.939 align:start position:0%
Maine Massachusetts Vermont Connecticut
 
02:47:05.929 --> 02:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
and Rhode Island have formed the New
 
02:47:08.929 --> 02:47:08.939 align:start position:0%
England clean hydrogen Hub that includes
 
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
besides those seven states a hundred
 
02:47:12.650 --> 02:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
partner institutions including power
 
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
companies utilities manufacturers
 
02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:16.849 align:start position:0%
companies utilities manufacturers
universities

02:47:16.849 --> 02:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
universities
 
02:47:19.849 --> 02:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
Etc all focused on aligning the
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
integration of Renewables such as
 
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
onshore and offshore wind hydropower and
 
02:47:27.349 --> 02:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
solar and nuclear power into clean
 
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
hydrogen production and the evaluation
 
02:47:31.429 --> 02:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
of clean hydrogen for use in
 
02:47:33.050 --> 02:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
transportation including medium and
 
02:47:35.630 --> 02:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
heavy duty trucks heavy industry and
 
02:47:38.690 --> 02:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
power generation applications
 
02:47:40.910 --> 02:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not one of those States
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
currently mobilizing to be a part of
 
02:47:45.710 --> 02:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
this what promises to be the engine of
 
02:47:48.770 --> 02:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
the 21st century Regional economy
 
02:47:52.070 --> 02:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
this bill SB 167 is an attempt to catch
 
02:47:53.750 --> 02:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
the green hydrogen terrain before it
 
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
leaves the station
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
02:48:00.050 --> 02:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would make a bid for some
 
02:48:02.090 --> 02:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
of these projects by establishing a five
 
02:48:03.650 --> 02:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar credit against
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax for a single
 
02:48:08.210 --> 02:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
project for a maximum of 10 green
 
02:48:10.849 --> 02:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
hydrogen projects a year
 
02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's a good sweetener for the
 
02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
establishment of infrastructure and Jobs
 
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
worth billions over the lifetime of
 
02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
these projects
 
02:48:20.929 --> 02:48:20.939 align:start position:0%
the bill would establish an advisory
 
02:48:22.490 --> 02:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
committee tasked with identifying
 
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
barriers and streamlining the permitting
 
02:48:25.020 --> 02:48:26.330 align:start position:0%
barriers and streamlining the permitting
process

02:48:26.330 --> 02:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
the committee would also identify
 
02:48:29.210 --> 02:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
opportunities to integrate green
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
hydrogen in transportation energy
 
02:48:33.710 --> 02:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
industrial and other sectors and would
 
02:48:36.590 --> 02:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
also be tasked with partnering with any
 
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
hydrogen hubs in the region thus joining
 
02:48:41.690 --> 02:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
with our fellow States in New England to
 
02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
build a better future for ourselves
 
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting for somebody else to
 
02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
do the heavy lifting
 
02:48:49.610 --> 02:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
in short guiding and incentivizing a
 
02:48:51.410 --> 02:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
green hydrogen industry in our state and
 
02:48:53.330 --> 02:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
region to meet not only our energy
 
02:48:56.330 --> 02:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
diversity needs but Economic Development
 
02:48:58.309 --> 02:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
long-term goals to ensure our way of
 
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
life for years to come
 
02:49:02.690 --> 02:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
so if you're like me and you're a secret
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
folo sufferer or even worse if you're
 
02:49:07.610 --> 02:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
upset at New Hampshire's neutral stance
 
02:49:10.250 --> 02:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
in the face of a nationwide mobilization
 
02:49:12.650 --> 02:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
to transform our Energy System to ensure
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
a livable planet you want to make sure
 
02:49:18.410 --> 02:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
we overturn this itl to show that New
 
02:49:19.969 --> 02:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is ready to be a part of the
 
02:49:21.770 --> 02:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
clean energy transition
 
02:49:24.110 --> 02:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
vote red so that a better motion can be
 
02:49:28.490 --> 02:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:35.210 --> 02:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:37.790 --> 02:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:49:41.570 --> 02:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
well my my colleague has given a very
 
02:49:44.510 --> 02:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
good speech regarding hydrogen
 
02:49:47.389 --> 02:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
a very technical speech but this bill is
 
02:49:50.290 --> 02:49:50.300 align:start position:0%
not really about hydrogen it's about
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
establishing another committee out of
 
02:49:55.429 --> 02:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
our 400 plus business committees we
 
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
already have
 
02:49:59.150 --> 02:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
that will most not only have government
 
02:50:01.610 --> 02:50:01.620 align:start position:0%
interference before the free market even
 
02:50:04.010 --> 02:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
gets a foot on the ground
 
02:50:06.290 --> 02:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
that's our primary opposition to this
 
02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:07.849 align:start position:0%
that's our primary opposition to this
bill

02:50:07.849 --> 02:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:50:10.730 --> 02:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
this bill presumes that an advisory
 
02:50:13.610 --> 02:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
committee is needed to establish tax
 
02:50:15.889 --> 02:50:15.899 align:start position:0%
credits and other government regulations
 
02:50:18.530 --> 02:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
before the market even comes into New
 
02:50:18.540 --> 02:50:20.929 align:start position:0%
before the market even comes into New
Hampshire

02:50:20.929 --> 02:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.710 --> 02:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
as far as we know there's only one
 
02:50:26.030 --> 02:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturer made a recent Public
 
02:50:29.330 --> 02:50:29.340 align:start position:0%
Announcement about producing hydrogen
 
02:50:31.309 --> 02:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
and they flatly said they don't need
 
02:50:32.330 --> 02:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:50:35.690 --> 02:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
that's a sign that the free market works
 
02:50:39.050 --> 02:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
this bill having an advisory committee
 
02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
would talk about things about
 
02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
establishing tax credits regulations
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
and for a market that was was mentioned
 
02:50:50.270 --> 02:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
previously New Hampshire didn't even bid
 
02:50:54.290 --> 02:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
on a hub for hydrogen markets because we
 
02:50:56.150 --> 02:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
have none here yet
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
we believe that the free market should
 
02:51:02.809 --> 02:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
dictate when and where such action is
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
necessary and right now we don't see a
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
lot of hydrogen coming into this state
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
by the way the term green hydrogen was
 
02:51:13.070 --> 02:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
used and that's the term that would be
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
used for this advisory committee to be
 
02:51:18.050 --> 02:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
studying but just as an aside I won't go
 
02:51:19.849 --> 02:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
into it but there are other there are
 
02:51:22.490 --> 02:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
other forms of manufacture hydrogen but
 
02:51:24.290 --> 02:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
they all mean the same thing hydrogen is
 
02:51:26.210 --> 02:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
hydrogen you might hear the term blue
 
02:51:27.950 --> 02:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
hydrogen that's manufactured using
 
02:51:30.170 --> 02:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
natural gas is a term called yellow
 
02:51:33.230 --> 02:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
hydrogen used by manufacturing solar by
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
solar only
 
02:51:37.309 --> 02:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
believe it or not there's pink hydrogen
 
02:51:40.309 --> 02:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
used manufactured by nuclear power only
 
02:51:42.889 --> 02:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
and then the dreaded gray hydrogen which
 
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
is manufactured by oil and coal so this
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
advisory committee would be studying
 
02:51:50.330 --> 02:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
just the use of green hydrogen
 
02:51:54.889 --> 02:51:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
in view of the fact that we don't have a
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
large Market coming in here yet uh
 
02:52:03.290 --> 02:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
the tax credits that they would be
 
02:52:05.570 --> 02:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
studying would be placed upon the
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy and they have said
 
02:52:10.730 --> 02:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
that they're not a tax agency so I'm not
 
02:52:12.050 --> 02:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
sure if that's going to be well placed
 
02:52:14.690 --> 02:52:14.700 align:start position:0%
if the if they study that
 
02:52:16.750 --> 02:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
I would say there's one more thing too
 
02:52:19.610 --> 02:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
we like hydrogen we think it's going to
 
02:52:21.889 --> 02:52:21.899 align:start position:0%
be good but there are some concerns yet
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
still that were having been completely
 
02:52:27.170 --> 02:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
studied yet and I will say that one
 
02:52:31.670 --> 02:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
member of our majority that voted that
 
02:52:36.590 --> 02:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
voted itl there's a concern that um
 
02:52:39.050 --> 02:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
that there's a potential impact of
 
02:52:40.969 --> 02:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
hydrogen leaks getting into our
 
02:52:43.849 --> 02:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
atmosphere all I'll say on that is that
 
02:52:46.730 --> 02:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
a recent article from Reuters cites four
 
02:52:49.730 --> 02:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
reports that suggest more data is needed
 
02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
to learn the full effects of leaking
 
02:52:53.990 --> 02:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
hydrogen and what can be tolerated
 
02:52:58.250 --> 02:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
before it negates its energy advantage
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we're ready yet this
 
02:53:03.110 --> 02:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill is not ready for prime time we
 
02:53:04.910 --> 02:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't need government interference let
 
02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
the free market work when it comes for
 
02:53:08.570 --> 02:53:08.580 align:start position:0%
those reasons
 
02:53:10.550 --> 02:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
we ask you vote in excreting to
 
02:53:13.849 --> 02:53:13.859 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:54:51.530 --> 02:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that hydrogen is
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
currently happening in New Hampshire in
 
02:54:55.370 --> 02:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
Groveton we have an initial inaugural
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
pilot project and that more is coming
 
02:55:01.130 --> 02:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
and further Mr Speaker if I know that
 
02:55:03.290 --> 02:55:03.300 align:start position:0%
hydrogen is incredibly incentivized
 
02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
right now by the federal government and
 
02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
there is plenty of opportunity in New
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for things like nuclear to be
 
02:55:12.230 --> 02:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
converted misery board within the
 
02:55:14.690 --> 02:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
department of energy that has the
 
02:55:16.969 --> 02:55:16.979 align:start position:0%
support of the Department of energy to
 
02:55:19.910 --> 02:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
look at hydrogen would I then plus the
 
02:55:22.610 --> 02:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
red button in order to overturn the itl
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
motion so a better motion may be made
 
02:55:26.450 --> 02:55:26.460 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:55:36.650 --> 02:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that energy from
 
02:55:39.950 --> 02:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
hydrogen has commercial potential
 
02:55:42.950 --> 02:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
but currently there are no businesses in
 
02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently making or using
 
02:55:47.570 --> 02:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
it commercially
 
02:55:49.370 --> 02:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that this bill sets
 
02:55:51.610 --> 02:55:51.620 align:start position:0%
up a committee to study
 
02:55:55.730 --> 02:55:55.740 align:start position:0%

regulation always turns out to be too
 
02:56:12.050 --> 02:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
little too late
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%

some months ago

and the body on the other side of the
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
wall is not uh enthusiastic about it and
 
03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
in order to drive home the fact that we
 
03:02:28.190 --> 03:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
03:02:31.130 --> 03:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
we should repeal the ban on brass
 
03:02:34.010 --> 03:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
knuckles blackjacks and slung shots I
 
03:02:36.889 --> 03:02:36.899 align:start position:0%

defeating this harmful and unnecessary
 
03:03:30.060 --> 03:03:31.610 align:start position:0%
defeating this harmful and unnecessary
Amendment

03:03:31.610 --> 03:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:03:34.190 --> 03:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
what blackjacks and brass knuckles have
 
03:03:36.170 --> 03:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
to do with a bill on tree stands and
 
03:03:37.750 --> 03:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
hunting blinds
 
03:03:40.370 --> 03:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
is something that I'll leave for the the
 
03:03:42.349 --> 03:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
other representative to fill you in on
 
03:03:42.359 --> 03:03:43.269 align:start position:0%
other representative to fill you in on
later

03:03:43.269 --> 03:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:03:45.530 --> 03:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is that this
 
03:03:47.150 --> 03:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
amendment would end our state's current
 
03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
prohibition on carrying or possessing
 
03:03:52.969 --> 03:03:52.979 align:start position:0%
with intent to sell blackjacks brass
 
03:03:55.969 --> 03:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
knuckles and slung shots
 
03:03:58.370 --> 03:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
greater availability of these weapons
 
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
would be one more thing
 
03:04:01.969 --> 03:04:01.979 align:start position:0%
that jeopardizes the safety of our
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
schools our streets our bars our public
 
03:04:08.510 --> 03:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
gathering places and our law enforcement
 
03:04:08.520 --> 03:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
gathering places and our law enforcement
officers

03:04:10.309 --> 03:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
officers
 
03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
when this measure came through as a
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
separate bill in the house it's worth
 
03:04:16.969 --> 03:04:16.979 align:start position:0%
noting that neither the state police nor
 
03:04:19.370 --> 03:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
the chiefs of Police Association weighed
 
03:04:20.570 --> 03:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
in on it
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
but when that bill came before the other
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
body it's important to note that both
 
03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
opposed it
 
03:04:30.170 --> 03:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
so please join our law enforcement
 
03:04:33.410 --> 03:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
community in opposing this unnecessary
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
and harmful change to a good bill that
 
03:04:39.309 --> 03:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
was on consent for a very good reason
 
03:04:44.450 --> 03:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:46.910 --> 03:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
