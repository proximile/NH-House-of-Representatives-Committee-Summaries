we normally do
 
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
um i am
 
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 align:start position:0%

microphone system is different
 
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh i request that you keep the red
 
00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
button which is
 
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
speaker on all the time
 
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 align:start position:0%

up your sound that way we won't have
 
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
feedback we don't need to worry about
 
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
other things this is a different setup
 
00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
because we are in the finance room which
 
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
is where
 
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
the big boys as i might say meet with

these bills made it into the calendar

some did not um it's my understanding
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
that there might have been a little uh
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
glitch between the logging system that
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
staff uses in the calendar
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
able to proceed with our business but
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%

voting
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
the problem i have here is in the state
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
is non-residents that are voting out of
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
our colleges um on election day
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
they're becoming red that means you're a
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
resident of new hampshire
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
and that you should be getting in
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
i know one of my sons that were in maine
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh they called them many times there to
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
go and vote in maine they offer them
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
pizza deliver him to the polls and bring
 
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
him back but he already did absentee
 
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.590 align:start position:0%
him back but he already did absentee
ballot

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
um you know for new hampshire when he
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
was in maine
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
so my
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
mentality on this thing here is to make
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
sure that the students that want to
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
become residents of new hampshire
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
that they're protected
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
and they do not have to pay out of state
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
tuition there because the schools are
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
working hand in hand uh with the
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
students and with other groups here to
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
get them out to vote
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
um there is a gentleman who is going to
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
be testifying at bill durham bill hall
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
from durham
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
who called in he's about 80 years old
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
but he's
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure he
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
knows how to use the computer on this
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
here so hopefully they'll be able to
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
testify on what's going on at the
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire with this
 
00:11:04.959 --> 00:11:06.069 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire with this
voting

00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
voting
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
the second part of this bill is also
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
since i sat on the committee on the
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
affidavits in the voter id years ago
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
the uh one of the mistakes we made was
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
putting in college ids
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
into the law
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
okay to be shown at the polls
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion college ideas should
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
not be used because they're non-resident
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
their families are taking tax breaks you
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
know while they're in college just like
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
i do with all five of my children
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
because they went to school out of state
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
and i know this is a 15 minute and i'm
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
going to cut it shot right there so you
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
can move on and do your business uh
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%

similar law to the bill you're proposing
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's too many uh and
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
most states uh don't let your
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
non-residents vote in your state
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh so i don't have those numbers but i
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
know when i sat on election law you you
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
all probably know better than i do uh
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
you know they're we're one of the very
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
few that allow students that are
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
does this mean that people who come into
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
and want in-state tuition
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
would would uh qualify for in-state
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
tuition right away they just simply say
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
that they're a new hampshire resident
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
right now i think the requirement is six
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
months of residency before or a year
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps i'm not exactly sure perhaps you
 
00:12:59.190 --> 00:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
know or for the speaker down the line
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
we'll know but but is that what that
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
this means
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
what this means in my opinion is that
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
if you're a student you come into the
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
state and you go to college and you are
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
voting in our state you are saying that
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
you're a resident of new hampshire that
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
you plan on staying here our law already
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
says but then i think it's 60 days
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
you're required to get a driver's
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
license that's already in law
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
so all this is is tightening up our law
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
is telling these students in in the
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
colleges that if you're helping and you
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
know these students to go vote
 
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.790 align:start position:0%
know these students to go vote
then

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
you're helping them become residents and
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
we thank you for that then you should be
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
paying in-state tuition
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions for
 
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you very much
 
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.949 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you very much
um

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
we have a number of people signed up on
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
bills today
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
um testimony is going to be limited to
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
accommodate everybody on all bills
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh i will tell you on this bill we have
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
18 signed up in support
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
457 opposed
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
and 10 people signed up to testify
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
um testimony is going to be limited to
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
i've asked my vice chair to time it at a
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
minute and a half that will end up being
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
in about two minutes
 
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
most of these people said zero one or
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
two minutes and that's sort of
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout the morning so
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's where we're gonna go for
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
testimony so i'm gonna go through the
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
list of people who has signed up
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:54.710 align:start position:0%

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
online
up

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
is deborah nelson did i just pass over
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
miss nelson you are with us if you
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
unmute uh we'll be happy to hear for you
 
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
from you excuse me go ahead thank you
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
very much my name is deborah nelson as
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know and i'm a resident of the town
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
of hanover which has a significant
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
college population
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
think it's unfortunate that the issue of
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition is cluttering up access
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
to the polls
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
because we have students who pay taxes
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
they rent they
 
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
contribute enormously
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
to the businesses in the town they serve
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
as volunteers with
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
local school recreation programs they
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
serve on hotlines for suicide
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
concerns they are active and involved in
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
our community
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
they are not seeking any particular
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
break in tuition and as a former public
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
school teacher
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
who taught civics and american history
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
for 27 years i think it's critical that
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
we do all we can to ensure
 
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.509 align:start position:0%
we do all we can to ensure
everyone

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
everyone has access to voting and i
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it's at all inconsistent
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
that students who are living here for
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
four years have the ability should they
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
wish it to vote in this state
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for giving me this time
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
i'm mindful that you don't want people
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
to go on and on but again i'm a resident
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
of hanover a voter in hanover and a
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
complete supporter of access to voting
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
and again i think intuition
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition is a completely
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
different piece of an issue and it just
 
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
certainly does not apply to dartmouth
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
college thank you
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you ms nelson any
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
questions for ms nelson
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
representative barry
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes mrs nelson um especially part
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
about the college id
 
00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.270 align:start position:0%
about the college id
um

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
if these students are contributing as
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
much as you say they are and i have no
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
doubt that they are why shouldn't we
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
give them in-state tuition if they're
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
residents of this state and they're
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
contributing in their tax paying why
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
should they be denied the same benefit
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
that all other residents are
 
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.190 align:start position:0%
that all other residents are
afforded

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
afforded
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
oh i'm not speaking to that i i don't
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
disagree or or have a particular opinion
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
about that my experience is primarily
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
with students at dartmouth college where
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's simply not an issue whether they
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
are afforded in-state tuition i would
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
think that that is a discussion though
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
for a i assume a different committee
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
that is looking at
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh sununu's plan to combine all the
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
in-state colleges the community colleges
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
tuition seems more appropriate to be in
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
this is as far as i'm concerned about
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
access to voting it's about
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
being patriotic it's about doing our
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
civic duty it's about being consistent
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
with what educators
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
try to encourage which is
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
students voting and knowing that that's
 
00:18:27.909 --> 00:18:27.919 align:start position:0%
an important civic duty i'm sorry i just
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
realized my video wasn't on and so i've
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%

moffett uh merrimack 9 loudon canterbury
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
i am a member of the subcommittee
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
legislative subcommittee looking at the
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
usnh cscc snh merger uh very briefly uh
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
hb 429 is an important measure that
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
shines a light where it needs to be
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
shined if college students have bona
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
fide new hampshire residents
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
voting for new hampshire candidates and
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire propositions that that
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
affect our state and communities and
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
they should be treated as new hampshire
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
voting residents and given in-state
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
tuition otherwise it seems like we're
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
fleecing these voting residents by
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
charging them out of state tuition
 
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
conversely if they are if they are bona
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
fide out of staters then
 
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
as evidenced by their tuition status
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
that we need to look at at that as well
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
whether they should be voting in new
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire elections or not i'm sure
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's something that's come up in this
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee in the past so anyway i just
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to pass this
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
measure and get it to the house floor
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
so that the light can be shine on the
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
discussion of fuller discussion may be
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
held in a wider venue
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and then we look at doing the
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
right thing for
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire voters getting new
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire in state tuition
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%

um the question was asked earlier to the
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and he wasn't sure i don't
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
know if you might have more data as to
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
what other states
 
00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:31.110 align:start position:0%

still
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
for tuition purposes considered to be
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any numbers on what other
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
states allow college students to uh to
 
00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:44.230 align:start position:0%
states allow college students to uh to
vote

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%

00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
point or question i'm sure it's fairly
 
00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:53.430 align:start position:0%

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thanks for coming
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
over i guess if you say coming over to
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
the committee this morning on zoom
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony also signed
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
up to speak this morning was tom cronin
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
mr cronin
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh should be with us as a panelist and
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
mr cronin if you unmute good morning
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair members of the
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
committee my name is tom cronin i'm the
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
director of government relations for the
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
university system thank you for having
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
us in this morning to speak with you on
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
this bill so the university system is
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to house bill 429 because of the
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
impact it will have on the cost of
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
public higher education for new
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire students and families there's
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
been some conversation about
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
in-state out-of-state tuition so quite
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
simply the legislature has granted the
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
board of trustees the authority to set
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
policy and determine eligibility for
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition rates at its most basic
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
our rules require two things one that a
 
00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:00.789 align:start position:0%
our rules require two things one that a
student

00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
or his or her family physically reside
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
in the state for at least 12 consecutive
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
months and two they have to reside in
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for some purpose other
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
than obtaining an education so you
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
cannot just enroll at a us 10 age school
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
move to the state and basically after
 
00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
your freshman year apply for in-state
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
tuition you have to be here for some
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
purpose other than obtaining an
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
education and it's quite difficult
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
once you've started to sort of convince
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
the trustees in the policy makers that
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
you are here for anything other than
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
tuition if you've already started at the
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
university um a couple years ago a
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
similar bill to this one was introduced
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
in the state senate uh using the similar
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
this bill didn't ask us for a fiscal
 
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
note using the similar calculations as
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
we had done uh in 2019 uh the usnh
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
estimate is this would cost about 100 or
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
would be about 170 million dollar annual
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
loss in revenue to the system
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
and in response the system would be
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
forced to raise tuition and probably
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
reduce financial aid offerings um both
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
of which would have the results of
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
increasing cost of attendance for new
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire students
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i'd certainly also point out the
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition differential the the
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
fact that new hampshire residents do
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
receive an in-state rate is funded by
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
new hampshire taxpayers so to the degree
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
that uh we got rid of essentially any
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
barrier to receiving in-state tuition uh
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars would then be
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
distributed uh much more broadly i'll
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
stop there and would be happy to take
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cronin questions for mr
 
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.310 align:start position:0%
thank you mr cronin questions for mr
cronin

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
cronin
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
i have a question about
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
out-of-state students who are
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
the children of
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
professors at the university system of
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire do they receive new
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire in-state tuition rates or do
 
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.950 align:start position:0%
hampshire in-state tuition rates or do
they

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
pay out-of-state tuition rates
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh i would want to confirm this
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative but my understanding
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
would be if they are not new hampshire
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
residents they would uh still pay out of
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
state rates there is a
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
tuition discount for faculty and staff
 
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
so they would pay a discount on the out
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
of state rate not a discount on the
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
in-state rate representative barry
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
why is the university system advocating
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
to treat these new hampshire residents
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
that are attempting to put
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
roots down here why are we treating them
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
differently than all other new
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
hampshires why are they not the same
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
sure uh thanks representative i
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question as i said in the
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
testimony essentially
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
the the legislature has given the board
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
the authority to create uh in-state
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
out-of-state policies determine
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
eligibility there are two requirements
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
you have to physically reside in the
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
state for 12 months and you have to

00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:58.950 align:start position:0%
 
hi

00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
my name is emily winfrey and i'm
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
testifying today as a resident of
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
newmarket as well as a student of the
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire while i do
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
agree that granting in-state tuition
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
status to registered voters would
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
greatly incentivize voter registration
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
as well as civic participation i believe
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
that the amendment set forth in hb 429
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
and 432 would exclude and penalize
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
students who like to live in campus
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
dormitories as part of their college
 
00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:22.789 align:start position:0%
dormitories as part of their college
experience

00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
first year housing programs are designed
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
to ease new students into independent
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
living as well as establish a sense of
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
community and access to student
 
00:26:29.039 --> 00:26:30.149 align:start position:0%
community and access to student
resources

00:26:30.149 --> 00:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
as an out-of-state student from michigan
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
these programs were essential for my
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
educational experience at unh as i was
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
far removed from any existing support
 
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.470 align:start position:0%
far removed from any existing support
system

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
i chose to reside and stay in
 
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.789 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
[Music]

00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
but students like me would be forced to
 
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
choose between educational community
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
experience and civic participation in
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
your state of residence considering 96
 
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
of first-year students live in on-campus
 
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
of first-year students live in on-campus
housing

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
at unh this bill would greatly restrict
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
voter participation of university
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
students like myself
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
i do believe that the difficulty of
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
obtaining in-state tuition for
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
legitimate changes in residency needs to
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
be addressed as even living in new
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire for
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
really the entirety of my college
 
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.510 align:start position:0%
really the entirety of my college
experience

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
i was still ineligible for in-state
 
00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:16.470 align:start position:0%
i was still ineligible for in-state
tuition

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
i'd feel that these changes proposed
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
would do little in actuality to increase
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for joining us ms
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
winfrey does anybody have any questions
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
for miss winfrey
 
00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative prudhomme o'brien
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
thank you ms winfrey for your your
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
time and your testimony today
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
do you believe that it was easier for
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
you to vote in new hampshire than it
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
would be for you to vote absentee
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
in michigan from michigan where you are
 
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.549 align:start position:0%
in michigan from michigan where you are
from

00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
well even so i think it would have
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
probably been
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
as easy to get an absentee ballot but my
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
intention is and was to reside in new
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire um and with that being said i
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
would have liked to voted in new
 
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.110 align:start position:0%
would have liked to voted in new
hampshire

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
being a resident
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%

yes all right uh you're with us
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
apparently already so

thank you for joining us and we're as
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know we're doing about a minute and
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
a half so unmute and we're all
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
set okay good to be back um
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh and i did submit some written
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
testimony um representative paul disarro
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned his son who went to school in
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
maine i was in a similar position back
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
very long time ago with my father served
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and i
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
when i was going to school in new york
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
state at clemson university i actually
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh did vote absentee because my dad was
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
on the ballot later i then went to grad
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
school at usc in los angeles and my dad
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
doing other things with lifestyle and i
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
actually immediately
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
registered and um
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
people of my polling place were glad to
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
see students come in so this is uh you
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
know people actually live in college
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
communities are actually happy to see
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
the students vote um the big problem is
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
i guess i have some written testimony
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't have to skip over some of it
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
and take more than a minute to read it
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
but first of all as mr tom cronin noted
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
this would throw the chaos of the
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
university into into uh
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
financing diversity into chaos you know
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
they should be encouraged to vote but
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
paying him
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
this should be a fifteen thousand dollar
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
a year uh incentive for
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
any students u.s citizen
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
who's not who hasn't been living new
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire to vote and that's a huge
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
incentive it's probably illegal too but
 
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
it was certainly for the chaos of
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
university into
 
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.470 align:start position:0%
university into
uh

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
and then um into chaos and then the
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
board of trustees would have to prove
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
all these applications there probably
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
would be hundreds of them i'd probably
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
like almost every student's u.s citizen
 
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
would probably go that's a pretty sweet
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
deal just filling out a performance and
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
saving you know six thousand dollars
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
over four years um
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's also unfair to students who can't
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
register because they're under 18
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
because they're non-citizens and some of
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
those non-citizen students are in fact
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
residents of america qualify for the
 
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
so-called state tuition
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
unfair to students should communic
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
commute to uh
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
usnh or ccnh institutions from other
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
states the unh is one of several which
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
is actually located near a state line
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
and it actually is visa
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative horgan if you could
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
finish up that would be great and we do
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
have your written testimony as you
 
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out and you very conveniently
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
sent it as an attachment which was
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
actually very nice so thank you
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
pdf attached whichever i recommend to
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
everyone very nice
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
i have trouble with doc attachment but
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
anyway so this is uh
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is this is just a ridiculous bill
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
and certainly um
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh probably illegal and certainly
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
just a terrible idea and it's also
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
unfair as i mentioned people who
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
go to a private school or
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
choose not to go to school you know if
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
you want to pay young people sixty
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year
 
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
move here that's that's fine that was
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
way outside the scope of what this
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
committee does and that's probably like
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
cost of that is unimaginable so anyways
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
this is a bad bill and i also uh all
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative horgan
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
legally right here in new hampshire
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the months since the election there
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
have been no substantiated cases of
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
widespread voter fraud in any of new
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire's 10 counties and yet
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
lawmakers in this state use lies of
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
voter fraud to advance legislation that
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
aims to limit eligible voters
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to vote this
 
00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
rhetoric shows discord spreads
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
misinformation and can even incite
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
violence as we witnessed at the capitol
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
on january 6th in revoking our
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to vote you are
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
signaling to college students that we
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
are not welcome in the state you are
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
failing to defend the most fundamental
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
right in democracy the right to vote you
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
are failing to serve your constituents
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
college students across the state demand
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
to have their voices heard once again
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
you are failing to listen as college
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
students in new hampshire we live in new
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire many of us work jobs pay taxes
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
and rent houses in this state we are
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
valued and contributing members of our
 
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
communities and all we ask is that you
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
give us the opportunity to make our
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
voices heard i believe that every
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
student in new hampshire deserves the
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
right to vote and i hope you'll consider
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
what house bill 362 will mean for
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
thousands of college students who are
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
eager to engage in the political process
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
i i am terribly sorry mr brown i was a
 
00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
little confused by your testimony we're
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
actually on 4 29.
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
oh i'm so sorry chairwoman uh i think
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
that we've had a couple of people
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
testify as to
 
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.190 align:start position:0%
testify as to
362

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
362
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
and we're hearing those comments and i
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
understand that that was the bill you
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
were talking about but i'm glad you
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
finally said it because you're not the
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
first speaker that we've had this
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
morning that i think has been saying
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
that one of the ways to track the
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
hearings for this committee and other
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%

you won mute you join us thank you
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of

committee david scanlan deputy secretary
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
of state and i just quickly wanted to
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
make a comment on the voter id portion
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
when voters go to obtain their ballot
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
they are already registered to vote
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
their qualifications have already been
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
proven to the supervisors of the
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
checklist and their name is on the
 
00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:28.710 align:start position:0%
checklist and their name is on the
checklist

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of the voter id law when
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
obtaining a ballot is simply to be able
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
to identify that voter using the photo
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
on the id
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
to the individual whose name is on the
 
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.109 align:start position:0%
to the individual whose name is on the
checklist

00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
so by removing
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
college and school ids
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
as an acceptable form of id for that
 
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.069 align:start position:0%
as an acceptable form of id for that
purpose

00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
the net result is going to be that
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have qualified voters
 
00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
going into the polling place that may
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
have no other
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
id on them in the college towns
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
and those individuals will end up
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
filling out
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh a challenge voter affidavit
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh and submitting that in lieu of just
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
simply showing a college id so i just
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that clarification madam
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
chair and i would be happy to answer any
 
00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:14.630 align:start position:0%
chair and i would be happy to answer any
questions

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
any questions for deputy scanlon
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative prudhommer brian thank
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
could they still use
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
these uh ids to
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
register to vote at their town hall
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
prior to the election i know my daughter
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
recently did that
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change any of the
 
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.670 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change any of the
requirements

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
to show proof of uh identity when
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
registering to vote so
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
if and i would have to look through the
 
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
statute but if
 
00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:50.079 align:start position:0%
using a college id
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
as proof of identity to register is
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%

a little behind on
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of the bills this morning relate
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
to the same things we saw how confusing

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of written
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh input on the bills that we're hearing
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%

00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
actually received the most
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
um on this bill
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
on these bills this morning rather than
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%

26 people signed up to testify on this
bill

00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
if you have submitted written testimony
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask that you refer to that
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
because i know a lot of you have
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
um we have received it
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
and we are going to be holding you to
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
about a minute and a half um most of the
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
people signing up for this have put down
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
a minute we're two minutes um so there
 
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
are a few five minutes and uh frankly i
 
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.870 align:start position:0%
are a few five minutes and uh frankly i
don't

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
see that that is going to be
 
00:42:23.599 --> 00:42:24.630 align:start position:0%
see that that is going to be
um

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
possible in regards to this so
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh this is house bill
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
362. relative to the domicile of
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
students for voting purposes
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this bill is
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative silver
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
and he joins us and representative
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
silver if you can unmute i believe
 
00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
we said was my i was trying
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
there you are good morning thank you
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you madam chair i'm
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative norman silber from
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
belknap county district two towns of
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
guilford and meredith
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
this is dealing with some housekeeping
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh on rsa 654.1 there is a subdivision
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
that specifically denominates that a
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
student of any institution of learning
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
may lawfully claim domicile for voting
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
purposes in new hampshire
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
in which they live while attending such
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
institution if domicile otherwise meets
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the prior section
 
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.230 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the prior section
basically

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm seeking to repeal that section for
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
the following reasons
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
one of the basic one of the essential
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
principles of american law
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
is that we are all equal before the law
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
the equal protection of the law is a
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
very important principle in american law
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
and whenever we create a special class
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
of people a special favored class of
 
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.150 align:start position:0%
of people a special favored class of
individuals

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
it diminishes the rights of others i
 
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
believe representative barry on a prior
 
00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.230 align:start position:0%
believe representative barry on a prior
hearing

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that some polling indicated
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
something like 40 percent of voters in
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire don't trust the voting
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
system um any time we create a favored
 
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.430 align:start position:0%
system um any time we create a favored
class

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh of people particularly and as to
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
voting rights it diminishes the the
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
voting rights of other people if college
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
students meet the domicile requirements
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
set forth in the other rsas and by court
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
cases they are certainly entitled to
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
vote no matter where whether they go to
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
a state school or a private school
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
but to have a blanket provision
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
specifically singling them out as having
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
a special right to vote
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
really diminishes the rights of all the
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
rest of our citizens
 
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's no different than why don't we have
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
a uh for example a a section of an rsa
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
that says a uh blue-eyed people get
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
special rights to votes no matter where
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
how how long they've lived here or you
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
know what they do or whatever you know
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
you can you can do all sorts of absurd
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
type of things
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
but somehow or another we've created
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
this special class
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
of voters and it really is unfair to the
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
vast majority of voters if college
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
students qualify they qualify if they
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
don't qualify they don't qualify but
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
merely being a college student going to
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
school in new hampshire shouldn't be the
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
basis for
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
automatically being entitled to vote in
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire matters
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
because i've tried to limit my testimony
 
00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.150 align:start position:0%
because i've tried to limit my testimony
to

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
my presentation to three minutes or less
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
i know you've got a lot of people on
 
00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:31.190 align:start position:0%
i know you've got a lot of people on
this

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
probably mostly college students so i
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
would like to not take any questions
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%

join us again here this morning welcome
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
if you can unmute i think we're all set
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chairwoman and
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee and i
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
am like miles brown probably someone who
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
spoke too much towards this issue before
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
when i thought that we were on that bill
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the clarification
 
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.470 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the clarification
but

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
again i do want to speak to this as a
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
resident of the town of hanover where
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
dartmouth college is located
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i want to counter that notion that
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
somehow we are creating a privileged
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
group because i think that's the way we
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
frighten people into
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
trying to shut down something to suggest
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
that someone else is losing when someone
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
gains and frankly
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
the right to vote is not a lose-win
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
situation we all have differences of
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
opinion about candidates that's not an
 
00:46:55.839 --> 00:46:56.870 align:start position:0%
opinion about candidates that's not an
issue

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
of course one candidate will win and
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
another one will lose but what we are
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
really about it seems to me
 
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.790 align:start position:0%
really about it seems to me
is

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
equitable access to the polls
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
who are members of community to find
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
those ways that they can vote
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
dartmouth students contribute to the
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
economic well-being of this community
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that is true in other college towns
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
they support
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
organizations within the community from
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
the cancer center to the children's
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
hospital at dartmouth
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
they do research projects that benefit
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
small businesses they tutor students
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
they are vitally involved i and giving
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
them the right to vote
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
is about as american as we can be

00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%

sentence i'm just gonna finish my
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
sentence to have a false equivalency to
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
say it's like privileging blue-eyed
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
the stated purpose of this bill is to
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
repeal the consideration of a student's
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
educational institution as his or her
 
00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
place of domicile for voting purposes
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising voters is clearly
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in order to get around
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
that the proposed legislation has to be
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted this bill fails to do
 
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.270 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted this bill fails to do
that

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
within the language of the bill are a
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
number of accepted proofs of residency
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
if this path if this bill passes all the
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
student has to do is obtain a document
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
and i quote
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
from a person who is listed on such
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
document or other reasonable proof of
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
ownership or control of the property
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
attesting that you reside at that
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
address signed by that person or his or
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
her agent who manages the property
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
in other words any person with some
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
level of responsibility such as a dorm
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
manager an elected frat house officer or
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
the person who signed the lease on an
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
apartment can attest to the student's
 
00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.349 align:start position:0%
apartment can attest to the student's
residence

00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
residence
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
the students who live at home and
 
00:50:50.790 --> 00:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
commute to school will simply register
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
to vote in their home precincts
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
this bill fails in its intent and is
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
another poorly crafted bill that should
 
00:51:01.109 --> 00:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
go nowhere i am opposed to this bill
 
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:02.800 align:start position:0%

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh and one of the things that i really
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up to your attention is
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
in 2017 sb3 was brought into law and
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
that dealt with an amendment to rsa 654
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
which is the same amendment or the same
 
00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:03.910 align:start position:0%
which is the same amendment or the same
uh

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
that hb 362 would be amending
 
00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.309 align:start position:0%
that hb 362 would be amending
so

00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
in uh rsa 259 23
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
there is a definition of domicile
 
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:15.990 align:start position:0%
there is a definition of domicile
and

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
the the reason that uh sb3 was brought
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
up was to make it so that it matched the
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
definition in 259
 
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.190 align:start position:0%
definition in 259
so

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
why was there a
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
any discussion about changing it after
 
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.589 align:start position:0%
any discussion about changing it after
just

00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
about four years now from 2017 to 2021
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
it makes
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
zero sense
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
that something that was changed to be in
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
line with one another would be changed
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
again to fit
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that students would be ineligible
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that is brought up for
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
political reasons
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
to prevent students from voting
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
and it is wrong based off of that
 
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
as as we know students live a minimum of
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
nine months a year that's august through
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
december and february through may
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
on in new hampshire
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
and they designate their their dorms as
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
a place of an abode and it's their
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
primary place of physical presence
 
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.950 align:start position:0%
primary place of physical presence
so

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
since the definition of 259 is uh which
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'm using because
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
it will remain unaltered uh no matter
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the passage of hb 362.
 
00:55:25.839 --> 00:55:27.430 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the passage of hb 362.
um

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
would that domicile definition
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
as it states a natural person taking up
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
residence in a town or city within the
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
state and includes but is not limited to
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
occupying a primary place of habitation
 
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
does that not meet that definition
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
and in article 11
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's any inhabitant who is domiciled
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
here in the state has the right to vote
 
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr heath if you could wrap it
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
up that would be great all right i
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
i didn't i have concluded
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh all right okay thank you um does
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thanks for joining us
 
00:56:14.319 --> 00:56:15.109 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thanks for joining us
then

00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
on this morning uh
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning my name is ben i'm 23.
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
um i graduated from unh in 2019 i live
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
in newmarket now
 
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here to testify in opposition to hb
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
362 it's my goal to briefly share my
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
personal story to illustrate some of the
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
realities of being a modern young person
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
and a college student that this bill
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
completely fails to understand making an
 
00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
undeniably bad policy
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
so to briefly share my story i grew up
 
00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
in southeast connecticut it was a fine
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
place but a place i knew i did not want
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
to live after high school i made that
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
choice pretty early on 17 i got into unh
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i came to live in new hampshire for
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
the first time at 18. i was excited to
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
live in a new place and get to know a
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
community as an adult for the first time
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
2016 election season rolls around that
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
was quite the experience for me being
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
new to new hampshire as i'm sure you all
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
know the special time on the
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
presidential election year is in new
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i voted for the first time
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
ever in my life being just 18 um in that
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
2016 election on election day i
 
00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.670 align:start position:0%
2016 election on election day i
registered

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
registered
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
um day of in person to vote in durham it
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
was fast easy satisfying i was excited
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
to do this in a new place i called home
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm sharing the story to share that
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
like the experience of being 18 and 19
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
and moving from your hometown for the
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
first time is one that thousands of
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
people in the state are currently living
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
and one that you members of the
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
community might share or had shared at
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
one point i would challenge you to think
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
back to that feeling when i was 18 i had
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
made the choice that i was not going to
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
live where i grew up but i had no idea
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
where i wanted to live instead the only
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
thing that was certain was i would spend
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
more than nine months of my next four
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
years living in new hampshire
 
00:58:10.319 --> 00:58:11.270 align:start position:0%
years living in new hampshire
um

00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
and potentially longer than that you
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
know if it took longer to finish my
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
degree or if i wanted to stay here after
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
like i had chose um and still live here
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
when it came to voting i was i
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
understood that i was being asked a very
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
basic question do you want to
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
participate in the governance of your
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
community my answer was yes and the
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
community i wanted to participate in was
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
obviously the community i was now living
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
in for the vast majority of my year
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i left new hampshire during some
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
summers to work that's a normal thing
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
that people do people have to work jobs
 
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the summer to be able to afford to go
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
to school here that's fine normal people
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
travel for work all the time sometimes
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's extended periods of time
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the question that bill
 
00:58:47.829 --> 00:58:47.839 align:start position:0%
asked is essentially should students be
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
able to vote in new hampshire or
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
presumably be forced to vote in the town
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
that they were last living in or not
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
vote at all if my parents had moved
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
while i was in college to a completely
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
new place where would i vote then
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
i would not have an address in
 
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.870 align:start position:0%
i would not have an address in
connecticut

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
why is it mr kramer
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
if you could wrap it up that would be
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
great yeah i'll make my last point um
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
why is it more correct for me to vote in
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
a town in which my parents live and not
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
the town in which i currently live
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
there's no other time we consider
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
someone's previous address to be more
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
important than their current address for
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
this the intention of this bill is to
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
improve the quality or function of new
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire elections it simply does not
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
accomplish that the intention of this
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill is to disenfranchise young people
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%

the dog i'm testifying in opposition to
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
hb 362.
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
i was a freshman at the university of
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in 2016.
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
it was my first time voting in any
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
election as i had just turned 18 years
 
01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:41.510 align:start position:0%
election as i had just turned 18 years
old

01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
i was 50 minutes away from home and in
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
an unfamiliar environment
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
however the community that i found at
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
unh made it so i never felt alone in
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
that historical election
 
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
freshmen are not allowed car access on
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
campus and i could not always count on
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
my parents to be able to drive that long
 
01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
distance especially because election day
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
is not a holiday in this state
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
had it not been for my ability to
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
register in the town of durham for
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
voting i would have missed some of the
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
most vital elections in the past four
 
01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:13.829 align:start position:0%
most vital elections in the past four
years

01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
we are brought up to understand that our
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
right to vote in the us is sacred
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
we are taught that it is one of the
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
things that makes this country great
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
when the officials in office write up
 
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
bills that make voting more difficult i
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
struggle to believe the legitimacy of
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
the values we were taught as children
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
if voting is all the adults in our lives
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
told it told us it was then that right
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
must be given to us in full with no
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
restrictions that would make it less
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
accessible for some of us
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
this bill is furthermore both classist
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
and ableist it completely excludes
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
groups of people who are not able to
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
access off-campus voting and i
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly oppose this bill i will
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
not be taking questions
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
pinto i'm a resident of dover and i'm
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of new hampshire youth
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
movement testifying in opposition to hb
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
429 as well as 554 and 362.
 
01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:54.799 align:start position:0%
i urge you all to not make it harder for
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
students to vote here in new hampshire
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
whether you realize it or not these
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
attacks send a strong message to the
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
young people who are choosing to live
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
and pursue their education here in new
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire that their voices aren't
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
welcomed and that our state doesn't want
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
them to participate in our democratic
 
01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.309 align:start position:0%
them to participate in our democratic
process

01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
the fact is new hampshire is already the
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
highest exporter of young people in the
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
country and we need to be doing
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
everything we can to ensure young people
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
are able to invest in a future here
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
getting involved in politics can be a
 
01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
pathway towards young people growing
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
their personal stake in living here and
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
as people who spend the majority of
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
their years here they deserve the right
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
to vote and participate in issues that
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
would directly impact them this is often
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
the first time they've come of eligible
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
voting age and that means it doesn't
 
01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
make sense for them to vote in a state
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
they've never been involved in the
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
politics of
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
i know when i went to college my mom
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
took the opportunity to move to another
 
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
state so with this bill that would have
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
left me without a place to vote at all
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
is that really what we want for people
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
who are newly coming into the ability to
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
participate in our democracy
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
i urge you all to do everything you can
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
to make our state more equitable for the
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
young people who live go to school work
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
and want to see a future for themselves
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%

in a state we love so much
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
as the home of the first presidential
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
primary new hampshire is a unique place
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
to engage with politics young people
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
eager to get involved with american
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
governance are attracted to new
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire for this very reason but
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
without student voting rights aspiring
 
01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:37.839 align:start position:0%
politicians and change makers lack the
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
incentive to move here new hampshire's
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
motto live free or die speaks to the
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
importance of voting rights to live free
 
01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
is to have a voice in how you live
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
voting grants students the opportunity
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
to live free in their home state thank
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%

under the attendees
um

01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%

yes i'm here uh good morning and thank
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to testify my
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
name is josh calianos and i'm here in
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb 362. i'm a dartmouth
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
student and new hampshire taxpayer as
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
you know new hampshire supreme court
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
requires the private universities in the
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
state pay property tax and god knows
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
that bill is passed on to me through
 
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.309 align:start position:0%
that bill is passed on to me through
tuition

01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm also here to say that my choice to
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
live and work at school is no different
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
from the choice to rent an apartment or
 
01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:40.390 align:start position:0%
from the choice to rent an apartment or
home

01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
this bill tells students that their
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
rights conferred by residency are
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
contingent on who their landlord is this
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
distinction is critical and meaningless
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
because students who choose to live on
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
campus are no more or less connected to
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
the state than those who sign a lease
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
we all have a set graduation date
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm here to testify because my
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
experience over the last year shows how
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
unwieldy the new law will be
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
last spring i rented an apartment in the
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
state for the first time i was not
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
enrolled in classes and i worked at a
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
firm in hanover at the height of the
 
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic i signed up to be a disaster
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
relief worker through new hampshire
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
response for all intents and purposes i
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
was not a student at the time
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
yet i remained registered to vote here i
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
went to virtual town meeting you got the
 
01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
went to virtual town meeting you got the
idea

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
however had i needed to change my voter
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
registration this january when i moved
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
back into on-campus housing this bill
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
would have said i am no resident
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
seriously mr silber tell that to my new
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license and car
 
01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
hampshire driver's license and car
registration

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
tell that to my disaster relief
 
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:36.549 align:start position:0%
tell that to my disaster relief
registration

01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
this bill draws a meaningless
 
01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
distinction between on-campus and
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
off-campus housing
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
it attacks those of us who live on
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
campus who have the longest remaining
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
tenure in the state because those are uh
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
frequently the youngest students
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
i think the transient's explanation for
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is completely wrong and i
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
asked mr silver to state a valid
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
explanation for this bill before
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr galliano's uh taking
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
questions i will
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr kalianos
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
some members here in the committee room
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
or online
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%

student at dartmouth college i'm here

today to speak in opposition of house
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
bill 362.
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
this bill promises to take away my right
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
to vote in new hampshire quite frankly
 
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely egregious that this
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
body seeks to silence my vote my voice
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
i came to the granite state in the fall
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
of 2020 eager to participate in the
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
electoral process new hampshire is my
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
home for the foreseeable future i will
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
spend the vast majority of my time in
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
hanover my primary legislative advocacy
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
will be focused on new hampshire
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
politics yet this bill will steal my
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
right to vote for the candidates i
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
support here whoever they may be
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
i have only voted once in an election
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i did so in hanover new hampshire
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
using a ballot with the new hampshire
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
state seal at the top and i can say with
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
absolute certainty that that moment in
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
which i exercised my civic duty for the
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
very first time was the highlight of my
 
01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:11.910 align:start position:0%
very first time was the highlight of my
year

01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
the pride i felt when handing my ballot
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
to the town clerk was enormous not
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
simply because it was my first time
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
voting but because i was voting for
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
candidates i cared about
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
students like me who are domiciled at
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
their college or university are not
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
ignorant of new hampshire politics nor
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
careless with their vote
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
i voted in new hampshire because i care
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
and because i am deeply concerned about
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
the policies that affect me and my life
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
here and if the intent of this bill is
 
01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
to deter those like me who are informed
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
and careful with their vote well i
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully urge you all to reconsider
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
the bill's merit as citizens of the
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
united states we should all be actively
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
involved in uplifting voices not
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
silencing them this bill treats voting
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
like a privilege but it is a federally
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
mandated right and i will continue to
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
fight for my right to vote as long as it
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%

so that you can join us with audio if
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%

hi um i am here as a student at plymouth
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
state university to oppose testify to
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
so voting is one right we have as
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
american citizens to participate in our
 
01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.270 align:start position:0%
american citizens to participate in our
democracy

01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
as an out-of-state college student
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
taking away my ability to vote in the
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
state that i spend
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
basically all of my time
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
shows how careless and out of touch you
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
guys really are i live in this state
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
shop in this state and i take advantage
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
of everything it has to offer
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
and this really makes me feel as if none
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
of that matters and you're kind of just
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
using me for my money
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
allowing out-of-state students to vote
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
is necessary and
 
01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
we really should um have a voice in the
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
community that we reside in thank you
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%

01:18:27.189 --> 01:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
an out-of-state student do you live here
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%

01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
and if you unmute i think we're all set
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chairwoman and
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
my name is doug drucker and i'm a
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
resident of durham and a current
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
graduate student at the university of
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and i urge this committee
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
to oppose hb 362. i also want to extend
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
my opposition to both hb 429
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
and 554
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
as a lifelong resident of new hampshire
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation may not impact me
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
directly but it will impact many in my
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
community as a college student member of
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
the unh community and someone who deeply
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
cherishes our democratic process this
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
legislation disturbs me
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
as an undergraduate i had the privilege
 
01:19:40.950 --> 01:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
of living with my parents in new
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire to save money on college costs
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
as a graduate student i began renting an
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
apartment in durham where i am currently
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
registered however not everyone has
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
afforded the same economic and familial
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
privileges as myself
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
as off-campus housing prices skyrocket
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
students are left with few housing
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
options outside of on-campus dormitories
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
additionally not everyone has the luxury
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
of affording a vehicle that they can
 
01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
then register
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
not only does this bill discriminate
 
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
against the youth vote but it
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
disproportionately targets students who
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
are economically disadvantaged by
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
prohibiting educational institutions as
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
a student's place of domicile for voting
 
01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.229 align:start position:0%
a student's place of domicile for voting
purposes

01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation is nothing more than a
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
desperate attempt to concentrate
 
01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
political power and purge youth voters
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
from participating in the democratic
 
01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
from participating in the democratic
process

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
instead of discouraging student voters
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
in the state there needs to be more of
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
an effort to provide adequate voting
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
resources that make it easier for
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
college students to participate instead
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
of attacking students interest in civic
 
01:20:46.630 --> 01:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
engagement we should be rewarding it
 
01:20:48.630 --> 01:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
college students are an integral part of
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
the broader granite state community and
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
they deserve to be recognized as such
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i will not
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
be accepting any questions
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that was dow drucker
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%

362 and some other bills that we're
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%

heinrich i am sure i did not pronounce
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
that correctly and thank you very much
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%

unmute you will be with us with
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
if you want mute you'll be with us
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
thank you there good morning chair
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
griffin vice jim mcdonald and honorable
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
members of the election law committee i
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
speak to you in opposition of house bill
 
01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.110 align:start position:0%
speak to you in opposition of house bill
362.

01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
362.
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
also 429 and 554
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
but specifically 362 which strikes the
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
use of an institution of higher learning
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
for establishing donuts aisle
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
obviously creates a weird special
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
treatment of dorms apart from all other
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
rental properties in the state
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
if we rent a dorm on our college campus
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
that would be our college address
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
but in regards to residency how is this
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
room any different from any other room
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
rented in the state we still live and
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
work in the state we spend large sums of
 
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
money in this state
 
01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
through this investment of time and
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
money we create jobs join churches
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
contribute to civic organizations and
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
participate in the community of this
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
state just like every other resident
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
to put this law in a different light if
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
my parents were to live in new hampshire
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
but i attended school in texas except
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
for winter break and the odd summer
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
vacation i could still vote in new
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire and influence the laws while
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
only being beholden to them for a few
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
months weeks a year
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
meanwhile a student who lives here could
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
see their right to vote stripped away
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's not as if we're sneaking across the
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
connecticut river in the dead of night
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
to collude with the little old ladies in
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
i also hear a lot of talk about how
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're gonna spend four years here but
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
that denies that many of us plan to set
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
our lives down here and spend far longer
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
why should we be treated differently
 
01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
than any other resident in the state
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire needs more young skilled
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
and devoted residents as are attracted
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the state's institutions of higher
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
learning there's a powerful choice on
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
the part of a student to choose new
 
01:23:10.229 --> 01:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire as their home and establish
 
01:23:10.239 --> 01:23:11.430 align:start position:0%
hampshire as their home and establish
domicile

01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
domicile
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
now we are faced with a powerful choice
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
of whether we should disenfranchise
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
these very members of the community
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
when i first arrived in the state i was
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
proud of the motto live free or die the
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
strong message of values convictions and
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
determination not only to protect our
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
own rights but all those around us
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
if i live work here and attend church
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
contribute to tax revenue and choose new
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire as my home beholden to all of
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
our laws and yet i'm deprived of
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
electoral influence over those laws i
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
think that's nothing short of tyranny
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%

01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
i love this country and i really believe
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
that one of the most patriotic things
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
someone can do is to vote
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh when i walk around my campus and see
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
the american flag i
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
i feel pride because i know that we in
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
this country stand for democracy
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's my civic duty to engage in the
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
political process of my community and i
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
know this is exactly what countless men
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
and women have fought for
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that every vote voice is heard
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
whether those voices are popular or not
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
this bill reveals a section that
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
clarifies the right to vote
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
that section is not about creating a
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
separate class of voters but making sure
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
that everyone who lives here has the
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
same opportunity to vote
 
01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a college student and i have the
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
honor a select number of students in the
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
country have because right now i'm able
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
to call new hampshire home
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
i vote here because i care about the
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
state i urge everyone present to vote no
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill and any other similar bills
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's also i believe a public health
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
consideration because i think that this
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
bill would make it harder for college
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
students to get the code vaccine
 
01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.550 align:start position:0%
students to get the code vaccine
eventually

01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
when inventory allows in phase 3b
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
but that would
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
not having that clarified would
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
encourage unvaccinated students to
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
travel across the state rather than
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
being vaccinated in their college
 
01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm open to all questions uh but
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
honestly you'll probably not get um
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
technical satisfactory answers uh thank

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%

i'm not going to uh repeat any of my
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony so instead i thought i
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
would just respond to
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
a point made by
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of this bill in his
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
rsa 654-1a
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
in fact does not create a special class
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
of voters for college students and that
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
statute was recently interpreted by the
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire supreme court in may
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
in casey versus gardner and
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
determined that what that every college
 
01:30:17.199 --> 01:30:18.149 align:start position:0%
determined that what that every college
student

01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
who registers to vote like every other
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
every other person who registers to vote
 
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.390 align:start position:0%
every other person who registers to vote
um

01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
meets the same residency obligations as
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh in the state and so
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
the meaning of the statute has been
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
interpreted and it does not put special
 
01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.669 align:start position:0%
interpreted and it does not put special
solicitude

01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
solicitude
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
on college students to be able to vote
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
in fact um
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
hb 362 would would do the opposite
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
because so many before me have said
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh it would remove
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
as a consideration for domicile purposes
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
um the maintaining of a college dorm
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
address so
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy to take questions um if
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
there are any and i and i refer the
 
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:58.000 align:start position:0%

01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members in
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%

01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%

house bill 362.
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes i know i'm i continue to be
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
represented timothy oregon i continue to
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
represent stratfor district 6 the towns
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:42.310 align:start position:0%
of durham and madbury and um
i

01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
like to send in written testimony in pdf
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
form but you probably don't receive it
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
so after you're already there um
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
the question that came up well my main
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
point is students have the same voting
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
rights as any other citizens as uh
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
attorney clement philbin said by the way
 
01:31:59.430 --> 01:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
we both uh for those years apart we both
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
went to the same uh
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
undergraduate college columbia
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
university in new york city and we both
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
had parents who were in the legislature
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
at the time but i don't know how
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
whether he voted in new york city or in
 
01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.629 align:start position:0%
whether he voted in new york city or in
in

01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
nashua but uh
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
certainly um there were even back in the
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
mid 70s there were many uh
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
students on campus who were registered
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
to vote at their on campus addresses it
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
was allowable in new york state and
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
actually every state back back then it's
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
been away since the voting rights law in
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
the mid 60s and uh at columbia actually
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
even had a polling place on campus which
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
didn't just serve the campus also some
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the surrounding community but yes
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's nothing new so
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know students have the right to vote
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
the community to live attending a local
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
college university is as valid a reason
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
as any other from moving to a community
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
and as
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
other people have pointed out uh
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
most students vote and do other things
 
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
you may do they don't spend all their
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
time going to school
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
so an on campus or off-campus student
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
dwelling is a good place as any
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh live it's as well as any other place
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
where people may live and also a college
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
is also a time when students develop new
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
lifelong habits and voting is a good
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
habit so we should be encouraging them
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
finally and as you mentioned under both
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
federal and state law students have the
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
right to vote where they live
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's been the case uh
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
well especially since the voting rights
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
law but in new hampshire even before
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
that and uh
 
01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'll mention two landmark federal
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
decisions on the 1972 neuberger versus
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
peterson case uber actually was a
 
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
student at dartmouth college and
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
peterson was water peterson the governor
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
that was a dartmouth student who had no
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
back home thank you representative
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
horgan that is a much cited case here in
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
the election law committee if you could
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
wrap up that would be great and i know
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
it was in your pdf
 
01:33:46.149 --> 01:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
and also mentioned the sims versus
 
01:33:48.149 --> 01:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
united states decision that finally if
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea there's a drafting
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
error it takes out rsa 654 1
 
01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.709 align:start position:0%
error it takes out rsa 654 1
comma

01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
comma
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 1 along with uh
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 1a so that um
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
not sure why why was written that way
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
but i'm opposed to the bill so it's a
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
move point for me but
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
if you do go forward you might want to
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
look into whether that was the right way
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
to draft it so anyways um i'm richard it
 
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.189 align:start position:0%
to draft it so anyways um i'm richard it
thanks

01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you if there's
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr horrigan for
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
i think that is the correct it's the
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
overall paragraph and then the sub

and i'm a supervisor of the checklist
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
all i wanted to do is clarify
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
on one of the speakers before
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
you have to be a registered voter
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
to run for any office
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what he was talking about
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
if you are not a registered voter you
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
cannot run for a town office or a state
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
office so just wanted to clarify that
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
for the committee and that's it because
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%

and thank you for clairing that mr
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
millman said that at the end of his
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
testimony and i wasn't sure he
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not i wasn't sure about the
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
statement so thanks for clarifying that
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520 align:start position:0%

01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and i will be very
 
01:42:41.679 --> 01:42:42.550 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and i will be very
brief

01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to point out uh in house
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
bill 362
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh on line two and representative
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
horrigan already mentioned this but
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
part of what's being repealed in this
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
statute is rsa 654 colon one roman
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
numeral one and that is
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
a part of the statute that talks about
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
voter eligibility generally
 
01:43:05.669 --> 01:43:05.679 align:start position:0%
it's not specific to college students
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it's the intent of
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
anybody to have that section
 
01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:11.030 align:start position:0%
anybody to have that section
repealed

01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
the second comment that i would like to
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
make is that section two of the bill
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
addresses language that was put in the
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
statute under senate bill 3.
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 3
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
is currently being
 
01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:24.390 align:start position:0%
is currently being
litigated

01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
litigated
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
due to
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of that statute
 
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
and so the uh the provisions in section
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
two are currently
 
01:43:34.950 --> 01:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh unenforceable they're they're
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
enjoined by the court
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
so uh i would uh suggest i guess that
 
01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
before we amend that portion of the
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
statute we wait until
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
the court uh makes a final decision
 
01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
on whether that law was was
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional or not
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you deputy scanlon for clarifying
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
that i apologize to committee members
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
and members of the public i was aware of
 
01:44:01.189 --> 01:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that that was just represented
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
to you by deputy scanlon that provisions
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
of the law that were changed by sb3
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
are enjoined though technically on the
 
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:10.870 align:start position:0%
are enjoined though technically on the
books

01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
so um some of the requested changes uh
 
01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
create some process issues in regards to
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
what's going on so thank you for that
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%

01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:25.040 align:start position:0%

01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that was
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
i graduated from the university of new
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire in 2019 and was around when hb
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
1264 was up in 2018 and just wanted to
 
01:45:02.639 --> 01:45:03.910 align:start position:0%
1264 was up in 2018 and just wanted to
respond

01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%

01:45:06.239 --> 01:45:07.030 align:start position:0%

that
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
after listening to many people's
 
01:45:08.719 --> 01:45:10.149 align:start position:0%
after listening to many people's
testimony

01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
i do not know how he
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
made this a matter of laziness
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
this is not a matter of laziness or a
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
refusal to vote absentee or an inability
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
to vote absentee miss abramson just to
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
sort of keep things moving in the right
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
direction we try to focus our comments
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
on what we want to say about bills not
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
what we think somebody else might have
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
said that was
 
01:45:34.239 --> 01:45:35.430 align:start position:0%
said that was
um

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that many people might
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
agree or disagree on but thank you okay
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%

a college student it's you know an
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%

for your identity and figuring out where
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%

01:46:59.669 --> 01:46:59.679 align:start position:0%
in manchester and i'm speaking today on
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of the new hampshire high school
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
democrats in opposition to hb 362.
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed to hp 362 because it would
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
violate students constitutional rights
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
to vote in this state while they are
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
domiciled here
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution states
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
that any inhabitant of the state 18
 
01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:16.239 align:start position:0%
years or older is eligible to vote and
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
that an inhabitant is somebody who has
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
domicile here
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
well i understand there is some
 
01:47:22.149 --> 01:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
confusion about the exact meaning of the
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
word domicile i think it's fair to say
 
01:47:24.870 --> 01:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
that somebody who spends the vast
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
majority of their time here should be
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
considered to live here
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
anyone who lives in the dorms at a
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
college is spending the majority of
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
their time in new hampshire
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
during the almost 10 months of the
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
school year covers students sleep here
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
eat here and get their educations here
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
during those 37 weeks they contribute
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars to new
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire's economy through their
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
tuition they pay taxes on all the same
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
purchases as other residents and they're
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
in their paychecks here
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
so for all practical for all practical
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
purposes college students in new
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire are residents we should not be
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
attempting to disenfranchise them by
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
refusing them the right to proper
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
representation in our elections
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
by trying to suppress college voting
 
01:48:00.790 --> 01:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
rights we tell students in new hampshire
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
that they are not valuable and do not
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
deserve to be considered part of our
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
state and i think it's only right that
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
we give them what they are
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
constitutionally guaranteed and allow
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
college students to vote in new
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire by enabling them to establish
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
domicile so i thank the committee very
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
much for their time and urge them to
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%

rockingham county district 14 which is
 
01:49:44.709 --> 01:49:44.719 align:start position:0%
the town of atkinson and plaistow
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
this bill originally was going to be a
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
bill to
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
define what temporary is because it's
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's really not defined right now and
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
speaking with several people we couldn't
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
come to a
 
01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:58.870 align:start position:0%
come to a
uh

01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
a conclusion exactly what that should be
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
i i think it should be one year but
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
anyway so so we decided to go the
 
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.430 align:start position:0%
anyway so so we decided to go the
the

01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
committee route to
 
01:50:09.199 --> 01:50:10.629 align:start position:0%
committee route to
ascertain

01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
ascertain
 
01:50:13.590 --> 01:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
what temporary means in regard to
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
that term used in voting and the reason
 
01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:16.550 align:start position:0%
that term used in voting and the reason
i

01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
brought this up
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
during the 2020 election
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
had put out a statement that for any
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
any college student
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:50:32.550 --> 01:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
not in the state physically
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
had attended say unh or plymouth one of
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire colleges
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
and they were not physically coming to
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
the state to go to school but they were
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
doing zoom learning
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
had the right to
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
pull an absentee ballot and vote in the
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire you could only
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
had to take
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
one semester of classes
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
in fact technically it didn't even say
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
you had to be here physically taking any
 
01:50:56.800 --> 01:50:57.750 align:start position:0%
you had to be here physically taking any
classes

01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
classes
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i contacted the office and asked the
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
question um
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
how can that be
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
and i was told well they're temporarily
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
out of the state so my next question was
 
01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.229 align:start position:0%
out of the state so my next question was
well

01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
term or what does the the
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
you know define what temporary is in
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
regard to a time frame
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
and the answer i got was there really
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
isn't one
 
01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:21.109 align:start position:0%
isn't one
so

01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
own property in new hampshire or not
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
and have your company
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
theoretically assign you to another
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
state to work
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
you could claim you're there temporarily
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
be a temporary on a temporary basis
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
and never come back into the state for
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
years and it's still considered that
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
you're a new hampshire resident so it
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
seems to me we should have some kind of
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
limit on that so this what this um
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
study committee attempts to do is to
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
come up with a consensus of what makes
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
the most sense now granted there should
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
be exceptions for example
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
members of the military um
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
expats that are out of the country for
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
extended periods of times we we should
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
have a caval for that but i believe
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh for the rest of what seems to happen
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
right now there should be some kind of
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
definition for it
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
so it's it's that simple i hope you
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
support uh going to the study committee
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
so we can come up with a with a firm
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
definition of what uh temporary is in
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
regard to voting
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
with that i'll take any questions the
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
committee may have on the subject
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative teresa and
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
two questions um
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
is this film aimed more at
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
people who are temporarily residents of
 
01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
the state or is it aimed more at
 
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
defining those who are temporarily
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
as it were outside the boundaries of the
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
state that claim residency in the state
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
that's the first question the second i
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
guess is
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding that federal law
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
regulates the durational residency
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
offices like the presidency and the vice
 
01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:02.470 align:start position:0%
offices like the presidency and the vice
presidency

01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
presidency
 
01:53:04.149 --> 01:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
um is this
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
is this that would this study group be
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
aiming at defining temporary with
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
respect to only statewide
 
01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:11.270 align:start position:0%
respect to only statewide
thank offices

01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank offices
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
no no this all right thanks for the
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
question representative so know that
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
this um would define temporary as it
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
pertains to somebody that is a stated
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire resident but that is out
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the state for ex extended period of
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
time and so
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
what the attempt is here is to define
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
what that means so if you're out of
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
state for six months for whatever reason
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
um should you have the right to
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
vote here certainly if you're out of the
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
state for ten years or more never
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
sitting sitting foot back in the state
 
01:53:42.629 --> 01:53:42.639 align:start position:0%
most people would probably say no that
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed so this attempts to
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
find a
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know a reasonable number there in
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
calendar months or calendar years if you
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
want to put it that way so it pertains
 
01:53:55.270 --> 01:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
to somebody that's a resident here now
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
or or claims to be a resident that in
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
actuality has been out of the state for
 
01:54:03.350 --> 01:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
we need you to unmute we can't hear you
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions from anybody here in
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
or attending excuse me for the
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%

508 i became aware that there was an
 
01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.310 align:start position:0%
508 i became aware that there was an
issue

01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to temporary residence
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
when as we all know due to the covet
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
pandemic people who use
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh facilities in the state for
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
parts of the year primarily the issue
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
arose quite honestly in regards to
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
student attendance um we're not back in
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
attending school
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
albeit for some or part of the year so
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
it did raise the issue generally as to
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
what's a temporary resident
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
i will tell you in the past i am aware
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
that people who own vacation homes in
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
other states have called our secretary
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
of state's office and said well hey i've
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
got a house out there
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
up in the white mountains can i vote in
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
your elections in new hampshire yeah i
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
have a license in california and live
 
01:56:34.790 --> 01:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
here but can i vote there those
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
questions have
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
occurred and that it then
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
i thought that perhaps it was time to
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
address it
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
a little more clearly in regards to the
 
01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:46.629 align:start position:0%
a little more clearly in regards to the
statutes

01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
in consideration of what was going on it
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
appeared that there should be some
 
01:56:52.159 --> 01:56:53.910 align:start position:0%
appeared that there should be some
tangible

01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
tangible
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
location that was tied to somebody
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
maintaining a domicile you've heard
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
discussion this morning about the
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
recognition of college dormitories or
 
01:57:02.239 --> 01:57:03.109 align:start position:0%
recognition of college dormitories or
other

01:57:03.109 --> 01:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
places certainly i think many of us have
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
an apartment or house that we use as
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
the uh point of connection to the state
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire to claim that we are
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately here for voting so what
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
you see in house bill 554 is my attempt
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
to define that i was not aware of the
 
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 508 when this was being
 
01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.350 align:start position:0%
house bill 508 when this was being
drafted

01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps
 
01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
what the committee might consider in its
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
deliberations is if indeed a committee
 
01:57:36.709 --> 01:57:36.719 align:start position:0%
is formed to study this issue
 
01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
um that in in that case perhaps 554
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
should be retained to be able to deal
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
with the recommendations of the study
 
01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.470 align:start position:0%
with the recommendations of the study
committee

01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:57:46.229 --> 01:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
with that um i am done and would be
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%

any questions from those participating
 
01:58:01.109 --> 01:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
online representatives

thank you representative i just
um

01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
just looking at the language changes
 
01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:12.070 align:start position:0%
just looking at the language changes
um

01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm i want to clarify the the core
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
intent for instance take
 
01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:17.990 align:start position:0%
intent for instance take
line

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
um 12
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the first page of the of the of the
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
bill where it's where it lives is
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
crossed out and maintains a physical
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
presence is substituted
 
01:58:27.679 --> 01:58:28.550 align:start position:0%
presence is substituted
um

01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
01:58:31.589 --> 01:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
both of those seem sort of i don't know
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
synonymous to my
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:36.229 align:start position:0%
i guess
non-lawyers

01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
non-lawyers
 
01:58:36.239 --> 01:58:37.510 align:start position:0%
non-lawyers
eyes

01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
eyes
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
what's the bill getting it with that
 
01:58:40.870 --> 01:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
kind of substitution
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
well i
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think that that's getting at the
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
vacation home from the person in
 
01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
california who
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
has um
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
a nexus to the state but doesn't in in
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
fact really maintain a physical presence
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
to the exclusion of anything else here
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's where i you know
 
01:59:05.830 --> 01:59:05.840 align:start position:0%
this state has spent countless hours
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
debating the terms inhabitant domicile
 
01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:11.430 align:start position:0%
debating the terms inhabitant domicile
and

01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.550 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
um
resident

01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
resident
 
01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:14.790 align:start position:0%
resident
and

01:59:14.790 --> 01:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
it's been the subject of constitutional
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
conventions actually so
 
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
we hear in hearings a lot people using
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
the word live
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
and at some point i think we need to
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
recognize that maybe in some of the
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
statutes trying to nail it down a little
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
more would be helpful maybe not but
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
further questions for representative
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.950 --> 01:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
i am seeing none
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative griffin thank
 
01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.910 align:start position:0%

okay we have uh several people signed up
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
to testify on this uh the first one
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'll try to pronounce them correctly
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative griffin did an excellent
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
job earlier clementowitz i believe it is
 
02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
and um envy clementowitz
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%

02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
mr clementowitz i think i just came to
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
the rescue for you so if you unmute you
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.270 --> 02:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
um good morning members of the house
 
02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
election law committee again my name is
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
henry clementowicz and i am a lawyer
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
with and a lobbyist for the american
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
civil liberties union of new hampshire
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to testify in opposition to
 
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
rsi 554
 
02:00:46.070 --> 02:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry hp 554. so uh there's two
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
points that i i want to make
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh the first involves the changes on
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
page one
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
lines twenty
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
through 28
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
um which make two uh language editions
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
both of which um
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh talk change the common law definition
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
of domicile that um regarding an uh a
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
temporary absence or an absence from
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
domicile before a new domicile is gay
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
and so i i lay out in
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
my written testimony how
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
i think there are um there's a group of
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
people who might be prevented from
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
voting anywhere
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
by the change that adds um except when
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
the physical location of the domicile is
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
no longer related to the person either
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
by virtue of lease or deed or physical
 
02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
by virtue of lease or deed or physical
presence

02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
presence
 
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and so i think that you know
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
to the extent that there are people who
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
are prevented from voting at all by this
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
change in language i think it's uh a
 
02:01:45.990 --> 02:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
pretty clear constitutional violation
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
i also
 
02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:48.870 align:start position:0%
i also
sorry

02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:49.669 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

02:01:49.669 --> 02:01:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
i also
 
02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:51.830 align:start position:0%
i also
um

02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that uh 2018's house
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
bill 1264
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
which changed the definition of resident
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
under the motor vehicle code to align
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
with the definition of domicile
 
02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:05.990 align:start position:0%
with the definition of domicile
um

02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
i wonder if that would no longer be the
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
case um
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
if this bill becomes law and the
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
definition of domicile is changed
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
there's some discussion
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
in the casey versus gardner case from
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
2020 where the new hampshire supreme
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
court examines rsa 654-1
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
the common law definition of domicile
 
02:02:27.030 --> 02:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
and the definition of residency under
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
rsa 259
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
and i had understood that a large
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
portion of this body was interested in
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
making those two definitions the same
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if this change would no
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
longer do that and so sort of undo the
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sorry i didn't hear that could
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
you wrap up um we're limiting time on
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony sure sure i just have one
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
more point to make which is about the
 
02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:54.390 align:start position:0%
more point to make which is about the
last

02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
um sentence that's added in
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
on page two lines seven through nine and
 
02:03:01.669 --> 02:03:01.679 align:start position:0%
i addressed this more in my written
 
02:03:01.679 --> 02:03:02.950 align:start position:0%
i addressed this more in my written
testimony

02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
but by adding this language about a
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
person who maintains
 
02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
um a domicile address in another state
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
and is eligible to retain that domicile
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
not being
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
eligible to gain domicile in new
 
02:03:17.109 --> 02:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire i think you know
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
number one that's probably already the
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
law because domicile requires
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
a person established a primary physical
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
place to the exclusion of all others but
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
number two to the to the extent that it
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
changes the law at all i think it really
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
just introduces more ambiguity because
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really discuss what it means
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
eligible to retain domicile
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
when domicile has a subjective component
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
so um so we oppose this bill for the the
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
constitutional and and policy reasons
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
that i i also identified in my written
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
house very much
 
02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
sir thank you questions for for this uh
 
02:03:54.390 --> 02:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
individual from the yes mr trojan
 
02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.109 align:start position:0%
individual from the yes mr trojan
representative

02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you sir
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question so we got to the the
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
first question you had on
 
02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:03.589 align:start position:0%
first question you had on
um

02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
the line 21 area the way i read that is
 
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
with the language changes that if you
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't have a domicile here or you you
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
own a piece of property that might have
 
02:04:15.189 --> 02:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
been a domicile that's now leased out to
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
somebody else so you're not living there
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
and you're out of state for
 
02:04:20.550 --> 02:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
a period of time that you wouldn't have
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
the right to vote
 
02:04:24.550 --> 02:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
with that in this state would that is is
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
that the um concern that you have
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
somebody that's that
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
is not domiciled here and not living
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
here should have the right to to vote
 
02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
please help me understand i'm not quite
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
clear on your opposition
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um i don't think that that
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
requires that a person go out of state
 
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
and so i use in my written testimony the
 
02:04:44.390 --> 02:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
example of a person who
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
grows up in manchester
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
establishes domicile when they turn 18
 
02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
by becoming a you know a big fan of the
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
fisher cats and you know deciding that
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
elm street revitalization is the most
 
02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
important thing to them
 
02:04:59.750 --> 02:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
they then go to unh at durham where they
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
live but they don't establish domicile
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
because it's no longer it's not their
 
02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
primary place for participating in
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
self-covering but then imagine that
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
their parents sell the house in
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
manchester and move to nashua
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
um and and the student in question has
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
never been to the new house in nashua
 
02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
never been to the new house in nashua
well

02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
under this law they wouldn't be allowed
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
to vote in manchester because they're
 
02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
not connected there by deed they
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be allowed to vote in durham
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
because it's not their primary physical
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
place for participating in democratic
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
self-government and they wouldn't be
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote in nashville because
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
they've never established a physical
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
presence there and so that's why
 
02:05:37.189 --> 02:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
the common law definition of domiciling
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
again this is discussed in the casey
 
02:05:40.629 --> 02:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
versus gardner case from our court last
 
02:05:40.639 --> 02:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
versus gardner case from our court last
year

02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
has a provision as the current law does
 
02:05:46.629 --> 02:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
that domicile once created
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
is maintained until a new domicile is
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
established so i hope that answers your
 
02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:51.830 align:start position:0%
established so i hope that answers your
question

02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%

clemento has covered most of what i
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to address
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
but just wanted to echo some of his
 
02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:38.149 align:start position:0%
but just wanted to echo some of his
concerns

02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
that it feels like almost every session
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
we are changing the definitions of
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
domicile and residency creating great
 
02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:45.750 align:start position:0%
domicile and residency creating great
confusion

02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
amongst voters in this state and i'm
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned about the last
 
02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
the changes in section 2a that last
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
sentence there
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
and i think continuing to move the goal
 
02:08:59.830 --> 02:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
posts on voters in the state as to who
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
is defined as eligible to vote in the
 
02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
is defined as eligible to vote in the
state

02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
creates a great deal of confusion um
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
which can act uh to suppress uh eligible
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
voters from taking part uh in our
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
elections um and with that i will
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
leave it there in the essence of time
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%

02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%

is long overdue
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
but what i'm the reason i've been
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
holding on uh staying on with the
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
election lawyer is to make sure
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
that the veterans are protected
 
02:10:05.589 --> 02:10:05.599 align:start position:0%
in in this law here because they are
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
like me when i went out somewhere for
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
three years i was temporarily there for
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
three years and then moved to another
 
02:10:13.270 --> 02:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
base for three years sometimes a year
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
and a half two years so i want to make
 
02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
sure that uh there is something in there
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
that protects those veterans there like
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
my son who was stationed in kuwait
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh who was temporary there and then he's
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
gonna be back in california
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
but his home record is here at my house
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
so that's all i have just to make sure
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
that these veterans in new hampshire are
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
protected thank you
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%

chair

02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question
 
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
i know that there are a lot of uh former
 
02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
foster youth in the military
 
02:10:53.990 --> 02:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
and if they age out of the system and
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
join the
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
military's if they
 
02:10:59.430 --> 02:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
would have an address that they may not
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
have enough say let's say an emotional
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
connection to anymore would they be
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
protected under under this bill
 
02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh they they should be protected uh
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
under the bill here because
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
when you join the military
 
02:11:12.950 --> 02:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
you have what's called the homer record
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
give you an idea when i was in the
 
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
marines my parents sold their house
 
02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:18.229 align:start position:0%
marines my parents sold their house
okay

02:11:18.229 --> 02:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
and moved up to new hampshire they sold
 
02:11:22.709 --> 02:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
out of massachusetts but because i was a
 
02:11:24.629 --> 02:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
resident of massachusetts i was still
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
able to use that address
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
um of my homer record because that's
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
where i joined the marines from
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%

hit the last four
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
paragraphs or five paragraphs of my
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony

just for brevity
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
when the question of temporary absence
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
was raised last year prior to the
 
02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:43.599 align:start position:0%
election the new hampshire attorney
 
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
general's election division and new
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire secretary of state's office
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
issued a statement on august 19 2020.
 
02:12:53.430 --> 02:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
quote once a student lawfully
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
establishes a domicile in new hampshire
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
under rsa 654 colon one the student does
 
02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
not lose his or her domicile due to
 
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
temporary absence
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
rsa 654 colon 2 states a domicile for
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
voting purposes acquired by any person
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
in any town shall not be interrupted or
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
lost by temporary absence they're from
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
with the intention of returning there to
 
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
as his or her domicile
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
common sense would dictate that those
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
registered voters have every intention
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
of returning to their domicile upon
 
02:13:31.189 --> 02:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
subside these uh subsiding of the
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic if they have not returned
 
02:13:35.270 --> 02:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
already and how is this different from a
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire employee working an on a
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
state project for six months or a year
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they too be disenfranchised the
 
02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
question of domicile and temporary
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
absence from it has been asked and
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
answered by a republican-led new
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%

goffstown uh for over two years and a
 
02:14:54.629 --> 02:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
registered voter

making many connections in the area
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
shopping at local stores and i've become
 
02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
familiar in the town in any way that a
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
a person familiar with the area should
 
02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:06.629 align:start position:0%
a person familiar with the area should

the calendar year and uh under hb 554
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
people who should theoretically be able
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
to make their voice heard in this
 
02:15:17.109 --> 02:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
community students like myself could
 
02:15:18.990 --> 02:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
face higher barriers of voter
 
02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.709 align:start position:0%
face higher barriers of voter
registration

02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
registration
 
02:15:22.149 --> 02:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
i was a plaintiff on league of women
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
voters at all versus william gardner at
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
all a case that fought against very
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
similar legislation to hb554
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
while i have massive respect for
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner i completely opposed
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
what he was trying to enforce
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
before the 2018 midterm elections
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
students in my position were
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
experiencing a bureaucratic nightmare
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
filled with confused administrators and
 
02:15:42.470 --> 02:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
town election officials it took me
 
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
personally 45 minutes in the goffstown
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
town offices to get registered despite
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
being the only person there because of
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
how confusing it was
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
if it was this difficult for me someone
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
who's politically engaged and willing to
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
take a large chunk of a monday morning
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
to testify before the legislature
 
02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
picture how many students who are
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps more apolitical must have
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
decided to call it quits on voting
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
this may sound like a good thing to some
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
people but a college or any institution
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
of learning as described by 554 may be

members of the committee
 
02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:55.110 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
this

02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
my intent
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh proposing this bill
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
is to do away with the system or at
 
02:18:06.230 --> 02:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
least originally it was to do away with
 
02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:18:11.509 --> 02:18:11.519 align:start position:0%
of affidavits and and i know uh
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative abramson who may be on
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
the line has
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
has i think suggested an amendment
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh to the bill which which
 
02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
would reintroduce the issue of
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
affidavits but i'll let me let me sort
 
02:18:24.469 --> 02:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
of go over
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
my original purpose first and then uh
 
02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:28.629 align:start position:0%
my original purpose first and then uh
um

02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
his uh suggestions i'm not particular
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not necessarily saying i'm opposed
 
02:18:34.950 --> 02:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
to them um in fact it may it may be that
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
they make that they make good sense but
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
let me sort of take a moment just to
 
02:18:39.910 --> 02:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
my what my original intention was in in
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
drafting this
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
as you know under current law
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
we have a what i would refer to as a
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
voter identification
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
we have voter identification
 
02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:54.469 align:start position:0%
we have voter identification
requirements

02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:18:54.479 --> 02:18:55.589 align:start position:0%
requirements
light

02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
light
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
and what i mean by that is that
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
various provisions that say you need to
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
provide identification
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
um you need to provide some form of
 
02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:08.070 align:start position:0%
um you need to provide some form of
proof

02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
proof
 
02:19:12.309 --> 02:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
of citizenship age and domicile
 
02:19:12.319 --> 02:19:13.270 align:start position:0%
of citizenship age and domicile
but

02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't have that proof then you
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
can just say so you can just swear that
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's true
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
even if you don't have that proof and
 
02:19:23.110 --> 02:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
this is particularly becomes a problem
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
where for people who are registering
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
uh on election day
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
so what this um
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
and under the current
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
what under the current law particularly
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
for people who are registering on
 
02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
election day
 
02:19:37.120 --> 02:19:37.990 align:start position:0%
election day
they

02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh they can say well look i don't have
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
any evidence of my domicile as an
 
02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:43.270 align:start position:0%
any evidence of my domicile as an
example

02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:19:45.750 --> 02:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and are permitted to vote
 
02:19:48.469 --> 02:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
and then the law sort of establishes a
 
02:19:48.479 --> 02:19:49.750 align:start position:0%
and then the law sort of establishes a
procedure

02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:50.790 align:start position:0%
procedure
whereby

02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
whereby
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
the the uh the secretary of state
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
is um is allowed to do some sort of
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
after the fact verification
 
02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:00.070 align:start position:0%
after the fact verification
um

02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:01.910 --> 02:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
in an effort to establish whether the
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
person is telling the truth uh was
 
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
telling the truth or not
 
02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:06.230 align:start position:0%
telling the truth or not
um

02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh it seems to me that that's very
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
awkward unlikely uh very
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh to be successful
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
um and and just uh
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
creates a huge hole
 
02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
in the voter identification system so
 
02:20:25.110 --> 02:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill is designed to do is to
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
say we're going to stop that
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
um there will be you don't you don't get
 
02:20:30.870 --> 02:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
to say
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
um as an alternative to providing the
 
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:34.230 align:start position:0%
um as an alternative to providing the
proof

02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
proof
 
02:20:35.590 --> 02:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh of the
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship age or domicile
 
02:20:42.150 --> 02:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh that uh simply an affidavit that's
 
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
that says i swear that that all those
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
things are true
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
rather you have to do those things
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
you have to provide the proof
 
02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
and uh particularly with respect to
 
02:20:53.439 --> 02:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
and uh particularly with respect to
domicile

02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
domicile
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
what it says is that if you come in
 
02:20:59.429 --> 02:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh within 30 days first of all if you
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
come in with
 
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
more than 30 days to register then then
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
you have to provide the documentation
 
02:21:07.349 --> 02:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have it at the time you
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
first come in then you can provide it
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
later but but before the the day of the
 
02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:13.110 align:start position:0%
later but but before the the day of the
uh

02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
of the election but what it's
 
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
particularly designed to cover is the
 
02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:18.309 align:start position:0%
particularly designed to cover is the
situation

02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
of someone who who arrives on election
 
02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:21.830 align:start position:0%
of someone who who arrives on election
day

02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
without any proof of uh to establish
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
those things
 
02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
and says i want to vote
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
under the under the proposal in my bill
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
what would happen is
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
the person would be permitted to cast
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
a provisional ballot
 
02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:38.870 align:start position:0%
a provisional ballot
um

02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
which would uh which would be clearly
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
identified which he would then put in a
 
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
he would go vote vote in secret put it
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
in an envelope
 
02:21:50.550 --> 02:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
um uh which would be sealed so nobody
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
would know who the person voted for
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
and then the person would have five days
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
after the election to provide the proof
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
that that the person
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
should have brought
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
to the election but didn't
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
if the person provides the proof
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
then the provisional ballot will be
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
counted will be opened and counted along
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
with the other ballots if the person
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
does not provide that proof
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
then then the person's ballot would not
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
be counted
 
02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:19.270 align:start position:0%
be counted
um

02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
i've done some research and you know
 
02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.910 align:start position:0%
i've done some research and you know
into

02:22:23.910 --> 02:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
voting laws and the constitutionality of
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
various provisions i think this
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
provision would be
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
would be completely constitutional as i
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
the u.s supreme court has said that
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
voter identification
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh laws and uh
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
are constitutional and and there doesn't
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
need to be something like
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know a provision where you can
 
02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:47.990 align:start position:0%
you know a provision where you can
simply

02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
if you can't provide the proof of the
 
02:22:52.469 --> 02:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
things that you need to provide
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
in order to establish your eligibility
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
to vote that you can simply swear that
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's true
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
and that's enough i think the supreme
 
02:22:59.439 --> 02:23:00.230 align:start position:0%
and that's enough i think the supreme
court

02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
court
 
02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:01.270 align:start position:0%
court
um

02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:02.389 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
has indicated that that that you know
 
02:23:06.070 --> 02:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
there there does not
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
um there does not need to be such
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh such an exception you can have voter
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
identification laws that actually have
 
02:23:15.750 --> 02:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
real teeth and it seems to me that
 
02:23:18.389 --> 02:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's all this bill does
 
02:23:21.270 --> 02:23:21.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and i i i think it makes sense
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i i hope that the committee will
 
02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:23.750 align:start position:0%
and i i hope that the committee will
agree

02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
and we'll uh will recommend it off to
 
02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
pass and i'm happy to take questions
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members in the
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
room questions from people online
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony on your
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill this morning
 
02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:48.469 align:start position:0%
bill this morning
uh

02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
i thought i saw a hand raised myself
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
wait a minute do i i i you know i sort
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
of do the right to left but you know
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
there are days the head doesn't go quite
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
so far as it probably could
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
so um is there any representative lane
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
there you go i see you now thank you
 
02:24:06.309 --> 02:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully you can hear me this time i
 
02:24:07.750 --> 02:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
think i
 
02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
think i
um

02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for taking my question uh
 
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
have you talked to the secretary of
 
02:24:16.870 --> 02:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
state uh about this bill because it
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
includes provisional ballots and is
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
something that historically we've not
 
02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
done in new hampshire
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
um and and gotten their input on this
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
i have not and i would and um
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
you know i i think that
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
getting the input of the secretary of
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
state would uh would would be a good
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
idea i have not i have i should say i
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
have heard
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
that um some people have expressed a
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
concern that the provisional ballots
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
would create um an issue because
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in the constitution
 
02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
i believe in the section dealing with
 
02:24:56.070 --> 02:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
the state senate if i'm if i'm
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
remembering correctly but i may be wrong
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
on that i think it's in the section
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with the state senate
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
about about votes being
 
02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:10.950 align:start position:0%
about about votes being
um

02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
on election day
 
02:25:14.469 --> 02:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
um and some suggestion that well this
 
02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know provisional ballots might
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
create a problem
 
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
um with that but
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that the provision
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
um is required to be read that way and
 
02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:27.510 align:start position:0%
um is required to be read that way and
and

02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
more importantly
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
if if you really had to have
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
the the complete outcome of the election
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
on election day and you could never
 
02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
do anything after election day then the
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
whole process of having recounts and the
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
whole and the provisions that we have in
 
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
the law allowing recounts
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
um and you know
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh just to uh
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
to change the result of an election if
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
there's been an error would not be
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
allowed and and and clearly the law does
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
allow that so i i don't think that
 
02:26:00.160 --> 02:26:01.110 align:start position:0%
allow that so i i don't think that
um

02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:03.830 --> 02:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
that that the use of provisional ballots
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
which would
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know which would would uh
 
02:26:10.550 --> 02:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
allow the the the final results of an
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
election to be delayed by no more than
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
five days which is
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
probably less than
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
than uh the delay that's caused by the
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
typical recount
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
um would would uh
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
would bring into question the
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
constitutionality all right
 
02:26:28.389 --> 02:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mooney thank
 
02:26:28.399 --> 02:26:30.309 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mooney thank
you

02:26:30.309 --> 02:26:30.319 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative but your answer to the
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
last question pretty much covered my
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
question so i'm going to withdraw my
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
request for a question thank you
 
02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative murhead
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm just wondering
 
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
if you you have data on
 
02:26:50.710 --> 02:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
how many um
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
affidavits are are used in a in an
 
02:26:56.469 --> 02:26:56.479 align:start position:0%
ordinary election season
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't i really do not have
 
02:27:02.150 --> 02:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh that information all i mean other
 
02:27:04.150 --> 02:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
than really very
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
in a very vague sort of uh you know
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotal way i've heard a number of
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
people say that
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
that there are too many of those but but
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
you know if you ask me for any detail i
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
have to say honestly i don't have that
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
any detail
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
further question something on that one
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%

we are
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
talking about hb 531 and we are
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
eliminating testimony this morning to
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
about a minute and a half so thank you
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair and members
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh i wish to speak against
 
02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:03.910 align:start position:0%
uh i wish to speak against
the

02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill proposed by my friend bob lynn um
 
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
he's eloquent as usual but i think that
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
what his bill fails to take account of
 
02:28:15.429 --> 02:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
is the
 
02:28:15.439 --> 02:28:16.309 align:start position:0%
is the
um

02:28:16.309 --> 02:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:19.830 --> 02:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
the reality that i've seen in
 
02:28:22.230 --> 02:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
the many elections where i have been a
 
02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
poll watcher
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
and the provisional affidavits have and
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
provisional ballots and the affidavits
 
02:28:32.710 --> 02:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
have worked just fine it was seamless it
 
02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
was not uh it didn't seem to me anyway
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
to be in any way burdensome to
 
02:28:40.150 --> 02:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
the clerks
 
02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:41.990 align:start position:0%
the clerks
it

02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
people who came to register for the
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
first time at the polling place were
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
able to do that people who did not have
 
02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
the ids that were necessary
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
they got a provisional ballot they
 
02:28:57.750 --> 02:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
signed the affidavit and they went and
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
voted didn't hold anything up it was a
 
02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.270 align:start position:0%
voted didn't hold anything up it was a
perfectly

02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
fine process
 
02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
the the votes were counted so i
 
02:29:09.510 --> 02:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
if it ain't broke i don't know why we
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
would try to fix it
 
02:29:16.230 --> 02:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
um having said that
 
02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
um having said that
i

02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:18.309 align:start position:0%
i
also

02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
there is
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality
 
02:29:25.670 --> 02:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the or possible lack of
 
02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:27.510 align:start position:0%
of the or possible lack of
constitutionality

02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionality
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
that representative lin was talking
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
about is
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh not doesn't even become
 
02:29:36.389 --> 02:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
relevant if
 
02:29:36.399 --> 02:29:37.270 align:start position:0%
relevant if
uh

02:29:37.270 --> 02:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
if if
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
this works he says it's constitutional
 
02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it is
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
but in any event i don't see why you
 
02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
would disenfranchise people
 
02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
who show up at the polls and
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh god knows all of us have at one time
 
02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
or another forgotten our
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know our health insurance card
 
02:29:59.590 --> 02:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
or our
 
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
credit card or
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
whatever it is a driver's license uh
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere out in the car
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
maybe in your glove compartment and you
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
know here you are after waiting in line
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
you're at the front of the line and you
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
don't have it with you i don't know it's
 
02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:16.870 align:start position:0%
don't have it with you i don't know it's
it's

02:30:16.870 --> 02:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
really doesn't seem to be
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
a problem in need of fixing and i think
 
02:30:24.389 --> 02:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative lynn checked that did the
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
last question asked about numbers i
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
think if you check the numbers are not
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
all that uh great
 
02:30:34.389 --> 02:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
that they would have
 
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
swayed any elections
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr barnes if you could wrap up
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%

of the committee
uh

02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
this bill poses as a fair bill and it
 
02:31:57.910 --> 02:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
pretends to put an end to unfounded
 
02:31:59.670 --> 02:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
allegations of voter fraud in new
 
02:31:59.680 --> 02:32:00.870 align:start position:0%
allegations of voter fraud in new
hampshire

02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
the problem i have with it is there is
 
02:32:05.030 --> 02:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
no voter fraud in new hampshire and the
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions to it seeks to impose are
 
02:32:08.120 --> 02:32:09.670 align:start position:0%
restrictions to it seeks to impose are
unconstitutional

02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
02:32:11.590 --> 02:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
if you pass this bill there will be a
 
02:32:13.270 --> 02:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
number of lawsuits that should tie this
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
up in court this is a clear abusive
 
02:32:18.309 --> 02:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
legislative power and i urge you to
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%

02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
quickly but there are a number of points
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
worth making because this bill is a big
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill that has a lot
 
02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
so the first thing that this bill does
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
is it would eliminate the qualified
 
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
voter affidavit which is used by people
 
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
who are
 
02:33:38.710 --> 02:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
proving identity age or citizenship when
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
they're registering to vote uh according
 
02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
to a right to know request then that i
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
got from the secretary of state's office
 
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
and in response to representative
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
meerhead's question
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
on november 3rd 2020
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
637 people used this affidavit to prove
 
02:33:56.870 --> 02:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
identity and 816 people use this
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
affidavit approved citizenship
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
and the secretary of state's office does
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
not count the number of people who use
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
this identity affidavit to prove age so
 
02:34:08.630 --> 02:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's 1400 people
 
02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
who registered on november 14th who did
 
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
not have the requisite documents to
 
02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:14.710 align:start position:0%
not have the requisite documents to
prove

02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
prove
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
one of the qualifications and so had to
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
rely on this affidavit and who would not
 
02:34:20.469 --> 02:34:20.479 align:start position:0%
have been able to vote
 
02:34:21.910 --> 02:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
were this bill
 
02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:23.510 align:start position:0%
were this bill
law

02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
in response to the constitutionality of
 
02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
in response to the constitutionality of
this

02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
provision i think there's
 
02:34:30.630 --> 02:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's a really important question and
 
02:34:32.550 --> 02:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
not an open question
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
in uh over the summer in fish versus
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
schwab the 10th circuit considered a
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
very similar documentary proof of
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
citizenship regime in some ways it was
 
02:34:45.270 --> 02:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
actually more
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry less restrictive than this
 
02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:47.830 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry less restrictive than this
bill

02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and ruled that that statute was
 
02:34:51.670 --> 02:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional under the anderson
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
burdick framework and then the us
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
supreme court declined to review
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
that determination
 
02:35:00.550 --> 02:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh just this summer with the the current
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
composition of the court and and
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
basically the reason for that is
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
under this law
 
02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who doesn't have a passport
 
02:35:09.990 --> 02:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
birth certificate or naturalization
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
papers with them would not be able to
 
02:35:14.150 --> 02:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
register to vote because there's no
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
other proof of citizenship that's
 
02:35:18.070 --> 02:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
commonly available
 
02:35:19.590 --> 02:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
and there are there's just a lot of
 
02:35:21.349 --> 02:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
people who don't have that documentation
 
02:35:23.830 --> 02:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
and they would be prohibited from voting
 
02:35:25.830 --> 02:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
turning next to the provisional ballots
 
02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:27.270 align:start position:0%
turning next to the provisional ballots
piece

02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
piece
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
which was discussed a little bit by
 
02:35:32.150 --> 02:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative lynn the prime sponsor
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
i attached in my written testimony for
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
you a brief from the secretary of state
 
02:35:38.469 --> 02:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
and attorney general where they
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
discussed their belief that part two
 
02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
article 32 would prohibit
 
02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think by fair inference provisional
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
ballots there was a case uh brought over
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
the summer aft versus gardner seeking to
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
extend the deadline for receipt of
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots from must be received
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
by election data must be postmarked by
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
election day and basically what the
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general and secretary of state
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
told the superior court judge just like
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
six months ago is that they believe that
 
02:36:07.670 --> 02:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
violates the state constitution which
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
requires that all votes be countable and
 
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
counted on election day
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
um and so i think the same logic would
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
would show
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
that creating provisional ballots
 
02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
would be unconstitutional under part 2
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
article 32.
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
another important point about it thank
 
02:36:26.630 --> 02:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
you mr clementowitz if you can wrap up i
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
did recall that you submitted written
 
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and we have received it thank
 
02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:30.710 align:start position:0%
testimony and we have received it thank
you

02:36:30.710 --> 02:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
i appreciate i i'm just going to make if
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
i made two two points and i'll make them
 
02:36:36.309 --> 02:36:36.319 align:start position:0%
very quickly
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
in addition the provisional ballots
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
and provisional registration i think
 
02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
puts new hampshire's exemption from the
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
national voter registration
 
02:36:46.950 --> 02:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
act at risk which is if you look at the
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note a concern raised by the
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state as well
 
02:36:52.790 --> 02:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
because our exemption is premised upon
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
there being a state law in effect since
 
02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
1993 that allows every person to
 
02:36:59.349 --> 02:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
register on election day and i think
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
there's a open question whether the
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
justice department under this
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
administration would find provisional
 
02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:05.670 align:start position:0%
administration would find provisional
ballots

02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
um prevent some people from registering
 
02:37:09.190 --> 02:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
and thus would cause us to lose our
 
02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
and thus would cause us to lose our
exemption

02:37:10.230 --> 02:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
and make us have to comply with motor
 
02:37:14.950 --> 02:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
voter and i know the committee is
 
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
very familiar with all that that entails
 
02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
and then the final point and again i'll
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
make this as quick as i can
 
02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:22.230 align:start position:0%
make this as quick as i can
is

02:37:22.230 --> 02:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:37:23.830 --> 02:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
this would this bill would completely
 
02:37:26.230 --> 02:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
change the way that challenged voters
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
are dealt with by um making it so that
 
02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
are dealt with by um making it so that
if

02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh a moderator deems well founded any
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
challenge no longer will a person be
 
02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
able to vote there's no provision for
 
02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
due process for
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
presentation of evidence an opportunity
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
to be heard an opportunity to go to
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
court and any case where a person is
 
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
just straight up prohibited from voting
 
02:37:49.429 --> 02:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
if they're eligible to vote i think
 
02:37:50.309 --> 02:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh struck down by court very quickly
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
because obviously you have a fundamental
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to vote and so i
 
02:37:56.479 --> 02:37:57.349 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to vote and so i
think

02:37:57.349 --> 02:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:37:59.590 --> 02:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
that the procedural safeguards in place
 
02:38:02.230 --> 02:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
there are are completely inadequate and
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
um so those are the the three reasons
 
02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
why i think that this bill would violate
 
02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
the state and federal constitution and
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take questions thank you
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
for your indulgence madam
 
02:38:20.469 --> 02:38:20.479 align:start position:0%

02:39:14.630 --> 02:39:14.640 align:start position:0%

from franklin new hampshire where a pro
voter pro-voter

02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
voter pro-voter
 
02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
pro-democracy organization and i am a
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
registered lobbyist
 
02:39:30.309 --> 02:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
i have concerns that this bill ends
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
same-day registration as i understand it
 
02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:33.750 align:start position:0%
same-day registration as i understand it
and

02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:35.910 --> 02:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
in true new hampshire fashion new
 
02:39:37.830 --> 02:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire picked same-day registration
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
because it was the cheapest option
 
02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
because it was the cheapest option
and

02:39:41.750 --> 02:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the 1993
 
02:39:46.469 --> 02:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
passage of the national voter right act
 
02:39:46.479 --> 02:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
passage of the national voter right act
does

02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:39:49.270 --> 02:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
have forced new hampshire to choose
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
either having the same day
 
02:39:54.230 --> 02:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
provisions or motor vote voter
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
and i think this committee has debated
 
02:39:57.910 --> 02:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
this for a long time and decided that
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
same-day registration is the thing
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
that is the best
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
um this bill also ends the practice to
 
02:40:08.550 --> 02:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
sign sworn affidavit
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
you have seen a superior court judge
 
02:40:14.389 --> 02:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
strike some of these burdensome
 
02:40:14.399 --> 02:40:15.349 align:start position:0%
strike some of these burdensome
or

02:40:15.349 --> 02:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know any any other burdensome
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
documentation for registering to vote
 
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
and i would urge you
 
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
i know that that court is that case is
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
still being litigated and i urge you not
 
02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
to make any changes um to these
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
affidavits until after that procedure
 
02:40:32.469 --> 02:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
has finished
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
also house bill 30 531
 
02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
allows for provisional ballots
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
i urge the committee to read new
 
02:40:41.990 --> 02:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution part 2 article
 
02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:43.349 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution part 2 article
32.

02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
32.
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
the piece of this is that all ballots
 
02:40:48.550 --> 02:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
must be counted in a public meeting
 
02:40:51.030 --> 02:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
um after all the ballots are closed the
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
moderator calls to end the
 
02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:55.830 align:start position:0%
moderator calls to end the
the

02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
close the polls
 
02:40:59.910 --> 02:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
um my understanding if you pass this
 
02:41:02.309 --> 02:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
you'll require moderators to keep pull
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
that continuous meeting for five days
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's hard enough to find good
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
moderators and selectmen
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
and other people but if you require them
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
to sit there for five days until people
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
prove um their identity i think that it
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
will be very hard for you to find poll
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
workers willing to do that
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and for many other reasons i hope you
 
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
vote inexpedient to legislate on house
 
02:41:30.389 --> 02:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony does
 
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%

are matt sharon and fellow committee
 
02:42:43.190 --> 02:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
members today came before you to
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
introduce hb 535 which would eliminate
 
02:42:48.630 --> 02:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
the qualified voter half david
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
as i've spoke about our election laws
 
02:42:54.309 --> 02:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
many times before
 
02:42:56.389 --> 02:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
i still want to go over the record for
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
the record what it takes for someone to
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
save they register in the state of new
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and the requirements for
 
02:43:04.230 --> 02:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
someone to do so
 
02:43:06.070 --> 02:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire someone may legally
 
02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
vote here who has been in the state for
 
02:43:09.429 --> 02:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
30 seconds as new hampshire has no
 
02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
durational requirements to vote
 
02:43:13.270 --> 02:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
all they have to do is walk into a
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
polling location on election day and
 
02:43:16.950 --> 02:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
register to vote when they register to
 
02:43:18.309 --> 02:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
vote they currently do not have to
 
02:43:20.309 --> 02:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
present any photo id or proof of
 
02:43:22.710 --> 02:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
domicile the way they get around it
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
having to show a photo id is with a
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
qualified voter affidavit put it more
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
simply do not actually know who they are
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
when they register to vote because they
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to produce any proof that
 
02:43:35.030 --> 02:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
they are who they say they are
 
02:43:37.270 --> 02:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
this bill will in effect make the voter
 
02:43:39.910 --> 02:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
showing photo id to in some way prove
 
02:43:42.630 --> 02:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:45.429 --> 02:43:45.439 align:start position:0%
as to the issue of requiring an id i
 
02:43:47.750 --> 02:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
went to talk about my own experience
 
02:43:49.590 --> 02:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
after graduating college i moved 11
 
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
times in five years despite being
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
employed the whole time and jobs that
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
often required me to work long hours
 
02:43:57.750 --> 02:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
i've always managed to have an id
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
the notion that having an id is a burden
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
is thin to say the least you need a
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
photo id to fly on a plane open a bank
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
account buy alcohol drive a car get
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
married rent a hotel room and even
 
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
purchase cold medicine
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
to put it bluntly unless you never leave
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
your house which you would also need an
 
02:44:19.190 --> 02:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
id to rent or get a mortgage
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
and never get sick you need a photo id
 
02:44:25.830 --> 02:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
hp 535 does not offer the type of does
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
not alter the type of id you would
 
02:44:30.630 --> 02:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
accept i'm sure some detractors will say
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
that this bill it will somehow attempt
 
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
to affect the college vote but college
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
students can would still be able to use
 
02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
their out-of-state photo id to register
 
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
they may they may still register on
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
election day and they would still not
 
02:44:47.269 --> 02:44:47.279 align:start position:0%
have to provide any proof of domicile
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
in fact i would
 
02:44:52.309 --> 02:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
positively increase voter turnout by
 
02:44:54.150 --> 02:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
restoring faith in our elections to
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
those who currently have serious doubt
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
as to about our elections
 
02:45:00.870 --> 02:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
i will remind the committee that in the
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
latest saint anthony poll 36
 
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire voters did not select a
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
very confident option as to the absolute
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
confidence in the integrity of our
 
02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:12.710 align:start position:0%
confidence in the integrity of our
election

02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
as i said to put it in layman's terms 36
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
percent of new hampshire residents are
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
not very confident in our elections in
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
fact 17
 
02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
said they were not at all confident in
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
the integrity of our elections so nearly
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
one-fifth of our citizens have zero
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
faith in our elections
 
02:45:31.349 --> 02:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
just last week we heard from an
 
02:45:33.269 --> 02:45:33.279 align:start position:0%
immigrant and newly invented citizen
 
02:45:35.429 --> 02:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
that she was disheartened to vote in her
 
02:45:37.830 --> 02:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
first election due to our election laws
 
02:45:39.990 --> 02:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
that provide zero accountability
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
the right to vote is sacred but so is
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
having faith in the outcome of that vote
 
02:45:46.950 --> 02:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents deserve to know
 
02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
who is voting in their elections and
 
02:45:50.550 --> 02:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would accomplish that while
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
not preventing any real barrier to the
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
ballot box
 
02:45:57.750 --> 02:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barry for rep
 
02:45:59.349 --> 02:45:59.359 align:start position:0%

02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative barry
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
here in the committee room
 
02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
or attending online
 
02:46:09.510 --> 02:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
i do
 
02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
oh see now i'm looking i've got the
 
02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
raised hand but not the visual
 
02:46:15.269 --> 02:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chair representative

fraud uh related to these affidavits
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:33.910 --> 02:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
walked in can you can you hear me now
 
02:46:35.910 --> 02:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it was very muffled
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry in 2016 a man in lebanon
 
02:46:41.750 --> 02:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire walked in to register to
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
vote he voted he walked out of the form
 
02:46:46.309 --> 02:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
location came back two to three hours
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
later with a blonde wig on and
 
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
registered to vote to leave using what i
 
02:46:52.309 --> 02:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
believe was the qualified voter
 
02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit because they did not have an
 
02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up please sure
 
02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
was this reported to the secretary of
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
state or the ag's office yes i believe
 
02:47:09.510 --> 02:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
it was prosecuted but only because the
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
individual for some reason after the
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
election attempted to attain an id based
 
02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
on the new identity
 
02:47:19.269 --> 02:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
so it was a it was a fluke that we found
 
02:47:20.060 --> 02:47:20.070 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:21.590 align:start position:0%

02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up the person did cast two
 
02:47:32.319 --> 02:47:33.590 align:start position:0%
follow-up the person did cast two
ballots

02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
02:47:33.600 --> 02:47:34.550 align:start position:0%
ballots

very briefly respectful of your time
 
02:48:33.750 --> 02:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
the bill seems to be premised on some
 
02:48:37.190 --> 02:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
polls that talk about confidence in our
 
02:48:38.950 --> 02:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
elections and
 
02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't
 
02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:41.190 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't
base

02:48:41.190 --> 02:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
base
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
state legislation on the results of
 
02:48:46.550 --> 02:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
polls which are notoriously unreliable
 
02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
and depend on the questions asked and
 
02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
people could lack confidence in our
 
02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:51.429 align:start position:0%
people could lack confidence in our
elections

02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:48:53.830 --> 02:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
for a hundred different reasons
 
02:48:53.840 --> 02:48:54.630 align:start position:0%
for a hundred different reasons
and

02:48:54.630 --> 02:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's not clear that this is the one
 
02:49:01.590 --> 02:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's all i will
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
reserve my time or
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%

clementowitz i'm assuming on behalf of
 
02:49:30.230 --> 02:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
the aclu i believe we did receive
 
02:49:32.230 --> 02:49:32.240 align:start position:0%

the house election law committee again
 
02:49:44.070 --> 02:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh henry clementowicz on behalf of the
 
02:49:46.550 --> 02:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
ac new hampshire
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
so this bill i'm i'll be brief because a
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
lot of this bill
 
02:49:52.630 --> 02:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
is included in this
 
02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
raises some of the same issues as hb 531
 
02:49:59.269 --> 02:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
um as i said before in in that hearing
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
in fish versus schwab the 10th circuit
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
from the summer uh struck down on
 
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional grounds a kansas law that
 
02:50:08.469 --> 02:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
required people to have documentary
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
proof of citizenship when they were
 
02:50:12.469 --> 02:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
trying to register to vote much like
 
02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh the provision in this law um
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
i want to respond briefly to something
 
02:50:19.190 --> 02:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
that was made by uh the time sponsor a
 
02:50:21.190 --> 02:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
point that was made which is um there
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
are much fewer
 
02:50:22.800 --> 02:50:23.590 align:start position:0%
are much fewer
um

02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:26.150 --> 02:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
documents that are available to prove
 
02:50:28.150 --> 02:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
citizenship than there are
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
photo ids right so when a person
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
registers to vote they have to prove
 
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship age domicile and identity
 
02:50:37.349 --> 02:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
and the documents that come to mind that
 
02:50:39.269 --> 02:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
i can think of that prove citizenship
 
02:50:41.110 --> 02:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
are limited to birth certificate
 
02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:42.469 align:start position:0%
are limited to birth certificate
passport

02:50:42.469 --> 02:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
passport
 
02:50:42.479 --> 02:50:43.510 align:start position:0%
passport
um

02:50:43.510 --> 02:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:45.110 --> 02:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
and naturalization papers and so a
 
02:50:46.389 --> 02:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
driver's license a new hampshire
 
02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license for example does not
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
prove citizenship because you don't need
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
to be a citizen to get a new hampshire
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license i mean so people with
 
02:50:56.630 --> 02:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
only a driver's license under this bill
 
02:50:58.710 --> 02:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
would not be able to register to vote
 
02:51:00.469 --> 02:51:00.479 align:start position:0%
and to vote and so again i just wanted
 
02:51:00.479 --> 02:51:02.070 align:start position:0%
and to vote and so again i just wanted
to

02:51:02.070 --> 02:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:51:03.830 --> 02:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
point out to the committee
 
02:51:07.510 --> 02:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
in on november 3rd 2020 over 800 people
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire used the qualified
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
voter affidavit to prove citizenship
 
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
presumably because they didn't have
 
02:51:16.389 --> 02:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
other proof of citizenship when they
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
registered to vote and so those 800
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
something people would be
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised as would the about 637
 
02:51:26.309 --> 02:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
who use the affidavit to prove identity
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
when registered vote and then finally i
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
i meant to mention this in the last
 
02:51:31.590 --> 02:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
hearing but i'll mention it now
 
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
a right to know request response from
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
02:51:37.349 --> 02:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
tells me that
 
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
as of
 
02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:41.670 align:start position:0%
as of
friday

02:51:41.670 --> 02:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:44.469 --> 02:51:44.479 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office out of the
 
02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
over 1 million votes that were cast in
 
02:51:49.750 --> 02:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
the september 8th and november 3rd 2020
 
02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
primaries has opened up investigations
 
02:51:55.269 --> 02:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
into only 17
 
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh potential wrongful voting cases and
 
02:51:59.750 --> 02:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
has brought so far
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
zero civil or criminal proceedings
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
in relation to alleged wrongful voting
 
02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
stemming from those elections so
 
02:52:06.960 --> 02:52:07.830 align:start position:0%
stemming from those elections so
um

02:52:07.830 --> 02:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:09.269 --> 02:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
on the one hand
 
02:52:12.469 --> 02:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
this um law would seek to prevent uh
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
stop fraud which uh we know is
 
02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
vanishingly rare and in fact only 17
 
02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
cases have even been investigated and on
 
02:52:22.710 --> 02:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
the other hand it would it would prevent
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
about 1400 people from being able to
 
02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
register to vote um on election day so
 
02:52:29.269 --> 02:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony and i'm
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh questions if there are any
 
02:52:35.510 --> 02:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members in the
 
02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:36.870 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members in the
room

02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:52:40.870 --> 02:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:42.150 --> 02:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative murray was that a
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
question or was that a
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
pen wave okay
 
02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279 align:start position:0%

02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:01.910 --> 02:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh hi good morning members of the
 
02:53:03.349 --> 02:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
committee again madam chairwoman my name
 
02:53:05.349 --> 02:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
is lucas meyer again for the record i
 
02:53:06.550 --> 02:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
live in manchester new hampshire
 
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
testifying um as a citizen
 
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
um here in uh opposition uh to hb
 
02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh 535 again not to belabor the point
 
02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
brought up by uh uh henry clowitz um
 
02:53:23.590 --> 02:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
but again a a qualified voter affidavit
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
form is a legally binding form uh this
 
02:53:28.389 --> 02:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill appears to be
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
a solution in search of a problem um
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislating based off lies of voter
 
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
fraud or very infrequent cases of voter
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
error should not be
 
02:53:40.469 --> 02:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
how we want to it
 
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
how we change how our elections are
 
02:53:45.269 --> 02:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
administered um this bill um certainly
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh would target new americans uh who do
 
02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
not have their naturalization papers
 
02:53:51.990 --> 02:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore will not be able to
 
02:53:54.389 --> 02:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
register to vote um i also think it's
 
02:53:56.870 --> 02:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
important to remember that if a person
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
registers to vote on election day
 
02:54:01.110 --> 02:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
without an id they are already having
 
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
their picture taken as an additional
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
security step and if this committee is
 
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
serious about
 
02:54:09.190 --> 02:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
catching cases of
 
02:54:11.110 --> 02:54:11.120 align:start position:0%
voter error or
 
02:54:12.309 --> 02:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
the very
 
02:54:14.710 --> 02:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
rare instances of voter fraud
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
they should look towards the electronic
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
registration information center
 
02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
which would
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
catch those cases of voter error weeks
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
after the election
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
and i will leave it at that thank you
 
02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%

02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
if a person registers to vote on
 
02:54:41.910 --> 02:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
election day without an id as the law
 
02:54:43.510 --> 02:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
currently stands their picture will be
 
02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:47.190 align:start position:0%
currently stands their picture will be
taken

02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:47.200 align:start position:0%

i am
 
02:55:39.750 --> 02:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
i live in alton bay and open democracy
 
02:55:41.830 --> 02:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
action works on pro-democracy issues
 
02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
including the protection of our inherent
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
american freedom to vote
 
02:55:50.630 --> 02:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
filing and a qualified voter affidavit
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
does not mean you get a free pass
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office follows up
 
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
with a letter asking the voter to submit
 
02:55:59.190 --> 02:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
the required documentation and follows
 
02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:00.070 align:start position:0%
the required documentation and follows
up

02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:00.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:56:01.590 --> 02:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
followed up if necessary by an
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
investigator from the ag's office
 
02:56:06.230 --> 02:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
if you don't provide this documentation
 
02:56:08.550 --> 02:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
you can receive a substantial fine if
 
02:56:10.630 --> 02:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
you provide fraudulent information you
 
02:56:12.550 --> 02:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
can be penalized with a five thousand
 
02:56:15.269 --> 02:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
dollar fine not a small factor and it
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
would seem more prudent and patriotic
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh to leave uh the qualified voter
 
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
affidavit intact let our citizens vote
 
02:56:26.230 --> 02:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
and properly fund the attorney general's
 
02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
office to do a thorough follow-up uh
 
02:56:31.190 --> 02:56:31.200 align:start position:0%
with these voters removing the provision
 
02:56:33.429 --> 02:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
for qualified voter affidavits plainly
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
makes voting more difficult and during
 
02:56:39.030 --> 02:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
the 2020 general election open democracy
 
02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
fielded 90 poll observers around the
 
02:56:43.429 --> 02:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
state reports from our observers
 
02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
indicated that huge numbers of
 
02:56:48.309 --> 02:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
people from both parties registered same
 
02:56:51.429 --> 02:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
day as attorney clementowitz noted the
 
02:56:54.630 --> 02:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
number of people using the uh qualified
 
02:56:57.429 --> 02:56:57.439 align:start position:0%
voter affidavits was very small weighing
 
02:56:59.910 --> 02:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
the number of people who in both parties
 
02:57:02.389 --> 02:57:02.399 align:start position:0%
who use this method and
 
02:57:05.030 --> 02:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
the few that need the affidavit it would
 
02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
seem that this bill would hurt more
 
02:57:08.710 --> 02:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
voters than it would add to election
 
02:57:11.670 --> 02:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
integrity so i respectfully ask that you
 
02:57:15.190 --> 02:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
vote hb 535 in expedia to legislate and
 
02:57:16.790 --> 02:57:16.800 align:start position:0%

02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
say something deputy scanlon
 
02:57:55.429 --> 02:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair for the record
 
02:57:57.269 --> 02:57:57.279 align:start position:0%
i'm david scanlon deputy secretary of
 
02:57:59.510 --> 02:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
state and i just wanted to address a
 
02:58:00.790 --> 02:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
question that was posed to
 
02:58:04.309 --> 02:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative perdom o'brien a about
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
when a
 
02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
photo was taken
 
02:58:09.110 --> 02:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
currently there are no photos taken of
 
02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
voters registering to vote using an
 
02:58:13.110 --> 02:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
affidavit although there is a bill
 
02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
currently pending before your committee
 
02:58:15.990 --> 02:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
provide for that the only time that a
 
02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
photo is taken in the polling place
 
02:58:23.190 --> 02:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
when a voter signs an affidavit is when
 
02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
there is a voter that is
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
that does not have an acceptable form of
 
02:58:26.880 --> 02:58:27.990 align:start position:0%
that does not have an acceptable form of
id

02:58:27.990 --> 02:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
id
 
02:58:29.750 --> 02:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
and to meet the requirement they have to
 
02:58:32.070 --> 02:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
fill out a challenge photo david and
 
02:58:33.910 --> 02:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
have their photo taken
 
02:58:35.830 --> 02:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
but that does not happen at the voter
 
02:58:38.070 --> 02:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
registration table
 
02:58:39.590 --> 02:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you question deputy scanlan
 
02:58:41.349 --> 02:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
because that's what we're talking about
 
02:58:43.269 --> 02:58:43.279 align:start position:0%
voters who are already registered and
 
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
forget to bring their id to the poll is
 
02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:58:50.710 --> 02:58:50.720 align:start position:0%

02:59:10.550 --> 02:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anybody so
 
02:59:12.630 --> 02:59:12.640 align:start position:0%

representative horrigan i think you're
 
02:59:54.150 --> 02:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the land of panelists there
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
you are go go ahead oh thank you so i
 
02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%

represent stratford county district six
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
the towns of durham and madbury and
 
03:00:04.950 --> 03:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
durham is not this is not coincidentally
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
a college town is
 
03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
i don't need to remind you it's hp 538
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
is a combination of two bills which i
 
03:00:12.870 --> 03:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
sponsored uh with many co-sponsors in
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
2019 they
 
03:00:16.389 --> 03:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
passed both houses and then were vetoed
 
03:00:18.070 --> 03:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
by the governor which um well i think
 
03:00:20.150 --> 03:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
that was a mistake in his part
 
03:00:21.429 --> 03:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:00:24.230 --> 03:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
one of these bills hp 106 also covered
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
the same ground as hb67 which
 
03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
suffered the same
 
03:00:30.710 --> 03:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
same fate it was also passed by both
 
03:00:32.950 --> 03:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
houses and veto but that was then this
 
03:00:34.710 --> 03:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
is now i actually
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
brought those two backs in 2020 but
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
nothing you know they
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
got to the house and then they kind of
 
03:00:41.590 --> 03:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
got lost in the
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
got lost when the pandemic struck us um
 
03:00:46.790 --> 03:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
so they were but we're back um i decided
 
03:00:49.990 --> 03:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
to combine them two bills into one
 
03:00:53.110 --> 03:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
hb 106 which is also hb 1279 the next
 
03:00:55.030 --> 03:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
year is at the end of the very long bill
 
03:00:56.870 --> 03:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
before the committee today it
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
section 16 out of 18. makes
 
03:01:02.230 --> 03:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of it hp 105 which is also hp
 
03:01:05.349 --> 03:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
1653 i says here makes up the first 15
 
03:01:07.110 --> 03:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
sections actually it was one for 15 and
 
03:01:08.790 --> 03:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
then also uh
 
03:01:11.590 --> 03:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
17 one before the enabling clause
 
03:01:13.349 --> 03:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
is a provision allowing
 
03:01:15.830 --> 03:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
what they call havo funds to be used by
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office to pay
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
for some of the things that the bill
 
03:01:22.790 --> 03:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh voter registration so the
 
03:01:25.349 --> 03:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is undo three uh earlier
 
03:01:25.359 --> 03:01:26.389 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is undo three uh earlier
bills

03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
bills
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
which unfairly restrict voting rights
 
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
generally make the voting process less
 
03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
user friendly or to put away more user
 
03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:33.279 align:start position:0%
hostile and just generally more
 
03:01:35.750 --> 03:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
complicated so those three
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
built very bad builds for hb 1264 which
 
03:01:42.950 --> 03:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
passed in 2018 sb3 which passed in 2017
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then also there was sb 318 which
 
03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
passed in 2012 and um
 
03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
one comma roman numeral one which we
 
03:01:59.110 --> 03:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
were discussing earlier um
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's also affected by this but we're
 
03:02:03.349 --> 03:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
adding a line to the end of it
 
03:02:05.830 --> 03:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
which says a person's claim of domicile
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
for voting purposes and not being
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
conclusive for the person's residence
 
03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
for any other legal purpose which is
 
03:02:12.230 --> 03:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
mostly trying to uh
 
03:02:13.990 --> 03:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
undo some of the confusion about things
 
03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
like driver's licenses and vehicle
 
03:02:17.590 --> 03:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
registration a bunch of other things
 
03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:18.710 align:start position:0%
registration a bunch of other things
which

03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:02:19.830 --> 03:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
don't have anything really to do with
 
03:02:20.950 --> 03:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
the right to vote you know you don't
 
03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
have to own a car or
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
you never driver's licenses etc but
 
03:02:27.190 --> 03:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
which always get mixed up in that issue
 
03:02:30.230 --> 03:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
so that's uh
 
03:02:32.790 --> 03:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
just um these bad laws that we passed
 
03:02:35.830 --> 03:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
between 2012 and 2018 don't just affect
 
03:02:38.550 --> 03:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
students but um my constituents in
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
durham which is a college town
 
03:02:42.389 --> 03:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
justifiably perceived these changes as
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
an attack on students right to vote so
 
03:02:47.030 --> 03:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
every citizen over the age of 18 has the
 
03:02:48.790 --> 03:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
right to vote anywhere he or she lives
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
um regardless of why he or she moved
 
03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
there and regardless of how long ago and
 
03:02:55.030 --> 03:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
it's not the people in the college towns
 
03:02:58.070 --> 03:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
who are so worried about students voting
 
03:02:59.910 --> 03:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's usually people from towns that have
 
03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know don't have colleges so we're
 
03:03:01.680 --> 03:03:02.870 align:start position:0%
you know don't have colleges so we're
usually

03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
usually
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
i found this in in other college
 
03:03:05.910 --> 03:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
communities they're usually pretty
 
03:03:08.309 --> 03:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
welcoming of uh students who want to get
 
03:03:10.309 --> 03:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
involved and want to vote so activists
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know the active
 
03:03:13.750 --> 03:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know the non-student activities is
 
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
usually glad to have the students um
 
03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
voting and doing other things it's um so
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's usually the problem is usually
 
03:03:21.429 --> 03:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
outside these towns so that's uh
 
03:03:23.670 --> 03:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
just protects the right to vote i think
 
03:03:25.030 --> 03:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
03:03:26.710 --> 03:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
i think the uh i think we should give
 
03:03:28.230 --> 03:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
the governor a chance to correct the
 
03:03:31.110 --> 03:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
mistake he made back in 2019 and um so i
 
03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
heard uh obviously they'll take a
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort but uh i urge the
 
03:03:38.230 --> 03:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
community here's the committee to
 
03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
pass hp 538 and it basically just
 
03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
just simplifies
 
03:03:44.309 --> 03:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
this makes the whole issue a little less
 
03:03:45.910 --> 03:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
complicated right now i think the law is
 
03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:46.870 align:start position:0%
complicated right now i think the law is
pretty

03:03:46.870 --> 03:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:03:48.950 --> 03:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
pretty convoluted and it will be kind of
 
03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
convoluted yep this passes but it will
 
03:03:52.870 --> 03:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
be a little bit simpler and fairer and
 
03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:53.750 align:start position:0%
be a little bit simpler and fairer and
just

03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:03:55.349 --> 03:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
more workable for everyone else so
 
03:03:56.950 --> 03:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's basically what i have to say
 
03:04:00.150 --> 03:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
about my bill and i guess i know we're
 
03:04:02.070 --> 03:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
already uh
 
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
about exactly an hour behind schedule
 
03:04:06.070 --> 03:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
which actually is not as bad as i feared
 
03:04:07.429 --> 03:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
but trying to be happy to take any
 
03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions if anybody wants a
 
03:04:11.110 --> 03:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
wants to ask them
 
03:04:12.710 --> 03:04:12.720 align:start position:0%

going back and forth with the municipal
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
county for another bill we tried to
 
03:06:11.269 --> 03:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 531 i wonder if it
 
03:06:13.429 --> 03:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
would be out of order to bring it up or
 
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
introduce it now
 
03:06:17.670 --> 03:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what you're talking about
 
03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative abramson um house bill
 
03:06:22.950 --> 03:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
531 was scheduled for 10 30 a.m relative
 
03:06:24.790 --> 03:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
to determining qualifications of voters
 
03:06:26.309 --> 03:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
and establishing provisional voter
 
03:06:30.389 --> 03:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:32.469 --> 03:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
and there was a reference for an
 
03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
amendment and i texted our
 
03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
pam smarling
 
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
our very able legislative assistant who
 
03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
knew nothing about an amendment so she
 
03:06:44.630 --> 03:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to send us it down
 
03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
to us
 
03:06:48.309 --> 03:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
i have officially closed the public
 
03:06:50.230 --> 03:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
hearing um
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative abramson and i don't know
 
03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
that i want to establish the precedent
 
03:07:00.630 --> 03:07:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:02.550 --> 03:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
so if you have an
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment if you could send that along
 
03:07:06.150 --> 03:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
03:07:06.160 --> 03:07:07.750 align:start position:0%
to the committee
with

03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:07:09.429 --> 03:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to consider it an
 
03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
03:07:15.910 --> 03:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay i did send an amendment to the
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
election law committee a couple of weeks
 
03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
ago so i'll i'll go find that and i'll
 
03:07:21.510 --> 03:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
resubmit that
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that the same amendment that we're
 
03:07:24.389 --> 03:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:07:26.150 --> 03:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
it it may very well be i'm not sure if
 
03:07:27.830 --> 03:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'm the sponsor on that one there may be
 
03:07:29.910 --> 03:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
another amendment that's come through
 
03:07:31.429 --> 03:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
we've been getting a number of
 
03:07:33.990 --> 03:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
amendments sent so if you could get that
 
03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
clarified and send it as a new
 
03:07:39.750 --> 03:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
um submission to us that would be
 
03:07:39.760 --> 03:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
um submission to us that would be
terrific

03:07:40.950 --> 03:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
terrific
 
03:07:42.870 --> 03:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay and if the chair would be willing
 
03:07:42.880 --> 03:07:43.590 align:start position:0%
okay and if the chair would be willing
to

03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:07:46.230 --> 03:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
um establish a subcommittee i could come
 
03:07:47.830 --> 03:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
in and speak for that if you want to get
 
03:07:50.790 --> 03:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
into the nuts and bolts of this
 
03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
but that's obviously up to the committee
 
03:07:55.429 --> 03:07:55.439 align:start position:0%
okay so far we haven't done any
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and we'll have to see how
 
03:07:58.630 --> 03:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
the committee feels about doing that as
 
03:08:01.190 --> 03:08:01.200 align:start position:0%

03:08:03.429 --> 03:08:03.439 align:start position:0%

04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
is relative to absentee voting and
 
04:01:40.469 --> 04:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
allowing for the partial
 
04:01:44.229 --> 04:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
processing of absentee ballots prior
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%

traveled to a distant state to transact
 
04:02:20.160 --> 04:02:21.349 align:start position:0%
traveled to a distant state to transact
business

04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
it served for my personal protection and
 
04:02:25.269 --> 04:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
for the protection of an
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
orderly society to verify my
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
identity to enter a bus to board an
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
airplane to purchase a property even to
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
withdraw my own money from my own bank
 
04:02:37.199 --> 04:02:38.469 align:start position:0%
withdraw my own money from my own bank
account

04:02:38.469 --> 04:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
account
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
some would argue that the high privilege
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
of voting an act that directs the
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
destiny of the state and country love
 
04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
should be done casually and with little
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
or no assurance that the person voting
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
is precisely who he or she says she is
 
04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes to expand absentee
 
04:02:58.309 --> 04:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
voting without establishing clear
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
verifiable and irrefutable evidence that
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
the person so directing the destiny of
 
04:03:06.389 --> 04:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
our towns cities state and nation are
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
precisely who they say they are
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair and fellow committee members
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
imagine if banks allowed absentee
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
withdrawal of your money from your
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
account at your bank without clear proof
 
04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
of identification just a flippant
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
concept of we trust people to do the
 
04:03:25.510 --> 04:03:25.520 align:start position:0%

to expand absentee voting without
 
04:03:33.910 --> 04:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
establishing a process for clear
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
absolute and verifiable identification
 
04:03:40.630 --> 04:03:40.640 align:start position:0%

changes are in conflict
 
04:07:24.710 --> 04:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
with the absentee voting eligibility
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
requirements of rsa 657 1.
 
04:07:30.309 --> 04:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
for example application change is
 
04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
proposed in section 1 of hb 144 and this
 
04:07:36.150 --> 04:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
is on page 1 line 30 page two lines two
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
to six
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
appear to conflict with the stipulation
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
of rsa 657
 
04:07:44.150 --> 04:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
colon one
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
section roman numeral two that
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility is due to national weather
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
service winter storm warnings etc for
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
election day apply only to absentee
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
voting on the monday before election day
 
04:07:57.349 --> 04:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
and that an applicant must satisfy other
 
04:08:00.389 --> 04:08:00.399 align:start position:0%
conditions listed in rsa 657
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
colon 1 roman numeral 2 parts a and b
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
therefore it is my opinion that the
 
04:08:08.070 --> 04:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee should find hb 144 inexpedient
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on hb
 
04:08:14.479 --> 04:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on hb
144

04:08:17.189 --> 04:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
144
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
from anybody here or online
 
04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
04:08:22.389 --> 04:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
yeah may i just have a point of order
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
for one second i think that um
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative cody is trying to get in
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
could somebody
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:37.670 --> 04:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:40.150 --> 04:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
i can resend him the link madam chairman
 
04:08:41.670 --> 04:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
i don't um
 
04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know i can i also try to find
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
tech support do you know what the nature
 
04:08:47.990 --> 04:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the problem is
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
yeah why don't you resend the link i
 
04:08:57.990 --> 04:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
think sometimes if you start from a new
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
email with a new link sometimes it works
 
04:09:00.479 --> 04:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
email with a new link sometimes it works
different

04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
all right i'll do that in
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:12.309 --> 04:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
all right we'll wait representative
 
04:09:14.309 --> 04:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
murray to your point i actually hadn't
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
looked at my screen i didn't realize he
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't on yet let's wait a couple of
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
minutes to see if he can get on
 
04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
so we're in
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%

we have time to work on this bill it's
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
related to some other bills that are
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
similar in nature that we will be taking
 
04:22:15.750 --> 04:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
up soon and
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%

appropriate

04:22:19.590 --> 04:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:22:23.429 --> 04:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%

04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor which is to retain
 
04:22:31.830 --> 04:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
hbo b 406. i'm yes ma'am check could i
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
just ask what's contemplated
 
04:22:35.670 --> 04:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:22:44.550 --> 04:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative prudhommer bryant i'm
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
sorry we're on 406. is this right i'm
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
getting yeah
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'm getting some different feedback
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
here uh
 
04:22:55.110 --> 04:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
04:22:57.030 --> 04:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
we're i think there's still some things
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
to discuss about this because there are
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
other bills that are related to the
 
04:23:03.269 --> 04:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
processing and counting of absentee
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
ballots that we
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
that may
 
04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that are related to this one and should
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
those pass this may not be relevant so
 
04:23:10.800 --> 04:23:12.469 align:start position:0%
those pass this may not be relevant so
we

04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure my recollection that i'll
 
04:23:17.750 --> 04:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
be voting for retaining is because
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
there's some question as to whether we
 
04:23:20.950 --> 04:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
need to further define the
 
04:23:23.110 --> 04:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
pre-processing procedure and i think
 
04:23:23.120 --> 04:23:24.149 align:start position:0%
pre-processing procedure and i think
that

04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:24.159 --> 04:23:26.870 align:start position:0%
that
um

04:23:26.870 --> 04:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
the public hearing testimony on this
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
indicated that the issue that drove the
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
bill was actually a pre-processing issue
 
04:23:33.520 --> 04:23:34.309 align:start position:0%
bill was actually a pre-processing issue
not

04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:23:37.510 --> 04:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
an election day issue so i think in
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
light of the need of amendments and
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
other bills the sponsor thought that
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
retaining it was
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
more appropriate and i apologize for
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
putting words in the sponsor's mouth but
 
04:23:49.349 --> 04:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just sort of more geared up on where
 
04:23:51.590 --> 04:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
we are then it's hard to keep up i know
 
04:23:55.110 --> 04:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
with 21 bills just today alone it's it
 
04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
is it is a challenge
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
so i hope representative cody that gives
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
you a little more insight
 
04:24:06.550 --> 04:24:06.560 align:start position:0%

uh while i uh appreciate the sponsor's
 
04:29:20.790 --> 04:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
intent of of the of the bill
 
04:29:22.950 --> 04:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
there were significant opposition from
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
the county attorneys and their their
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
representative uh to including them in
 
04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
the process for enforcing election laws
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i believe that we as a state should
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
be focused on one entity enforcing our
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
laws um and if this committee so chooses
 
04:29:39.110 --> 04:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
at a future date with future legislation
 
04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh focuses on that entity and not
 
04:29:44.469 --> 04:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
expanding the burden to other entities
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that aren't
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
currently prepared for this
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%

04:29:49.760 --> 04:29:50.550 align:start position:0%
so i do agree with the intention of the
bill

04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%

the way that he
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%

to speak to your motion yes thank you
 
04:34:38.629 --> 04:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
so we've heard all day today how
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
important our voting rights are
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
in this state and it's one of the most
 
04:34:46.390 --> 04:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
sacred rights that we have and most
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
important things that we do today
 
04:34:51.269 --> 04:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
so in light of that i believe that we
 
04:34:55.510 --> 04:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
pay attention to
 
04:34:58.470 --> 04:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
the ballot
 
04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
and we've heard some
 
04:35:02.709 --> 04:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
some discussion on this bill that
 
04:35:04.949 --> 04:35:04.959 align:start position:0%
sometimes people
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
make a mistake
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
well that's possible in life and
 
04:35:11.109 --> 04:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
certainly happens and and even people
 
04:35:13.269 --> 04:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
that are informed sometimes
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
make a mark in the wrong place at some
 
04:35:16.709 --> 04:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
point you have to draw the line as to
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
to to how
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
long you can go with with you know
 
04:35:23.189 --> 04:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
opening things back up and and giving
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
somebody a chance to take another look
 
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
at it i mean you could one could i you
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
could you could drag the process on
 
04:35:29.039 --> 04:35:30.070 align:start position:0%
could you could drag the process on
forever

04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
forever
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
so in light of that there are ways you
 
04:35:31.840 --> 04:35:32.629 align:start position:0%
so in light of that there are ways you
can

04:35:32.629 --> 04:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
to minimize
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
the error
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
most towns virtually every town i'm
 
04:35:38.789 --> 04:35:38.799 align:start position:0%
aware of in the state
 
04:35:38.799 --> 04:35:39.670 align:start position:0%
aware of in the state
um

04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
puts a sample ballot on to their website
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
and most towns allow you to go into the
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
town clerk and pick up a sample ballot
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
and if you examine the ballots in fact
 
04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
in our time we have an election tomorrow
 
04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
town election you can take a look at the
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
ballot you can see who's on the ballot
 
04:35:57.269 --> 04:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
you can research who's on it warn
 
04:36:01.750 --> 04:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
take a look if it's a race that has more
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
than one person running and you can vote
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
more than one you can see those numbers
 
04:36:11.349 --> 04:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
so in light of all of that i believe um
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't change this because again
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
if we do it also potentially creates a
 
04:36:18.070 --> 04:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
couple different classes because under
 
04:36:20.230 --> 04:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
the analysis of this bill it requires
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
ballots that include a federal office
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily ones that don't so
 
04:36:25.750 --> 04:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
on one hand you're going to allow
 
04:36:28.230 --> 04:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
another hand you're not and then if
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
somebody chooses to
 
04:36:29.760 --> 04:36:31.029 align:start position:0%
somebody chooses to
to

04:36:31.029 --> 04:36:31.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
change it they may one could argue that
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
maybe over franchise where somebody else
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
that doesn't or doesn't have a chance to
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
would be under franchise so in light of
 
04:36:41.189 --> 04:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
all of these reasons i i ask you to join
 
04:36:42.949 --> 04:36:42.959 align:start position:0%
me in finding this legislation in
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
exceeding the legislate thank you does
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to speak to the motion
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
on the floor representative prudhomme
 
04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
o'brien thank you i i heard somebody
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
make a comment first of all this is not
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
exactly related but that they could not
 
04:36:57.990 --> 04:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
hear me when i was voting and i was uh
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
not using my microphone i think
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
people know i voted in the with the
 
04:37:03.670 --> 04:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
majority of all the bills that we've
 
04:37:05.830 --> 04:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
heard so far so i just want to let that
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
be said
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh this bill
 
04:37:11.910 --> 04:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think has some positive intentions
 
04:37:11.920 --> 04:37:12.789 align:start position:0%
i think has some positive intentions
and

04:37:12.789 --> 04:37:12.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
that's what the sponsor was going for
 
04:37:19.830 --> 04:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't think
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate
 
04:37:25.830 --> 04:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
for the towns that have hand counts they
 
04:37:27.750 --> 04:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
don't put the ballots into the ballot
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
counting machine
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
and that means that in order to find out
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
if someone is doing an overvote you have
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
to look at their ballot when they're in
 
04:37:36.150 --> 04:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
front of you
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
giving you their ballot so these are
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
some major privacy issues for those
 
04:37:43.189 --> 04:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
people and that's why this bill should
 
04:37:45.429 --> 04:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
not that should be an expedient to
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
legislate it should not pass
 
04:37:51.390 --> 04:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on hb
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
491 which is in front of the committee
 
04:37:55.590 --> 04:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
with the motion of inexpedient to
 
04:37:55.600 --> 04:37:57.750 align:start position:0%
with the motion of inexpedient to
legislate

04:37:57.750 --> 04:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anything
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
we're hearing so i'm going to ask the
 
04:38:04.390 --> 04:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
clerk to come madame clark
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
there are several there were several of
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
us raising our hands i think oh okay i'm
 
04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm
 
04:38:14.230 --> 04:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think maybe even with these glasses i
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
need to be closer to the screen
 
04:38:18.709 --> 04:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh i want to speak in opposition to the
 
04:38:23.349 --> 04:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
motion please okay go ahead
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
um this bill uh does not
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
is aimed at getting
 
04:38:30.070 --> 04:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
correcting machine mistakes not
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily voter mistakes as
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative porter testified many of
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
these that are rejected by the machine
 
04:38:39.670 --> 04:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
are because of errors or marks on the
 
04:38:41.670 --> 04:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
ballots themselves it's not due to
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
mistakes and given the importance of
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
being of a of an election and our right
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
to vote i think it's important that we
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
give somebody an extra few minutes if
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
they need it to either figure out if
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
it's the machine or if they didn't color
 
04:38:58.949 --> 04:38:58.959 align:start position:0%
in the block the right color and it does
 
04:39:02.551 --> 04:39:02.561 align:start position:0%
not affect the hand votes towns
 
04:39:05.349 --> 04:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
it only applies to the machine
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
vote towns does not i do not think it
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
creates a class a special class
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
i will be voting against
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lane does
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else have their hand up i'm not
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
seeing an electronic hand but if there
 
04:39:24.869 --> 04:39:24.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't i don't think i'm
 
04:39:29.429 --> 04:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
seeing anything else i i will just say
 
04:39:31.750 --> 04:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
that my recollection was the concern was
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
not that this was machine count but that
 
04:39:36.789 --> 04:39:36.799 align:start position:0%
people voting in hand count towns would
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
not have the same opportunity to have
 
04:39:41.190 --> 04:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
their ballot corrected because those
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
ballots go directly into a box that are
 
04:39:47.350 --> 04:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
not removed to the end of the night
 
04:39:49.270 --> 04:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
um so there were a couple of different
 
04:39:52.868 --> 04:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
distinctions as to what was going on
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so i'm going to ask
 
04:40:00.628 --> 04:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call a roll which is hb

from excused voting that is absentee
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
voting historically absentee voting is
 
04:42:23.590 --> 04:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
allowed when there is an excuse for one
 
04:42:25.110 --> 04:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
reason or another to not appear in
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
person on election day
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
to adopt this bill would be to truly
 
04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
substantially change our elections in
 
04:42:34.708 --> 04:42:34.718 align:start position:0%
our election day and there really was no
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
sustaining evidence that needs to be
 
04:42:36.718 --> 04:42:37.590 align:start position:0%
sustaining evidence that needs to be
done

04:42:37.590 --> 04:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%

colleagues to support a motion of itl
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%

04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
situation we we were operating under
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
as covid was allowed as an excuse for
 
04:43:12.868 --> 04:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
not voting
 
04:43:12.878 --> 04:43:14.150 align:start position:0%
not voting
uh

04:43:14.150 --> 04:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
operationally we had that situation and
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
i thought things went rather well and
 
04:43:20.948 --> 04:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
i've always thought it was rather
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
ridiculous because we we have an
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
expansive list of exceptions
 
04:43:30.788 --> 04:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
to that particular statute and i think
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
that we ought to be honest and just say
 
04:43:35.350 --> 04:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you want to vote absentee
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
you ought to be able to thank you

um is there a motion on this
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%

04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:45:47.590 --> 04:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
hb 524 fn proposes to establish a
 
04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
defined and routine
 
04:45:52.230 --> 04:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
audit process to verify the accuracy and
 
04:45:54.390 --> 04:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
integrity of the election process in new
 
04:45:54.400 --> 04:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
integrity of the election process in new
hampshire

04:45:55.510 --> 04:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
this legislature routinely affirms the
 
04:46:00.230 --> 04:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
importance of routine
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
audits to assure the integrity and
 
04:46:04.788 --> 04:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
reliability of our banking and security
 
04:46:04.798 --> 04:46:06.788 align:start position:0%
reliability of our banking and security
industries

04:46:06.788 --> 04:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
industries
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
those audits only deal with our money
 
04:46:11.510 --> 04:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
here we are dealing with something even
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
more important than our money the
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
integrity of our vote i do believe this
 
04:46:17.670 --> 04:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
very important matter needs to be
 
04:46:19.590 --> 04:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
addressed but i believe this bill needs
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
some additional work to clarify and
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
expand its scope so i ask you to vote to
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
retain h.b 524.
 
04:46:30.948 --> 04:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative growings as
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
um i representative bergeron would you
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman if i may
 
04:46:39.920 --> 04:46:40.948 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman if i may
um

04:46:40.948 --> 04:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:42.708 --> 04:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
i'm going to
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
vote against the motion to retain
 
04:46:50.070 --> 04:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
and my reason for doing so is that
 
04:46:51.670 --> 04:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
this is not an
 
04:46:53.910 --> 04:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
burdensome or unreasonable bill that
 
04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
would establish an audit process
 
04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bill can easily be implemented uh i
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
also think it's it's time that we
 
04:47:03.190 --> 04:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
stopped kicking the audit can down the
 
04:47:03.200 --> 04:47:04.390 align:start position:0%
stopped kicking the audit can down the
road

04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:47:06.868 --> 04:47:06.878 align:start position:0%
last session we had several bills before
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
um asking that some kind of
 
04:47:12.868 --> 04:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
post-election audit be established
 
04:47:15.750 --> 04:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
and one of those bills senate bill 283
 
04:47:19.190 --> 04:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
which was sponsored by senator gray
 
04:47:20.788 --> 04:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
required that the secretary of state
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
submit a report by november 1st on
 
04:47:25.590 --> 04:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
conducting audits of electronic ballot
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
accounting devices
 
04:47:28.948 --> 04:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
conducting uh
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
post-election audits
 
04:47:32.400 --> 04:47:33.750 align:start position:0%
post-election audits
and

04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:35.670 --> 04:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
that report was supposed to be submitted
 
04:47:37.910 --> 04:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
by november 1st
 
04:47:37.920 --> 04:47:39.190 align:start position:0%
by november 1st
the

04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:41.948 --> 04:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
draft has not been submitted
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i think i had written
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
several reports citing the need and the
 
04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
expectation that this report would be
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
coming out as a reason
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
not to
 
04:47:53.910 --> 04:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
approve the other bills asking for
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
post-election audits
 
04:47:57.430 --> 04:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
i think particularly given what's been
 
04:47:59.350 --> 04:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
going on in windham
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's time to move forward i know that
 
04:48:03.670 --> 04:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
senator gray has another bill coming
 
04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
forward that now wants to establish a
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee to study election audit
 
04:48:10.070 --> 04:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
counting devices and
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
let's just stop postponing this this is
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
a reasonable bill it's easy to implement
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:21.670 --> 04:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
does anybody else want to speak to this
 
04:48:21.680 --> 04:48:22.708 align:start position:0%
does anybody else want to speak to this
motion

04:48:22.708 --> 04:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
representative terezian
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:48:29.430 --> 04:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
um i i think most of us agree that we do
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
want to see this passed and that's why
 
04:48:33.990 --> 04:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're retaining it so we can make sure
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
we iron out the details so when we pass
 
04:48:38.550 --> 04:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
it it uh
 
04:48:40.470 --> 04:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
we've got it correct
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for the retained
 
04:48:41.920 --> 04:48:44.470 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for the retained
motion

04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
the chair is going to take the
 
04:48:47.910 --> 04:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say she
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
she would like to see something pass but
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
in doing that i am concerned that the
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
focus is solely on an audit to date we
 
04:48:56.948 --> 04:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
do not have not had a specific audit
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
process because we have more recounts
 
04:49:02.550 --> 04:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
than any other jurisdiction getting a
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
recount in new hampshire is incredibly
 
04:49:05.280 --> 04:49:06.390 align:start position:0%
recount in new hampshire is incredibly
easy

04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
easy
 
04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
and true a recount deals with a
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
particular race as compared to
 
04:49:13.270 --> 04:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:49:15.190 --> 04:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
functioning of the machine across the
 
04:49:15.200 --> 04:49:16.550 align:start position:0%
functioning of the machine across the
ballot

04:49:16.550 --> 04:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
but i think there needs to be an
 
04:49:20.708 --> 04:49:20.718 align:start position:0%
overview approach to this i am aware
 
04:49:22.310 --> 04:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
that there are bills coming from the
 
04:49:25.030 --> 04:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
senate to do something similar
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
but i am also concerned when i have
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
someone come in and say that they've
 
04:49:30.480 --> 04:49:31.510 align:start position:0%
someone come in and say that they've
picked

04:49:31.510 --> 04:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
picked
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh three polling places of a particular
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
place and two polling places randomly
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i guess i would like to know
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
statistically from an audit standpoint
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
if there are 240 polling places is that
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
amount of audits statistically
 
04:49:45.120 --> 04:49:46.390 align:start position:0%
amount of audits statistically
significant

04:49:46.390 --> 04:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
and i suggest to you that neither the
 
04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor or anybody in this room could
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
answer that question so there's no point
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
in doing the audit but from that
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
standpoint in my mind because if all
 
04:49:58.868 --> 04:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
we're doing is
 
04:50:01.030 --> 04:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
a check of tabulation we're effectively
 
04:50:03.190 --> 04:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
doing that with recounts
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
but i think the concept is incredibly
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
important and i would like to make sure
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
that we are not as stopped as a body
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
this year from addressing it next year
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
um so i'm going to support the motion to
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
retain but
 
04:50:20.788 --> 04:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
i don't like kicking things down the
 
04:50:20.798 --> 04:50:21.910 align:start position:0%
i don't like kicking things down the
road

04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
road
 
04:50:23.590 --> 04:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
retaining i think other committees are
 
04:50:25.510 --> 04:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
retaining a lot more bills than we are
 
04:50:27.270 --> 04:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
because they're sort of doing that and i
 
04:50:28.628 --> 04:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
and i don't really want to but that's
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
sort of where i am on this one anybody
 
04:50:30.320 --> 04:50:31.270 align:start position:0%
sort of where i am on this one anybody
else

04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
i would agree with attorney i'm sorry
 
04:50:39.030 --> 04:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:50:42.788 --> 04:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
mostly because as he referenced we voted
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
on this i think twice i've only this one
 
04:50:47.190 --> 04:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
my second term but i think i've seen
 
04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
this bill two or three times
 
04:50:49.360 --> 04:50:50.310 align:start position:0%
this bill two or three times
and

04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:52.948 --> 04:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state could easily imp
 
04:50:56.150 --> 04:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know put in uh regulations could get
 
04:50:57.670 --> 04:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
some people to do that i don't think we
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
have to lay out
 
04:51:02.150 --> 04:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
all the details in the statute
 
04:51:02.160 --> 04:51:03.670 align:start position:0%
all the details in the statute
but

04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%

11 to 9.

hb 524 will be retained not the end of
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
04:53:03.910 --> 04:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
concludes what i announced at the
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
beginning we'd be addressing today
 
04:53:09.750 --> 04:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
there had been some hope that we were
 
04:53:12.070 --> 04:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
going to get through all of our business
 
04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
today but i think given
 
04:53:16.470 --> 04:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
the issues we're ending this session
 
04:53:16.480 --> 04:53:17.510 align:start position:0%
the issues we're ending this session
with

04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
that turned out to be a little
 
04:53:19.120 --> 04:53:20.708 align:start position:0%
that turned out to be a little
unrealistic

04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
unrealistic
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
so um we will be meeting on wednesday at
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock
 
04:53:27.910 --> 04:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
at 10 not 9 30
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
and for those of you present or coming
 
04:53:31.830 --> 04:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
to lob
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
it will be back in our lowly 306
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
308 room i think on the third floor for
 
04:53:41.270 --> 04:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
those of you observing online we are in
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
the finance committee room today and
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
this is like being elevated to really
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
important people when you sit in this
 
04:53:50.868 --> 04:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
room at the table so
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
we will be back in the other section of
 
04:53:56.310 --> 04:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
lob so to review the bills that we will
