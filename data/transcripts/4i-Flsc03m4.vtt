00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
very quick overview um as um the Deputy
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioner noted uh representative
 
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
Edwards has been very interested in our
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
school-based health project which has
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
been um in Manchester School District in
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
partnership with Amis Health Services uh
 
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
just to refresh your mind there's a and
 
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
there's a slide deck in front of you if
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
you want to get ahead and you know read
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
ahead um to refresh your mind back in
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
2021 as part of a number of funding
 
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities that came from the Centers
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
for Disease Control and prevention one
 
00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
of them was around resources to help um
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
support the public health Workforce and
 
00:06:33.309 --> 00:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
not only the public health Workforce
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Health and
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
Human Services but throughout the entire
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
State and one of the key areas that they
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
were interested in was school health um
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
Most states have lots of school health
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
clinics New Hampshire actually doesn't
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
we do not have a long history of that
 
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
and um but we use this as an opportunity
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
to support some efforts that we growing
 
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
um currently we do have um there are
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
probably two other areas in the state
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
that do school health in some way
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester is the area in which they
 
00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
they have engaged in a much more robust
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
way to provide services and this
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
coincides with the youth Mental Health
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
crisis that we have been talking about
 
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
over and over at this commit at this
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
committee and so am SK took this
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity we put out an RFP um they
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
applied they were the only folks that
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
applied for the funds so we gave them
 
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars to get to work
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
to build some infrastructure within the
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
Manchester school districts to provide
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
both behavoral health services and
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
physical health services if you scoot
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
ahead in the slides a little bit on um
 
00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
on slide uh I believe I they're not
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
numbered so where it says what was
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
accomplished we've been able to provide
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
almost 7,000 Behavioral Health visits
 
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
through this funding and that's through
 
00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
um Amis being able to put behavioral
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
health professionals in person in
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
schools to provide those that Health
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
Care one of the things that repres
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative um Edwards has always
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
been concerned about this is parent
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
participation and parent um uh
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
permission to go through this process
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know this is just a reminder that we
 
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.120 align:start position:0%
built that into both our RFP process it
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
was an expectation going in that there
 
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
would be a robust expectations that
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
parents would be involved and have um be
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
able to determine what kind of what if
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
any kind of Health Services they
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
received um amamos took that in their
 
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680 align:start position:0%
very um qualified very credible Health
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
Center they understand the importance of
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
parent participation and parent um uh
 
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
permission slips as it were and so they
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
worked with the school board and so the
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
school board approved the process the
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
health u center approved the process and
 
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
Services all approved that we've
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
received nothing but glowing feedback
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
from families that this is really
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
important to them it provides an
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to get the services
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
they need while while they're kids in
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
school they don't have to go in pull
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
their kids out of school we all know
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
that learning time especially out of the
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic is so important and so again as
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
as a as a high reel almost 7,000
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health visits about um
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
1,167 unique students were enrolled in
 
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
the services again not the entire School
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
District but really families that wanted
 
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to take part of that and
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
about 208 physical health services acute
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
care visit were also provided in this
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
time the money is going to run out we
 
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
knew this all along this was going to be
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
one-time money it was going to be in and
 
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
it was going to come out it um ends at
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
the end of this fiscal year but the good
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
news is is that with this investment we
 
00:09:47.949 --> 00:09:47.959 align:start position:0%
were able to set up the services um
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
amamos was able to work out the Kinks in
 
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
terms of Medicaid billing and commercial
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
insurance billing and so this will be
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
sustainable long after our initial
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
investment in getting
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
you know the paperwork and getting the
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
actual space set up in the school those
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
investments will live longer um live
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
much longer than the actual investment
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we're going to make through public
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
health so I'm happy to take questions um
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
Tilly representative
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
King thank you Mr chairman uh it's just
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
a really quick question uh you mentioned
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
sustainability after the money runs out
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
um are you going to require more funding
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
how does how does that work the
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
sustaining part sure so the project was
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
built with the acknowledgement that
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
these funds their federal funds from CDC
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
were going to go away you know it was Co
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
money from Heaven it came out it was
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
going to be here and then it was going
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
to go and so our charge to amamos was
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do this um through
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
your own billing from both public
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
insurance and Commercial Insurance so
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
that you can can sustain this moving
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
forward and it's also within the um work
 
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
of a federally qualified Health Center
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
to provide other resource you know wrap
 
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
around resources as well the school has
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
also committed to make the space
 
00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
available um at because they get the
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
benefit from it so it's a true
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
partnership in the
 
00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
community representative
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
Weber so have I understood correctly
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
that what what you will have done after
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
this year is essentially
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
stood up a clinic a satellite Clinic
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
that happens to be operating in the
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
schools but is
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
funded in exactly the same way as amamos
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
gig's other operations that is correct
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
yes that's a much better way to to
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair also thank
 
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
you for this wonderful report is there
 
00:11:57.629 --> 00:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
something as scalable throughout the
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
state in other words taking what what we
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
learned in Manchester instead of
 
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
Reinventing the wheel taking that wheel
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
and applying it to other school
 
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:06.200 align:start position:0%
districts because I think according to
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
what we heard from represented Weber the
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
way you sort of framed it it's more of a
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
clinic based inside of a school system
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
and is that something we can duplicate
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
throughout the state know there are
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
other areas of the state that are
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
interested in it I know in straford
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
county in particular they've been toying
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
with this idea for a while through the
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
greater SE Coast um federally qualified
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
Health Center um they were not ready at
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
the time these funds were available to
 
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
jump on board interestingly Newport
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
School District up in Sullivan County
 
00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
has been doing a version of this for
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
many years for well over a decade maybe
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
even almost close to two decades it sort
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
of grows and expands based on the
 
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
workforce that's available in that
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
Community but that's a partnership with
 
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
the Newport Health Center as part of New
 
00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
London Hospital um so yes it's immensely
 
00:12:54.629 --> 00:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
scalable we don't have particular
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
resources we use these Federal resources
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
right now to really stand it up and
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
again we were very pleased to be able to
 
00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959 align:start position:0%
do it in Manchester because the need is
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
so great and the scale is so great there
 
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
you know there certainly would be
 
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
challenges in smaller districts but I I
 
00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
think this is a model that could could
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
state is that uh aspirational or are
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
there plans to try to make it go wider
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's aspirational at this point because
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
we don't have the resources to sort of
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
say here get going you know we had these
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
resources they had beginning and an end
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
date um we were thrilled that Manchester
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
was able to make it work but we are
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
always happy to partner with our other
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
health centers or other federally
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
qualified Health Centers we support them
 
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
in other ways through the division of
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services um and certainly
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
Amis is is very willing to share their
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
learning on how they make this work and
 
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
should funds become available from
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
whatever sources you got the model yes
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
and we would be happy to promote this
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
again if funds were were to be made
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
available if you know General funds were
 
00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
to be made available we could do
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
that anyone else I have a question yes
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
Senator commissioner yes Senator
 
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
um and I I'm GNA wax poetic here a
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
little bit uh Dr Sherman and I former
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
Senator uh had a conversation in Health
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
and Human Services several years ago
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
about a particular program and he was
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
putting all these restrictions and I
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
says well that's something that the
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
oversight committee should know all
 
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
right but I have no way personally of
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
going in and saying okay all of the
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that are put upon you by
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
Statute are being taken care of okay um
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
I've been on this committee for two
 
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
three years whatever it is now and I
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
don't see that this committee has a way
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
of doing that either and and so um back
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
in my former days it would have been an
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
an internal audit to make sure that I
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
was doing the things I was supposed to
 
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
and I would like to either see that or
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
see a report of that uh done in health
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
and human services so that I know that
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
you and I are on the same page as to
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
requirements and actions yeah no thank
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
you so much for the the question um so
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's something that I think we want
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
to think about really thoughtfully but
 
00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:34.839 align:start position:0%
what I and and there are other groups
 
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:36.519 align:start position:0%
who have come to us in a similar vein of
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
saying like joint fiscal committee has
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
said you know can you provide us some of
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
the basic statistics on your operating
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
activities or in this case you're asking
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
more around our areas of statutory
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
Authority so we definitely are in the
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
process of working on some more public
 
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
facing dashboards to provide that Bird's
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
eyee view um another thing that we
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
embarked on this year that um I believe
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
we presented here uh about nine months
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
ago is we worked on our first ever road
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
map as a department meant to outline our
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
um priorities as we fulfill um our
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
obligations the department and our um
 
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
statutory uh requirements as well as
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
some of the Strategic priorities around
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services happening um
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
based on need here in the state and and
 
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
being seen nationally in some cases so
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
um we are looking to grow some of that
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
and make more transparent some of our
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
strategic planning as a department which
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
has never really been done before and I
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
think this could be an excellent body to
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
share that with I think given your
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
interest what I'm hearing in your
 
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
question is a desire not just for you to
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
be coming to us with topics but for us
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
to be reporting to you some of what's
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
going on some of what's succeeding some
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
of what what what is struggling does
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
that begin to answer some of what you're
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
asking about the way I would have termed
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
it you know in my past life is a
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
compliance audit okay is that here's the
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
list of the statutes you know in here
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
there is a go do or th th sh thou shal
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
so i' certainly you know I want to bring
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
it up today I'm certainly willing to
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
work with your your Prime legal counsel
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
there in the back uh I would like it put
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
on as an agenda item for continuing
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
meetings uh so that we can talk about it
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
but I know and I'm going to go to
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
fishing game okay fishing game had a
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
requirement to do
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay they ignored it they ignored it
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
they ignored it they ignored it okay how
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
do I make sure that that's not happening
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
in other departments well one way in
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
this one is I am on the oversight
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I want to know how you
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
guys are ensuring
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
compliance so we'll leave it at that for
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
right now they'll give us a whole month
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
to talk about it and figure out what we
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
want to do it's going to be an agenda
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
item I've got the chairs you know head
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
shaken up and down
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
and Mr Williams Esquire is more than
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
happy I'm sure to come see me and talk
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
about what we can and cannot do yeah no
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the idea we will um look
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
forward to brainstorming with uh with Mr
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
Williams also with our um director uh of
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
the division for program quality and
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
integrity I mean as you know we do a
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount to demonstrate that we
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
are we are fulfilling our obligations to
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
a number of different bodies including
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
our federal authorities who um fund a
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
significant amount of this through
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and other channels so I
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate your interest in wanting to
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
in in in fact in giving us an
 
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share the ways in which
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
we're meeting those obligations and to
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
invite questions about areas of our work
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
since it is very broad um that may not
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
naturally come up on the agenda
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise so let's all put our heads
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
together and see what we can come up
 
00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
with representative Weber
 
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
point out that in this life we do have
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
um as an ongoing operation uh the
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask for performance
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
Audits and obviously a performance audit
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
of the entire department is well outside
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
the scope of anything any of us can
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
possibly manage but if there are I
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
believe the senator made a reference to
 
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
a specific program so if there was a
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
specific programmer parameters that you
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
were concerned about that's exactly what
 
00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a performance audit is is
 
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
to take the statutory directives and
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are being followed and
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
if not why not and there's an in-depth
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
exploration of um what might what needs
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
to change what might change what might
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
be an unreasonable expectation but it's
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
a really good start for a very thorough
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
conversation and I
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
highly recommend it and I sit on that
 
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee so let me
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
know representative Merchant thank you
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair following up on the Senator's
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
comments about the issue of
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
compliance being inste of uh new
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
individual in this committee what would
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
be helpful to me is understanding what
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
are the things we're looking to be
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
compliant to because I don't really
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
understand what statutory requirements
 
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
are out there that the department has to
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
basically comply too so before we get
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
into the compliance audit be helpful for
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
myself anyways to understand what are
 
00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
the things we should be thinking about
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
looking at and going back to our
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
meetings and saying are we talking about
 
00:20:41.549 --> 00:20:41.559 align:start position:0%
the statutory requirements that the
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
department has to fulfill to be
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
compliant with
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
whatever Mr chair just representative
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
Weber I can't know what particular
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
compliances Senator gray has in mind but
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
um basically the compliance that is
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
looked at in a performance audit is the
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements of Any Given
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
program so they're going to be very
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
different for every single program
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
they're not you know uh it's it's not
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
one thing but um they can be looked at
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
there there can also be discussions
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
directly but I I just wanted to make it
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
clear that they
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
are the compliance that they look at as
 
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to whatever it is that Senator
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
gray is looking for is taken directly
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
from the statute that applies to
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
whatever program you're looking at do
 
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
you just read the statute followup thank
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for them represent
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
Weber I'm not looking per se
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
for how they being compant to whatever
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
it is we're talking about compliance too
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
but what are the list of the programs
 
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
that require some sort of compliance
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
because it's a large where do I find
 
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.630 align:start position:0%
because it's a large where do I find
that

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
list I'm pretty sure when I became
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner there are these big
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
books on my shelf that were handed to me
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
in their Health and Human Services
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
statute for so and they're they're great
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
paper weights and they're undoubtedly
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
contain also really important
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
information I think that our challenge
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
throughout this is going to be how to
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
make it useful and how to make it I mean
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
without again with a spirit and a
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
commitment toward full
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
transparency um our responsibilities and
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
our our portfolio if you will is so is
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
is really quite vast especially when
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
compared to other departments in the
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
state and so I think what I appreciate
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
about the challenge you're giving us
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
collectively here is how do we how do we
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
provide an overview of what the
 
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
department does so that you can zero in
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
on those areas of interest and so that
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
we can complete Our obligation to you of
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
of providing information justification
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
identifying our strengths and our
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
weaknesses um and so I think I think
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a CH all but I think there
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
have to be ways that we can make we can
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
take those books and turn it into both a
 
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
um a road map for what I'm sorry reusing
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
the ro road map but essentially we
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
should be able to describe what we do to
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
you uh and just as we do every budget
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
season to the various budget committees
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
we should be able to um provide
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
opportunities to be ask questions but we
 
00:23:18.669 --> 00:23:18.679 align:start position:0%
also don't want it this to turn into a
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
10-hour meeting of going through giant
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
volumes of hard cover um texts I think
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
useful

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
useful
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
good we'll keep the dialogue going on
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you so much thank you and
 
00:23:36.909 --> 00:23:36.919 align:start position:0%
speaking of councilor Williams will you
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
introduce your special new friends here
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
point now the hardest part about
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
testifying before committee
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
is what that turn the on clearly and tur

00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
less nervous than I was last year um and
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
I remember bringing a copy of the thank
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
you note that Michaela who will
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
introduce herself in a moment sent to me
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the tuition waiver program
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
this year I was able to get her to
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
appear before you in person so my name
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
is Beth me I am an employee of

Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
as a youth engagement
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
specialist and part of my position is
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
oversight of the tuition waiver
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
program it's um the benefit of the
 
00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
program is
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
invaluable um it has assisted youth all
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
over the state to attend our Comm
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
community colleges and the University of
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.310 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
system

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
colleges um a significant positive
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
change to the tuition waiver program
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
occurred July 1st with the passage of a
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
house bill where our youth-driven work
 
00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
we came to the State House on a number
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
of occasions this past fall or a year
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
ago um these changes included increasing
 
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.039 align:start position:0%
the number of waiver per system from 15
 
00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:31.149 align:start position:0%
the number of waiver per system from 15
to

00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
35 it also moved the age limitation for
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
application from 23 to 26 because not
 
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.510 align:start position:0%
application from 23 to 26 because not
all

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
youth have a prescribed way of attending
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
school um it also incl was more
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
inclusive for um dcyf care for
 
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
guardianship or who were placed with a
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
relative out of state to be eligible for
 
00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.870 align:start position:0%
relative out of state to be eligible for
the

00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
year we had an unprecedented 65
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
certified applicants apply for the
 
00:26:10.399 --> 00:26:11.430 align:start position:0%
certified applicants apply for the
tuition

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
waiver for various reasons 52 of them
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
followed through and are in in the
 
00:26:22.149 --> 00:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
university and Community College system
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
now um and that was well over the 49
 
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
applicants from last year and the 48
 
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.269 align:start position:0%
applicants from last year and the 48
from

00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
2022 so it really has shown a big
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
expansion which is
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
exciting um 24 waiver slots were awarded
 
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
from the University system of New
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 10 of them to returning
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
students and uh 28 to the community
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
college system 10 of them also returning
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
students so we're starting to see youth
 
00:27:00.669 --> 00:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
graduate and become certified in the
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
areas of study that they're interested
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'll introduce
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
Michaela hi um my name is michaa Willie
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
um I am a sophomore in college and this
 
00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
is my second year um receiving the
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver so my mom adopted me and
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
she is a single mother on a teacher
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
salary so she offered to help me pay for
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
college but I didn't want to put that
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
burden on her so I went to nhti and the
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
tuition waiver really helped I wanted to
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
do dental hygiene which is expensive to
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
buy all of your equipment so that would
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
have been relief um but I actually
 
00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:47.720 align:start position:0%
decided that I wanted to change to
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
occupational therapy um and I really
 
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
would not have considered that if it
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't for the tuition waiver because
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
they don't have that at nhci so I had to
 
00:27:59.669 --> 00:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
switch to un which is a big Financial
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
jump from nhg so I was thankful to
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
receive it again and it has allowed me
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
to apply and get into the Occupational
 
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
Therapy Program and I am really excited
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
to pursue that and it wouldn't have been
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
waiver represent representative
 
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
Weber I just wanted to say as as a
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:28.039 align:start position:0%

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for all you do for the
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire we're in it
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:59.230 align:start position:0%
 
money

00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
I've asked uh Mr Henry Lipman our
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director to come to this
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
meeting and give us an update on
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
whatever he wants to but especially the
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid dental and I see that um Delta
 
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
dentl gave somebody a half a million
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
dollars it it wasn't me so I'm just
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
wondering um if you know what it goes to
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
does some of it or all of it go to the
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
dental uh program that we're doing or
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
what welcome
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for the record Henry lman
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
the state's Medicaid director the I
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
think the donation you're talking about
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
went to the federally qualified Health
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
Center in Manchester um as a general
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
donation but that program does have
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
dental with it and so indirectly will'll
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
be supporting it um all the more since
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
she's no longer going to be a dental
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
hygienist yes that's right um and I
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
think they've also um I don't think it's
 
00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
maybe made it to public uh as widely
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
publicly known but I think they also
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
helped the eMusic Health Center recently
 
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
as well um and um you know I think that
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
they're making a good effort to to uh
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
help build out the network it's we still
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
have work to do um I know there was an
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
article recently in the New Hampshire
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
bulletin about uh you know for the
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled in terms of
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
expanding the number of dentists who um
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
but I think the good news there is The
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
Advocates um are working with us and
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
trying to help us um and trying to um
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
reach and get additional dentist to
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
participate um we I think have seen um
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
uh the month of uh our latest statistics
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
um an increasing number of individuals
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
who think over 3,000 last month that had
 
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
Dental claims um and so it continues to
 
00:30:57.789 --> 00:30:57.799 align:start position:0%
build not
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
we still have more to to to do there but
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
I think if you look at what had to be
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
done in terms of the time to stand up
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
the program get all the waivers in place
 
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
um and and you know basically build out
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
a network we're really pretty young in
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
the life of of the dental program um and
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that also rates have been in
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
the news a little bit I do want to make
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
sure people are aware that the adult
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
Dental rates
 
00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
um when the legislature approved the
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation allowed us to almost
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
double what they were historically and
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
um Delta Dental has also added to it in
 
00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
certain select procedures where they
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
feel like they need to help build the
 
00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
network out um further at you know at
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
their expense if you will um and I I'll
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
working on getting you some statistics
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
on that in terms of how our Medicaid
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
Program compares to others as a
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of commercial so I think I
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
have a a report uh that will suggest
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
that we're sort of on the upper end in
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
terms of Medicaid programs now with with
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
that change we also I know Children's
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
dental program is not part of um the
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
Delta program at this point but also
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
through um hb2 we're able to bring the
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
Children's Dental rates so that they're
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
equal which um was starting to become a
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
problem since they weren't so that's
 
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
been implemented um we're still using a
 
00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:33.519 align:start position:0%
mobile Dental um van to help build out
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
the the network so I'll stop there and
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
see if there are any
 
00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
dle have you in your opinion pretty much
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
got to the number of participating
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
dentists you think you're going to get
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
to or are you getting one or two a
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
little bit at a time now a little bit at
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
a time now what I hope to be able to
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
demonstrate through the the program that
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
you know if you kind of think about
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
technology they're early adopters and
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
then people come along the line I think
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
we have the early adopters pretty well
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
captured and I think we need to work our
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
way up towards um people who may wait a
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
while to make sure that the program's
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
working as intended and also Delta
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
Dental had also provided sign on bonuses
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
for quite a long time in terms of just
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
for signing up they paid $1,000 for for
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
someone to join and I also want to say
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
if if you hear of people that um are in
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
a dental distress situation Dr Finny um
 
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
and the dental director at Delta Dental
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
can help get access if there's a certain
 
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
circumstance where you know someone's
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
having a real Dental problem um you know
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
I know even in the private dental world
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get even you know basic
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
teeth cleaning um you know as fast as
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
you'd like sometimes so um we working at
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
it and you know I heard earlier about
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
the the funding that uh helped that
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
individual my understanding there's some
 
00:34:08.829 --> 00:34:08.839 align:start position:0%
more money coming into play for for
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
recruitment remind me about dental Vans
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
going to remote
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
places so um we have a company that
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
through Delta Dental and denta quest
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
which is their subcontractor um where
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
they come in with a complete um
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
operatory if you will um with with a
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
dentist and they've been going to a
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
communities um where there have been um
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know shortage of dentists relatively
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
they've gone to you know up to Berlin
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
they've gone up to Laconia they've gone
 
00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
um they're planning to be on the up in
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
the Claremont area they've been that
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
one's taking a little while to find a
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
place where they can site it because
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty big big vehicle
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
um but we're probably getting two or
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
three days a month and then we come back
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
after so many weeks if there's followup
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
care so that can be done as well how
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
relatively easy or difficult is it for a
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
dentist and or a hygienist to work off
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
of other tools like tools that are in a
 
00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
van as opposed to their office so they
 
00:35:20.829 --> 00:35:20.839 align:start position:0%
actually bring the whole team and so
 
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
that's it's a it's a complete dental
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
practice if you will that's that's
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
portable good
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
anyone thank you for the update sure um
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
and just the other thing I'd share in
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
terms of the
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
redetermination efforts um you know
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
we're we're fairly much I think we're
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
within a couple percent of or hundreds
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
of people at this point of completing
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
the process of redetermining
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
people um the last few months in terms
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
of both the people about there were 100
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
about almost 104,000 people that we
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
who hadn't because of the uh pandemic um
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
and and the regular renewals now that um
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
the last three months have seen the
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
highest rate of retention um in the the
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
the regular renewals last month we had
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
89 and a half% of the people retain uh
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
coverage we're still doing a lot of
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
Outreach uh particularly in the
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable areas we've slowed down to
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that people who are like Home
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
and Community Based service oriented um
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
long-term care that we've given them an
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
extra 60 days to to help complete their
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
redeterminations we've um working with
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
the CFI case managers um trying to give
 
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
them more information so that they can
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
help people this has been the most
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
challenging group to work with because
 
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
they not only have to provide income
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
information but they often have to
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
provide information about assets and and
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
get bank account information and they
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
may not have done that for the last
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
three and a half years and um then there
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
are also people who've aged out of the
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program and trying to help them
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
get into Medicare and and signed up for
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
the right things there um but um you
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm pleased with the progress
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we've made and and I think we'll be
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
the better for it uh going forward in
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
terms of what we've learned um by having
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
to manage this and um you know if you
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
hear of someone that's having a
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
challenge I want to hear about it and um
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll try to do what we can to
 
00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.550 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll try to do what we can to
help

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%

commission members uh determined what
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
these were and set the path for us going
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
forward Bo um at the bottom you have the
 
00:40:30.109 --> 00:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
list of the commission members who put
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
the work into developing this report and
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
and who approved the report in November
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
we've since had some transition to some
 
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.109 align:start position:0%
we've since had some transition to some
commission

00:40:38.109 --> 00:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
members if you turn to the next page
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
page four um you'll see um a list of the
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
commission activities over the previous
 
00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
year and then page five begins to dive
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
into the priorities the commission has
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
identified for New Hampshire three of
 
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
the four of them are the same as the
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh strengthen systems of care for
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
healthy aging grow the Direct Care
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce Advance age-friendly policy
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
systems and environments and the new one
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
for this year is a call for the
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
development of a multi- sector plan for
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
Aging in New
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you turn to the next page
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
you begin to see how um we dive into
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
each of these priorities um we start
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
with a very brief description of what
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
the priority recommendation is then we
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
dive into the progress on on that
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
particular recommendation over uh that
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
was made in the legislature of the
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
previous year you'll see you'll see the
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
summary of the wonderful work that you
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
did uh and then what follows is the list
 
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
of recommendations for next steps that
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
the commission has identified for New
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so then jumping to the back of
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
the report page it's the page
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
21 um it looks like this um you'll see a
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
demographic snapshot of of new Hampshire
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
looking at at older adult
 
00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:03.160 align:start position:0%
populations um New Hampshire is the
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
second oldest state in the Union by
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
median age over 27% of the state's
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
population in 2020 is aged 60 and older
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
one in two households in New Hampshire
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
has one or more persons aged 60 and
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
older where New Hampshire is now is
 
00:42:22.109 --> 00:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
where many other states in the union
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
expect to be in 2035 we really are on
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
the The Cutting Edge of the
 
00:42:28.589 --> 00:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
transformational demographic
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
shift if you look down to the middle of
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
the page you can see um where older
 
00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:35.720 align:start position:0%
adults live here in New Hampshire um
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
Carol County uh has the greatest density
 
00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
of older
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
adults per capita and then if you look
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
on the right you can see um what we all
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
would expect that Hillsboro County um
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
has the lar largest raw numbers of older
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
adults and then at the bottom of the
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
page is what I think um you as
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
legislators might be most interested in
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
it shows
 
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
um it provides a
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
um a graph of anticipated Trends the
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
numbers rise for ages 65 plus through
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
2050 it's really that graph that drives
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
um what we need to plan for and why the
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
commission was
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
created and if you turn to the second to
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
the last page you'll see a letter from
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
governor Nunu uh um offering support for
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
the development of um a multi- sector
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
plan for aging it's it's he has seen
 
00:43:35.549 --> 00:43:35.559 align:start position:0%
that uh that Trend graphed on the
 
00:43:35.559 --> 00:43:36.990 align:start position:0%
that uh that Trend graphed on the
previous

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
page um and then the last page of the
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
report is a timeline shared by the
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
back in August on for the implementation
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
of the system of care for healthy aging
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed last session
 
00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh and now at this point I'm going to
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
turn the mic over to um the commission
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
chair Su Ruka who will introduce herself
 
00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
and provide a little a little bit of a
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
deeper dive into some of the um
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
priorities that are listed in this plan
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you thank you Rebecca for that
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
ni really nice overview and thank you
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
for having us here today um we really
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'm Sue rer and I'm the
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
chair of the commission I live in the
 
00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:14.839 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington Valley I've a nurse by
 
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
background and I have worked in the
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
field of Aging for many years before I
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
became an older adult myself I was
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
working in the field of Aging um and I'm
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
very passionate about it and committed
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
to being sure that we deliver we have
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
people who are living in New Hampshire
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
have the best quality of life we can
 
00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
they can possibly have no matter what
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
age um when I Was preparing for this um
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
presentation I was looking through our
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
the one of the values that jumped out at
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
me and in the beginning of the report
 
00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:47.319 align:start position:0%
you see that we have our values is
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
forward thinking and I think that's the
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
we are right now and it's also
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
modernizing aging we really do need to
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
switch our view of how we view older
 
00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:56.470 align:start position:0%
switch our view of how we view older
adults

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
um and how we view aging um or we're not
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
going to be successful as Rebecca gave
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
you all the statistics and we are we are
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
leading the country in terms of figuring
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
out what to how to provide quality of
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
life for people who are as they age um
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
we if we don't we can continue the same
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
way but if we don't we're not going to
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
have the resources to not only provide
 
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
care but neither are we using the value
 
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
and wisdom of older adults and many of
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
us in this room can prove that we're
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
very vibrant and active and strong and
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
contribute a lot to the um to the
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
Forward Thinking in New Hampshire to the
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
economy um to many things so we need to
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
capitalize on the on the value of older
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
adults and not always seen it as a
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
liability which a lot of times is how it
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
comes across yes we are going to have to
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
be providing more care and more and it
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
may be more costly but there's also a
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
value on wisdom we have to figure out
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
how to better use that um um so we have
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
um as Rebecca said we have four
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
priorities now three are the same as
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
they were in the past um and then the
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
fourth one uh I'm not going to go into a
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
lot of detail under the accomplishments
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
it is in the report and there's really a
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
lot of work that it's been done by um
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
the task force by the commission by
 
00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:18.200 align:start position:0%
other members and by many of you because
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
many of you were the ones involved with
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
create crafting and um passing
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that move things forward um
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
and there been a lot done this year um
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
the report also has details that will
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
take you to links to give you even more
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
information and we're also a resource
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
we're always here so feel free to if
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
there's more information that you want
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
to know about something you can reach
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
out to us um the first priority
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
strengthening the system of care um I
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
just want to bring your attention to the
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
graphs on page seven um and that's
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
showing that Phil um scull slon did
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
these um from the policy Institute it
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
shows the Appropriations for Medicaid um
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
from 2011 and Beyond not saying that
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
2011 was correct but it was a start and
 
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
the trend is interesting um when you
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
look at it most of the investment has
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
been in facility based care and yet we
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
know people want to be at home and we
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
also know that home care and adult day
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
centers are less costly options for
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
people that they can remain at home
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
longer um so but that was a the
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
interesting tend that we've invested
 
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
more facility based care not to say that
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
facility based care is needed for some
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
people and I ran a a nursing home for
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
quite a few years as well so it's
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate for some people but
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's premature admission or
 
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary for some people so we
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
need to balance it out and really look
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
at home and Community Based care which
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
is where people want to be and I think
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
the pandemic also disproved how much
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
people want to be at home
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
um just highlighting a few of the
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
accomplishments um and many of you were
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
involved with this increasing the
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
payment to providers for Medicaid for
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
Home and Community Based care for the
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
long-term care aspects of um Home Care
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
um was was great this year and there
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
were a few agencies um on the verge of
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
closing if they hadn't got some increase
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
in payment um excuse
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
me and also sorry also um streamlining
 
00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
the application process for Medicaid and
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
making it easier for families it was a
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
burden for families to be pulling all
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
that and cutting it to a three-year look
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
back unless there's an issue and a few
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
of the other things um really make
 
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
making it easier for people to be able
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
to get on Medicaid and also be able to
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
get the Home and Community Based
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
Services quicker rather than just
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
facility based care um Page 6 to8 goes
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
through the accomplishments that we've
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
we've done just a few other noteworthy
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
ones where increased funding for Meals
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
on Wheels which is sometimes the um the
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
main contact that somebody living at
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
home who is socially isolated has with
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels and with the cost of
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
food going up um some there was some
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
increased funding for that and also some
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
work on housing um the I want to just
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
focus on a little bit on the next steps
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
which start on page nine um now that the
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
foundation's in place um we really want
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
to over we need we need your assistance
 
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:16.599 align:start position:0%
in overseeing the robust implementation
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
of it um and also to continue to develop
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure um the infrastructure
 
00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:25.799 align:start position:0%
so but there there's a lot of um things
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
that was set in motion this year and the
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
implementation of that will be really
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
important um we also uh looking at like
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
home modification programs so that
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
people can stay at home um is another
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
important um priority um determining the
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
needs of caregivers uh really doing a
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
good assessment getting people hooked up
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
with services and supports early on so
 
00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:49.880 align:start position:0%
they can make better decisions about
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
what they want um and then piloting some
 
00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
models that have been tested and have
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
been success uccessful we've looked at
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
several and there were SE there were
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
quite a few identified in the report um
 
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:02.440 align:start position:0%
and some models that that were
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
successful so people can remain in the
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
community of choice um and have the
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
support and services they need for a
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
longer period of time um and then the
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
Direct Care Workforce um which leads us
 
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
into the next priority so everybody's
 
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
focusing on uh Workforce because
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce is a problem across the entire
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
country and and then New Hampshire is
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
well um but we focused on the commission
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
more on the direct for work force those
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
that are actually providing care to
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
older adults um living at home or in
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
facilities um if you just point you to
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
the graph on page 10 and it shows the
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
decline from 2022 to 2023 in
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
particularly lnas and registered nurses
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
um the licensed nursing assistants and
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
registered nurses so we have less in the
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
field now and we're going to need about
 
00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
24,000 more direct care workers by 2028
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
so that is definitely heading Us in the
 
00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
so that is definitely heading Us in the
wrong

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:07.589 align:start position:0%
wrong
direction

00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
um Pages 11 through 13 go through more
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
step more on what the work that's been
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
done over this last year and there been
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
tremendous accomplishments and and as I
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
said many of you are familiar with it
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
and you've been involved in making sure
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
that it happened um if I look for next
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
steps um you know when we're talking
 
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
talk about Direct Care Workforce access
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
to affordable housing child care and
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
transportation are some of the major
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
barriers why our direct um care
 
00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
Workforce is low um living on Lower
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
wages they can't afford housing I live
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the Mount Washington Valley you know
 
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
a tourist area and you can't find
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
housing for a family for anything less
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
than 2,000 a month and you know that's
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable if it can find that so um
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
housing is is
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
the excuse me housing is really the
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
underlying root problem of many many
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
things and the most difficult one to
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
really um grasp but there are there are
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
some um pilot programs and some other
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
things things like home share and other
 
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
stuff that are being done that we could
 
00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:11.799 align:start position:0%
really investigate and invest and invest
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
in more um tuition assistance and
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
support for training and advancement and
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
I was wonderful having the group that
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
presented ahead of us um because that's
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
a perfect example and I can tell you
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists for homing
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
Community Based care they can be amazing
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to keep people in their homes
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
um and more independent but um but
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
training and reimbursement uh there's
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
several programs that have been piloted
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
and started and again in the um on page
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
12 there's links to all of them um some
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
of them they were just showing some some
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
success and funding ran out so they
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
stopped but they could be picked up
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
again and invested in in a little bit um
 
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
um more um invested in more and then be
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
able to um um have more of a direct ha
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce sorry um and then um also um
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
some states have invested in building a
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
um a healthcare Workforce in investment
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
and Innovation um fund so it's another
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
way of looking at what would be
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
different options to really improve your
 
00:53:23.549 --> 00:53:23.559 align:start position:0%
direct a
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
Workforce um another option another
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
thing is removing barriers to licensing
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
um but not eliminating the license um
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
because and I know that sounds like a
 
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:37.720 align:start position:0%
catch 22 we want more of a Workforce but
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
we want we don't you know we talk about
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
licensing barriers however we have a
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
much more fragile um vulnerable
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
population people living longer with
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
more complex illnesses um and so you
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
have to balance out the need for the
 
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
volume of workers with with the safety
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
and making sure there's good oversight
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
for them so I you know not recommending
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
plus the licensed nursing assistants
 
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
themselves do not want the license
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
removed they feel that's a that's an
 
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
achievement they made and they're proud
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
of it and it helps keep them in that
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce and in that
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
field um the next um priority is um
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
ageef friendly policy systems and
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
environments I'm going to go through
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
this one quickly because I do want to
 
00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
give us time for questions at the end um
 
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
not and I'm going through it quickly not
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
because it's not as important but we've
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
it crosses so many sectors um when I
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
look at that you know the things that
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
jumped out at me you know we list the
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
accomplishments but reducing agism agism
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
is something that we're it's Insidious
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's arried in many many aspects in our
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
language and our policies and our
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
practices um and that is even when we
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
talk about Direct Care Workforce if
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're not valuing older adults and we
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
allow agism people aren't going to go
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
into the field we can make many many
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
things they have many people have um PE
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
workers have many options to go into why
 
00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
are they going to choose Healthcare
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
which is one of the more difficult ones
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the direct here direct here which is
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
very which is physically tiring and um
 
00:55:20.589 --> 00:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
and and a difficult profession unless we
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
really promote the value of older adults
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
and what they're doing um in the
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
workfield to um make life better for
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
people so I think agism to me we first
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
create we have to create greater
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
awareness and we have to do everything
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
we can to reduce agism um creating
 
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
age-friendly workplaces um rewarding
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
employees who um create them and um
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
modernize workplaces research the
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
research does show that a multi-age team
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
um is more productive but the research
 
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
also shows that age discrimin mination
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
is pretty high
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and um age friendly housing age ready
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
housing is important um as well so that
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
homes people can have their homes
 
00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:10.119 align:start position:0%
modified or that they're that we create
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
more housing that's age friendly um and
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
there looking at other piloting models
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
of care in alternative settings is a
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
great option and there been there's a
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
lot of Pilots out there that have been
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
successful um investing in technology um
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
and that's becomes even more and more
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
important um Broadband in in rural areas
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
and broadbanded areas where people don't
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
have it that's really important and I
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
know there's work being done on that but
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
also the other types of technology that
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
can keep keep people in their homes I
 
00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
was we did a conference recently and I
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
did not even realize this technology
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
that can tell somebody's Fallen this
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
technology that can you can use your
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
lecture and your sir to be able to um
 
00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
put prompts and reminders and check in
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
and and so in a an adult child living a
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
little more distantly can you know check
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
in on a parent and make sure that
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're okay and and they can
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
have there is going to be an increase in
 
00:57:06.029 --> 00:57:06.039 align:start position:0%
memory loss and dementia diagnosis so
 
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
people can have prompts that allow them
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
to be independent and stay at home
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
longer excuse me um so those are um
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
those are things that we should be
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
investing in um Civic engagement is
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
another one and I'm not going to go into
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
details on that but um making it easier
 
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
for older adults to participate in
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
things you know more virtual options um
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
you know quorums for um meetings that
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
can be virtual and in person so that
 
00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:36.200 align:start position:0%
people AR don't have the burden of
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
traveling and addressing social
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
isol isolation excuse me and finally I
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
just want to talk briefly a little bit
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
about the multi sector plan which is the
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
fourth priority and that was a new one
 
00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
for this year um people are living
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
longer and healthier lives um that's
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
called you know the long longevity
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
economy um we have more years of
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
disability Free Living so we have those
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
years to capitalize on and have older
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
adults that can be productive in the
 
00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:11.559 align:start position:0%
workforce you know by creating you know
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
um age-friendly Health Systems as I said
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
before um and making changes in
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
scheduling and policies so then older
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
adults are able to work longer bringing
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
older adults back into the workforce
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
they they were good you know a lot of
 
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:28.280 align:start position:0%
people can't really retire so if we can
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
make it easier and people can work U
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
maybe less hours um and making it easier
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
for older adults to stay in the
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
workforce um anyhow the um so that the
 
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
reasons around going back to the multis
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
sector plan there's a national movement
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
to really create an multi sector plans
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's going on in many states it's
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be a book that you
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
develop and put on the Shelf um it
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
should build on existing plans we have a
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
lot of plans we have the state plan on
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
Aging we have a state mental health plan
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
we have a state Transportation plan and
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
those are all great and what a multi
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
sector plan would be pulling them all
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
together because sometimes they're a bit
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
siloed and if we can pull them together
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
and have them um more cohesive and
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
everybody's knowing what's going on in
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
each of them we can we can really plan
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
for our state to be in better
 
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
shape um also Forward Thinking to be
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not only surviving but
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
thriving the multi- sector plan is
 
00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:29.240 align:start position:0%
usually a 10-year plan and sometimes
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
that's like well that's too long but we
 
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
want to it should be built so that
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
you're surviving and thriving through
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
whatever changes in politics whatever
 
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
changes in um you know who's in the
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
legislation who's in the governor's
 
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
office it survives that because it's a
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan plan that's agreed on that
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking for the future of the
 
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.230 align:start position:0%
we're looking for the future of the
state

00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
um on page 19 I'm just going to direct
 
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
you to there's five key elements in an
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
Alti sector plan um decisive leadership
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
it should be rational with data
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
comprehensive have stakeholders who are
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
bought into it and have accountability
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
built in it's usually a partnership with
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
public and
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
private we've been invited to be part of
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
a multi-state um learning collaborative
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
um Rebecca and Matha McLoud recently
 
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:23.240 align:start position:0%
went to California um for part of the um
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
the um training part the training
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
program but um it's a it's a
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
collaboration program some states are
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
ahead of us some states are are further
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
behind but it's an opportunity we have
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
to have some resource so we're not
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do it on on our own and making
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
it more a more efficient process um the
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
most successful ones have an executive
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
order from the governor and as Rebecca
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
said we already have a letter of support
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
um and we would be going after once we
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
have some more information and executive
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
water but it also requires the act of
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
participation by legislators um in
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
supporting the plan um by all of you and
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
what your constituents are telling you
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
um to bring be able to bring that
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
forward and then have it be um sent to
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
the commission and then you know we help
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
pull out that information together but
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
your your support in my it won't be
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
successful without the legislative
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
support we're going to need to uh wrap
 
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
it up now would you take any questions
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
you for the wonderful report it's uh
 
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
nice to hear about what we're doing here
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
thei one of the things that I see
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
happening at least in my neck of the
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
woods and talking to
 
01:01:47.309 --> 01:01:47.319 align:start position:0%
constituents is housing and aging in
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
place is part of it but a lot of times
 
01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:53.039 align:start position:0%
the house they reside in today as they
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
age is something sometimes a challenge
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
because they have to encounter stairs
 
01:01:59.230 --> 01:01:59.240 align:start position:0%
they go up to the bedrooms with the
 
01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
bathrooms are too small and so forth is
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
there any thought anywhere of trying to
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
work with seniors to
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
create affordable housing for the
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
elderly I think it does a couple things
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
one is it provides them the social part
 
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
it provides them with housing and so
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
forth that would help them to live
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
longer and and be free if you will but
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
at the same time if they vacate their
 
01:02:26.430 --> 01:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
home their today that's another home
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
that goes on the market so it's a double
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
win because it's a place they can go to
 
01:02:32.589 --> 01:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
to solve some of their problems I know
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
we have Contin care retirement
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
communities but most people can't afford
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
it so where's the hybrid where's the
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
compromise there to try to find ways to
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
help our elderly live in housing that's
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
something they can afford at the same
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
time manage B upon their disabilities
 
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
and try to free up the market and saying
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
well all of a sudden we have an
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
additional house on the market
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh that's an excellent question um the
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
state is doing a lot of investment into
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
housing invest NH for example um I think
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
we have to think about housing
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
holistically and that any new housing
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
that gets built needs to be age ready
 
01:03:12.269 --> 01:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
which means uh a step-free entry and a
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
bath and a bedroom on the first floor
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
the US Census just came out with report
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
New England of course has the oldest
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
housing housing stock in the country and
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
so if we if we don't just think about
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
okay we're building houses for elderly
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
more this is how we want to build
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
housing here here in New Hampshire and
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
it really serves all populations better
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a that's the approach
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
take um so so oh go ahead go ahead no I
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
I just was just adding you know our key
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
ask for for uh for us legislators is is
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
to join our call for the development
 
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
development of this multisector plan and
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
to engage in its creation because the
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
commission that was created we can go
 
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
off and have all these great ideas but
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
if if there we need ideas that that
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
policy makers like yourself um know will
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
work for New Hampshire and are willing
 
01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
to implement um and and um and we need
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
and so we need everybody's help in
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
creating it so that's why we're we're
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
calling for this multis sector plan and
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
and for you know to engage in a process
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
that will engage you in its
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
creation any other
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you and

the term Hai going forward it's a
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
mouthful um this is a legislatively

01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon we have just released

online the 14th report of the occurrence
 
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:54.039 align:start position:0%

talking points and then only the
 
01:06:17.309 --> 01:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
executive summary of each report in your
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
packets because they're very long
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
reports we'll make sure to send those
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
out in the final updated link uh but
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
those have been sent to you but I just
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
for brevity and to save resources we
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
kept it brief this is the 10th year over
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
10 years we've been reporting on these
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
um so I will really highlight certain
 
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
components of each report and then I
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
also have a disclaimer that there are
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
many acronyms and complex terms but I
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
will also introduce both um in the
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
beginning for an initial Clarity for
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
Hospital reports hospitals are required
 
01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:47.799 align:start position:0%
to report central line bloodstream
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
infections and catheter Associated urine
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
tract infections in intensive care units
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
and surgical site infections following
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
certain and heart colon knee and
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
abdominal hysterctomy surgeries
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals are also required to report
 
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Personnel influenza
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates overall New Hampshire
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
observed significantly fewer infections
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
than predicted based on National Data
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
overall 129 infections were reported by
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals for
 
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
2021 uh which is 68.89% fewer than
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
predicted there are significant fewer
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
infections for Ur urin tract infections
 
01:07:22.109 --> 01:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
and surgical sight infections overall
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
when compared to national data
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
compliance with measures that put that
 
01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
are put in place to protect patients was
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
also high so for example Healthcare
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
vaccination coverage in hospitals was
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
90.4% which means the healthy people
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
2020 goal of 90% And is an increase from
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
the prior prior year there were a total
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
of 802 clas defal or C infections
 
01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
reported however program was unable to

centers for 2022 which is actually
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
considered lower than National Data and

vaccination rate was 87.7% a slight
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
decreas from the prior year but still
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
close to to 90% healthy people 2020 goal
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
adherence of surgical into microbial

prophylaxis also remained high at 96%
 
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
and that has been high since we started
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
collecting these data in
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
2012 for dialysis centers this is the
 
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
first report 18 centers reported
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
bloodstream infections in 2022 and the
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
number of overall infections was
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
considered significantly lower compared
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
to National
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
Data hang on for a second I think uh one
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
of my one of our Representatives wanted
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
to ask something before sure too pass it
 
01:09:26.789 --> 01:09:26.799 align:start position:0%
representative Weber go ahead thank you
 
01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the Indulgence um I
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
just had a quick question with respect
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
to ambulatory Centers before we go on
 
01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
you said there were a couple of centers
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
that don't report are they required to
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
report or is this all voluntary
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
information and if they're not reporting
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
and supposed to what are we doing about
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
it that's a good question and that's why
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
I had this talking point in here so they
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
are all required every license facility
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
that is performing those procedures
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
is required to report under our statute
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
RSA 151 we have been ongoing trying to
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
reach out to these facilities and our
 
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
program is actively working to try to
 
01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
engage with these facilities um and it's
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
and some other centers have also
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
struggled um some Nursing Home Centers
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
as well we struggled to uh contact to be
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
able to have reporting a lot of
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information when we have
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
reached out to facilities after we had
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
some delayed reporting is primarily due
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
to St transition in Staffing so our team
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
is making a very concerted effort to
 
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
contact all of those facilities mostly
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
by phone to ensure that we have the
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
correct reporting contact so we're
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
making a very um large effort coming
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
into 2023 to be able to contact those
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
facilities is it the case that in any
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
number one being one uh where they don't
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
report and there's anecdotal evidence
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
that we get some problems there what do
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
you do next in the facility if there's
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about infections in
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
their facility we we would probably
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
conduct an infection control assessment
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's certain tools that are
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
standardized that we can use they're
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
standardized across the country and we
 
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
have also made them more specific to our
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire setting and our our uh Hai
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
program has staff that are trained to
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
conduct these including nursing staff so
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
we'll go on site and conduct an
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
infection control assessment try to
 
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
understand their gaps um identify their
 
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
strengths and be able to provide
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations to them thank you yeah
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
please continue thank you good questions
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
for dialysis centers 18 reported
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
bloodstream infections in
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
2022 um but overall that number was low
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
there were 379 bloodstream infections
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
reported in dialysis centers there were
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
fewer infections observed following
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
certain dialysis access sites however
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
certain access sites such as local
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
access site infections access related
 
01:11:43.709 --> 01:11:43.719 align:start position:0%
bloodstream infections and Vascular
 
01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
access site infections they were
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than expected
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Personnel influenza
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
vaccination in those centers was
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
55.0% which is a slight decrease from
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
the prior year vaccination coverage
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
ranged in dialysis centers from 23.3% to
 
01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
69.5% and for long-term care facilities
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
for the six report all long-term cares
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
are required to report Healthcare
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
Personnel influenza vaccination to DHHS
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
65 of these settings are long-term cares
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
reported for the 2022 to 2023 season
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Personnel influenza
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate in longterm care was
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
37.8% a decrease from 58.5% from the
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
prior season and as remained below the
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
healthy people 2020 goal of 90% since we
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
started collecting this information and
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
the coverage rate from long-term care
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
ranged from 0% to 100% so there's quite
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
a range some other program activities
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
that may answer some of your questions
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
of how we're addressing infections in
 
01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
these settings is that our program also
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
conducts investigations across the
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
healthc care Spectrum um we conduct
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
investigations through any outbreaks
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
that are reported infection control
 
01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
breaches drug diversion of in injectable
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
medications and we we also investigate
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
any antimicrobial resistant pathogens or
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
organisms that may be concerning to
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
Public Health we have also helped uh
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
with other investigations and conducted
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
seven infection control assessments uh
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
we are also working on a new
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative called project first line
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
to bring effective infection control
 
01:13:11.550 --> 01:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
training to Frontline healthcare workers
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
and this year we provided a train the
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
trainer program for direct education to
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
healthcare workers and infe
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
preventionists we also received a grant
 
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh to provide infection control
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
trainings to correction officers and
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
purchase environmental cleaning
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
equipment for correction settings in
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
their healthcare clinics our program is
 
01:13:31.149 --> 01:13:31.159 align:start position:0%
also working on antimicrobial resistance
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
activities to try to uh coordinate
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide efforts to prevent and detect
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
it including response plans for certain
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
drug resistant organisms we also respond
 
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
to reports of various antibiotic
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
resistant organisms one called
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
carbapenam resistant ENT bacteria ACA
 
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
there are family of bacteria that are
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
resistance to certain types of
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
antibiotics in 2022 we confirmed
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
confirmed 67 of those cases and just
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
this year up to as of November 30th
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
we've identified
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
73 uh funding per RSA 150 134 I'm also
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
required and obligated to report on our
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
program cost to Health and Human
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
Services committee our program reporting
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
operating budget for State fiscal year
 
01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
2023 was 458,000 the program was awarded
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
over 381,000 through the epidemiology
 
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
laboratory capacity Grant however a
 
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
program also was a a supplemental Grant
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
over 3 years to support other
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
operational costs therefore no re
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
therefore due to all receipt of those
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds no fees were assessed for
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 2023 and we anticipate
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
not having additional fees over the next
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
couple years as we have those grants in
 
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
one of those grants I do want to note
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
for long-term care settings we were able
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
to work with our vendor to provide um
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
infection control training I think over
 
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
60 uh individuals are enrolled for
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
infection control training so they could
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
be potentially serve as infection
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
preventionists in other settings such as
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
in long-term care and we have over 200
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
individuals that have signed up through
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
this training and have committed uh to
 
01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
working in long-term care type settings
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
so in this coming year we look forward
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
to continuing our prevention work and
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
providing infection prevention training
 
01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:10.840 align:start position:0%
across the whole Continuum of Care
 
01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:13.639 align:start position:0%
making our surveillance data and our our
 
01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
um reports more efficient and also more
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly educating healthcare
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
workers and infection prevention and
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
also hopefully materials for patients as
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
well through consorti
 
01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
and then facilitating implementation of
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
cdc's core elements for stewardship for
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
preventing antibiotic resistant
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
organisms and lastly engagement with
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
those settings that we have struggled
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
with reporting as um thank you for
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
asking earlier particularly with
 
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers and longterm
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
care facilities due to transition that
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
they've had in their Staffing and that's
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
what I have for you today I'm happy to
 
01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and thank you again for
 
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
all of that information um sounds to me
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
like the dialysis centers are are an
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
area of concern based on the quick
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
overview that you gave us and I wonder
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
if there are any specific plans for
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
dealing uh both with um the infection
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
rates which are higher than expected and
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
and also the vaccination rates which
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
sound to me to be horrendous I mean if I
 
01:16:25.310 --> 01:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
were uh having that kind of a
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
vulnerability I don't want to go to a
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
place that has a
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
0% vaccination rate there there may be
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
other people who choose not that but I
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
it yeah that's a good question thank you
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
so we do have these reports that we
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
publish every year we will inform all
 
01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
those settings of their rates there's
 
01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
not only detailed data for our state as
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
a whole but also for each individual
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
facility so the purpose of these reports
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
are for healthare Consumer transparency
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
so healthare consumers can access these
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
reports and go to look at infection
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
rates at those settings so they are able
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
and willing to do that um but they are
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
lengthy reports so our program is also
 
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
always willing to assist anyone that
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
wants to look at them we also um can
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
reach out to those spe specific
 
01:17:17.790 --> 01:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
facilities and typically do if we see a
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
very high rate particularly if it's
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
statistically significantly higher than
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
what we'd expect for uh for that
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
particular setting or type of infection
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
I was just as a followup I think you've
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
sort of answered this but uh sounds like
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
the information although public is still
 
01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
kind of buried and I wondered if there's
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
any plans to make that more publicly
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
accessible and more easily searchable by
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
just person sitting down with their iPad
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
wanting to know yes and I I really thank
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
you for that question that has been a
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
challenge of this program we have over
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
one one report is over 150 pages long
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
and that's one of four um our goal is to
 
01:17:59.550 --> 01:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
make these much more consumer friendly
 
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
digestible we have talked about having
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
some sort of online dashboard but we
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
also want to make sure there is some
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
sort of print option for individuals
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
that may not have access to a computer
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
or just less familiar with navigating it
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
or their iPad so we we are still in some
 
01:18:16.270 --> 01:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
early preliminary conversations about
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
that within our program and um what we
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
have for resources for dashboards we do
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
hope that we can do that over the next
 
01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
year and hopefully next year or in the
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
next two years we aren't presenting
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
these big paper copy reports we have
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
more of an electronic version we can
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
point you
 
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
to did I hear you say that the infection
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
rate in New Hampshire hospitals is
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than the
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
average um in addition to the great work
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the hospital Association uh what
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
would you attribute that to no thank you
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes so you did hear me correctly they
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
are significantly fewer infections based
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
on National Data so we compare hospitals
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
with other like hospitals nationally so
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
that takes into multiple things into
 
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
account hospitals work very hard at
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
reducing their infection rates and our
 
01:19:09.229 --> 01:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
partners at facilities particularly
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
infectious preventionists spend a lot of
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
time analyzing and Reporting these data
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
to us but also boots on the ground
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
trying to ensure that prevention
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
prevention is in place so if there's an
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
individual that may be on contact
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
precautions they do rounding to ensure
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
that those individuals uh remain in care
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
and protected but also patients around
 
01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
them don't get that organism um they
 
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
also share data with their with their
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
providers um if there is a specific
 
01:19:36.990 --> 01:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
level of nuance of data that they can um
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
do that there's also various measures
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
put in place to put protect patients in
 
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
addition to the ones I shared here
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
around influenza vaccination but there's
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
certain um bundles that are often
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
implemented and many hospitals have
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
steps built into their electronic
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
medical record systems to ensure that
 
01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
those bundles are here to um so for
 
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
example central line insertions um in an
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
ICU they have what is called a clip
 
01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
bundle to ensure that certain measures
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
are put in place so patients do not have
 
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
a bloodstream infection as a result from
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
that central line good thank you uh any
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr chair and also
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question what I
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
found interesting is that most of the
 
01:20:19.510 --> 01:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
infections we're talking about through
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
out this report in bacterial nature yet
 
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
the report also is the measurement of a
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine for influenza which is a virus
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
MH so why are we pulling in influenza
 
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
for some monitoring capability but most
 
01:20:38.470 --> 01:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
of the infections we're talking about
 
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
are bacterial nature that's an excellent
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you so as you mentioned
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
most of these infections following
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
surgical sight infections bloodstream
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
infections they are all bacteria in
 
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
nature we also monitor compliance
 
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
measures or measures put in place that
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
can help protect patients and one such
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
measure is through immunization efforts
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
to prevent other infectious diseases
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
from circulating in a healthcare setting
 
01:21:02.350 --> 01:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
and influenza we have identified
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
outbreaks in various healthc care
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
settings of influenza primarily in
 
01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
nursing home settings um where most
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
years we do see I don't have the number
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head how many
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
outbreaks we have seen in in those
 
01:21:15.149 --> 01:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
settings but I could always pull that
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
and get it back to you follow up and
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that so do we I noticed in
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
the vaccination rates there is a range
 
01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
so what kind of correlation do we have
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
with somebody or facility that has a
 
01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
high vaccination rate does it have a
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
corresponding low infection rate so I
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't think we could really directly
 
01:21:39.149 --> 01:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
correlate low vaccination rate to low
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
infection rate or vice versa but we'd
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
have to be able to look directly at
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
influenza activity in that Health Care
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
Facility so particular relevant to that
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
we have been wanting to look into a
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
project to do that we have just not had
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
the capacity yet to do so we would like
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
to look at um outbreaks and B setting by
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccination rate um in in the
 
01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccination rate um in in the
future

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah good thank you thank you so much
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
and I will leave these copies for you
 
01:22:12.430 --> 01:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
okay next up tuition waiver for children
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
in State foster care or
 
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
guardianship we did that didn't we it
 
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
was at like deja vu all over again okay
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
that's say that sounds familiar okay
 
01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
next uh the Hampshire Health Officers

01:27:05.310 --> 01:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
us and I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you very much for this thank
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
you for coming today that's a wealth of
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
information I'm in trying to digest the
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
numbers on page one um I see the total
 
01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
health officers is two
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
27 uh that means that there are some
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
towns obviously that don't have health
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
officers of any sort and I'm wondering
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
2117 um are you counting only one Health
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
officer for example in Manchester I'm
 
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of the number of
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
towns that have no Health officers or
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
coverage if you have that information
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
you may not have it sliced and diced
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
that way okay there are a number of town
 
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
that do not have that do have vacancies
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons such as
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
retirements and so forth uh by by
 
01:28:03.390 --> 01:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
Statute uh if there is not an appointed
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
Health officer the board of Selectmen uh
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
act as health offic for that town so
 
01:28:11.790 --> 01:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
that is in place although there's not
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
someone who has been appointed do you
 
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
have information on the uh
 
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
number hi committee um my name is Sophia
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
Johnson and I'm the administrator for
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
the health officer liaison program at
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Public Health Services
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
and our program is responsible for
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
tracking um the number of Health
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
officers at any given time as well as
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
engaging that appointment process um so
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's interesting in that New Hampshire
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
towns are required to have a health
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
officer and that Health officer is
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by the state um New Hampshire
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
cities such as Manchester um do not have
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
to be appointed by the state they are
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
responsible for appointing their own
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
health officer so while we support them
 
01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily include them in our
 
01:28:53.510 --> 01:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
counting um the total that you see here
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
2117 is the one Health officer per Town
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
um and then under that number there are
 
01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:02.119 align:start position:0%
94 additional deputies so towns can have
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
an additional Health officer if they so
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
choose um but right now um we have about
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
a 12% vacancy rate um and unfortunately
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
um the towns from what I'm hearing it's
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
that it can be very hard to identify
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
somebody to serve in this town because
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
of the skill set it's a very vast um
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge that you need to serve in this
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
town so they often times don't have the
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
budget to bring in that person to fill
 
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
that role um uh yeah but at at any given
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
time you know we can provide you those
 
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
numbers follow up thank you our Our Town
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
vet has been our health officer for I
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
think probably centuries at this point
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's been a whole series of them but
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
clarification because that was exactly
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
what I needed to know does the health
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
officer have to live in the town that's
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
a great question um they do not um so
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
there are situations where one Health
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
officer let's say living in Pittsfield
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
can serve for the surrounding towns so
 
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
we have health officers who serve for
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
multiple communities yeah so that makes
 
01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
it easier if a small town doesn't have
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
one they may be able to join in with
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
someone else yes and we provide um my
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
program provides that guidance to towns
 
01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
so we help towns um navigate what
 
01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
options there are for bringing in a
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
health officer representative
 
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:23.480 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you Mr
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
are there any counties in New Hampshire
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
that backfill the communities with
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
health officer based upon the skill set
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about difficult in finding
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
it and finding someone at the county
 
01:30:36.109 --> 01:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
level that the towns can share
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
collectively is there any counties out
 
01:30:39.629 --> 01:30:39.639 align:start position:0%
there doing it so currently there's no
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
model like that and that's something
 
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
that we are exploring and we're working
 
01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
with the regional public health networks
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
to see is there an opportunity to employ
 
01:30:49.629 --> 01:30:49.639 align:start position:0%
a health officer at the regional level
 
01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
again something that's not happening as
 
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
of right now now but we're certainly
 
01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
looking into that um because the towns
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the the Personnel or the
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
funding to support this position in many
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
situations and what we find is that the
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
town elects the fire chief or somebody
 
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
from the police department um and so
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
then our programs are tasked with
 
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
bringing that person up to speed and the
 
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they need to serve in
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
that position
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
with Senator gray I if you're going to
 
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
do that you may want to get with Mr
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
Williams because there is leg ation
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
requested by the department to talk
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
about how they are appointed and that
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
legislation could be modified with your
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions should you be quick enough
 
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
that we can do that thank you for that
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.629 --> 01:31:43.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much I'm going to take
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
this home and plow through it thank you
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
