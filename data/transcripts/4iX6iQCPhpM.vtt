00:13:08.700 --> 00:14:36.769 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.750 align:start position:0%
we have
um

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
a work session scheduled uh a public
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
hearing on a non-germaine Amendment and
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
then originally the plan was to do an
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
executive session right after that and I
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to announce for everyone here
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
just in case you're in the obvious
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
audience for that exact session that we
 
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
will not be doing an executive session
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
today I apologize for that what we'll do
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
is we will schedule it for next Tuesday
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
which I believe is May 9th so if you're
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
interested in any of those bills that we
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
have left to exec we're going to move
 
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
that to next Tuesday to allow us to be
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
better prepared
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know what time I saw it probably
 
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
will be closer to 11 A.M because we also
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
have a request from someone who has a
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
medical appointment so we're trying to
 
00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339 align:start position:0%
work around that next week the one that
 
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
we must exec is an early bill and I
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
believe that's Senate Bill 120 that we
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
might be ready to do others at that time
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
but but we'll get together then so
 
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
no execs today so if you're here and
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're here for that reason then
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
you can go home and
 
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:07.820 align:start position:0%
make another breakfast or something
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
because you were here early yes
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
representative um um because I urge uh
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
this to actually be on Wednesday versus
 
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
Tuesday or the only Pro that problem is
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
a problem because we're now getting very
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
very close to the deadline so we could
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
do both maybe but I I'm I hate to wait
 
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:27.660 align:start position:0%
to the absolute last minute on an early
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
Bill deadline if that's okay
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
I think I might have to have a
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
replacement but uh Tuesday I can't make
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
it but okay let's
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
um representative plett did you have
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
something yeah I'm wrong or we start
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
early on the night you want to start
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
um could everyone be here closer to 9
 
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
A.M on Tuesday I just need a point of
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
order yes I have I rescheduled an
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
appointment that they will not
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
reschedule again for three which means I
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
leave here at 1 30 and I think the rule
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
is you have to be here all day to be in
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
the exact so just to be a matter of fits
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
in the morning I could do it okay so
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
you're talking about next Tuesday yes
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
okay could people be here at 9 00 a.m
 
00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
ish on next Tuesday does that work
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
yes okay good we'll try to get our
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
business done between nine a.m and what
 
00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:21.179 align:start position:0%
time did you need uh 3 15. oh okay so
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
between 9 and 1 30. right should give us
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
the time we need
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your accommodation
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate that okay with
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
without further Ado we will open up the
 
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
work session on Senate bill 112.
 
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:38.700 align:start position:0%
and oh we haven't really structured
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
anything for this but I believe
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative almi had an amendment she
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
may wish to discuss
 
00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:54.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
I don't believe I've seen any other
 
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
for the Republican benefit the
 
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539 align:start position:0%
Republican caucus because well I've
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
talked to all but one of the Democratic
 
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539 align:start position:0%
caucus uh yesterday uh in a zoom uh
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
there are complications behind 112 but I
 
00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:26.810 align:start position:0%
there are complications behind 112 but I
see

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.130 align:start position:0%
see
on

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
having to do with what seems to be the
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
the principal purpose of the sponsor
 
00:18:36.909 --> 00:18:36.919 align:start position:0%
uh Senator
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
which is to
 
00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
um assemble more money for problem
 
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.590 align:start position:0%
um assemble more money for problem
gaming

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
and get it to the lottery
 
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.930 align:start position:0%
and get it to the lottery
and

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that is as
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
the executive director knows I'm quite
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
sure on but the rest of us I think have
 
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:07.580 align:start position:0%
forgotten or never knew
 
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
there is on on the bill that did sports
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
betting they also created a council for
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
responsible gaming and instead of
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
putting it in the lottery section they
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
put it in the Commerce part of our laws
 
00:19:27.529 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
and so it's
 
00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:28.190 align:start position:0%
and so it's
um

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
and it's been ramping up and apparently
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
is going to start doing some good stuff
 
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.810 align:start position:0%
is going to start doing some good stuff
now

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
um but it was pretty quiet
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
on the internet I found no no that was
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
the other group there is a group that's
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
been around a lot longer
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
perhaps Charlie knows uh when they got
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
started but the Council on problem
 
00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.970 align:start position:0%
started but the Council on problem
gaming

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
which is a non-profit on run by a
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
three-person board I think it looked
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
like only two of them were active
 
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.650 align:start position:0%
like only two of them were active
um

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
which has been receiving the money for
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
problem gaming from Lottery
 
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:15.350 align:start position:0%
problem gaming from Lottery
uh

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and is now two of two
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the board are on the the five-person
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
board of the responsible gaming
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh the responsible gaming money comes
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
from an administrative expense of the
 
00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:33.049 align:start position:0%
from an administrative expense of the
lottery

00:20:33.049 --> 00:20:33.059 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
00:20:33.059 --> 00:20:34.370 align:start position:0%
lottery
and

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:39.539 align:start position:0%
on appropriated to them
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
in the in the lottery Appropriations in
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
and it can be up to two hundred and
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
the for the startup they gave them a
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand lately they've been
 
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
giving them uh well lately no in the
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
next budget they will be getting 250 000
 
00:20:59.210 --> 00:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
a year
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
the executive director could probably
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
explain better than I could what it's
 
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
like they are going to be working with
 
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers around New
 
00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:17.539 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh in developing programs
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
within them specifically to problem
 
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
gaming to to gambling addiction which
 
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.230 align:start position:0%
gaming to to gambling addiction which
um

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
is and then the other two people on it
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
are from Cambridge Massachusetts
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
I wasn't quite sure if it was came
 
00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
Cambridge England but
 
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
they they are professors I believe and
 
00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:45.059 align:start position:0%
they research on gambling there
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
it's um that so that group gets in a
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
direct appropriation in the budget and
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're administratively under the
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
lottery but the lottery doesn't uh I
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
think do
 
00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of work with them
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
might end up somehow
 
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
merging with this one or disappearing on
 
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.870 align:start position:0%
merging with this one or disappearing on
and

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
um that group has also I hadn't realized
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
until yesterday from lbao on on been
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
getting money from from the lottery
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
in a different way somehow but the
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
lottery was charged in a number of
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
places in the statutes without giving
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
them money for it on with doing
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
something about problem gaming
 
00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:54.900 align:start position:0%
when every time somebody put a new form
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
of gambling in they uh they were told
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
you ought to do something about problem
 
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.049 align:start position:0%
you ought to do something about problem
gaming

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:04.610 align:start position:0%
gaming
so

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.390 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
the question is my the amendment that I
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
was putting forward was to take all of
 
00:23:11.159 --> 00:23:12.830 align:start position:0%
was putting forward was to take all of
this

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
um was to take the money from this bill
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
paramutual racing and historic
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
horse racing
 
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.409 align:start position:0%
horse racing
um

00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:24.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
into a dedicated fund so that it would
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
be more visible
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
and ability more somewhat more ability
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
to figure out what they were doing
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
but that was before I knew all about
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
and I think now the situation is more
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
complicated we need discussions Lottery
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
Counsel on problem gaming on
 
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
on the and the people interested from
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
this committee and
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
um in adding a pudding instead
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
this could pass as it as it is and I
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
think not mess things up
 
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.590 align:start position:0%
think not mess things up
but

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and and then that part of it be done
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
but then we need to figure out
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
how how those agencies and the money
 
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
flowing to them
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
gets put together in such a way that the
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
money that
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
Senator ricciardi wanted to send to them
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't just replace part of the money
 
00:24:39.649 --> 00:24:39.659 align:start position:0%
that's already going to them
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
but also would
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
not be frugaled away and I'm sure that
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
the executive director is on top of this
 
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
in some ways
 
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.470 align:start position:0%
in some ways
so

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
so that's what I wanted to say
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful to hear from Lottery
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
of what what is going on with these
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
funds would you be available
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:11.940 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre I have the privilege of
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
being the director of New Hampshire
 
00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.270 align:start position:0%
being the director of New Hampshire
lottery

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
lottery
 
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:17.930 align:start position:0%
lottery
um

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
originally when
 
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:20.930 align:start position:0%
originally when
um

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
I believe was Keno was passed there was
 
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
a separate fund created
 
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
in HHS to address problem gaming and
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
that fund was funded by certain parts of
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
Aquino revenues
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
HHS didn't do anything with it for
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
and so that fund grew to be I think it
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
was eight hundred thousand dollars
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it just sat there and nothing
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
happened nothing happened and um
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu through his budget
 
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
office then created the council for a
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
problem responsible gambling that was
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
initially tied to us thinking we would
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
move faster and do things faster
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
um it is a bit
 
00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:02.810 align:start position:0%
um it is a bit
um

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's a bit difficult as you can imagine
 
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.330 align:start position:0%
it's a bit difficult as you can imagine
being

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
the chief bookie and then also having
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
administrarily tied the problem gambling
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
Council it's it's you know it's it would
 
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
be characterized into professions as
 
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.049 align:start position:0%
be characterized into professions as
bipolar

00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
bipolar
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
we they're initially tied dust car so
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
under the current law they're
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
administrarily tied to us so we help
 
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
them with things like purchasing and
 
00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
budgeting procurement they use our
 
00:26:30.529 --> 00:26:30.539 align:start position:0%
office space they use our facilities
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
their copy machines Etc
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
um but I don't have anything to do with
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
them as you can imagine I'd love to do
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
it but it doesn't make any sense it
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
would look unseemly uh and so there's
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
funding sources obviously as
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative Albany suggested but
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
unless it's similarly budgeted if we
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
make more like for example if this bill
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
passed and breakage was a million
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
dollars the remaining 750 would not go
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
to problem gambling it would go to the
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
general fund because it was budgeted for
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
two fifty thousand dollars and so
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
um that's has been the case for a number
 
00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419 align:start position:0%
of years of the revenue sources that
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
exists now and certainly as the person
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
who is in charge of regulating and
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
operating gambling in the state
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
um I would be delighted to help in any
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
way possible to promote more services
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
the council is now reaching out to train
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
essentially trainers in addressing
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
problem gaming
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
um it's a very small percentage of
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
people but it affects their lives deeply
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
it ends up being about one half percent
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
of the two percent of people who gamble
 
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
have a problem and I'll Define that let
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
me know air quote that it's that they
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
have an issue
 
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and need need services so
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
um that's the history of the where it is
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
now it is like I said initially tied to
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
us there are a number of groups have
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
only said there are a couple of
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
professionals who have done this as
 
00:27:57.529 --> 00:27:57.539 align:start position:0%
I believe they were psychologists uh
 
00:27:59.690 --> 00:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
professors they were certainly educated
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh who have done it now the council the
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
executive director is a former
 
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts correctional officer who
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
himself was a problem Gambler and he
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
lives in New Hampshire now he grew up in
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
Fall River
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
um and he runs it and he actually will
 
00:28:18.769 --> 00:28:18.779 align:start position:0%
answer calls from people on his cell
 
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
phone so folks who have a problem will
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
call and the council gets maybe a few
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
dozen calls a month from people who have
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
issues and they try to match those folks
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative Platt yes this is
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
directed to uh representative almi uh do
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
have we got a copy of that amendment
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
that you had
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
no it isn't
 
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:50.630 align:start position:0%
no it isn't
that

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
and what I understand it needs changing
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
but could I ask him a question first and
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
then we get to the procedural issue
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's a work session tour a little more
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
let's see great thank you uh does that
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
it sounds like what that is is if
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
breakage gets above 250 you're taking
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
money that was supposed to be going to
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
the ETF
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
no it goes to education trust fund all
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
of our revenues are by yeah you said g g
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
s oh I did I'm sorry my apologies I've
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
been misspoke it's the education trust
 
00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:38.690 align:start position:0%
been misspoke it's the education trust
fund

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay did you found it okay
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you all right and just to get back
 
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
to representative Almy are you happy
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
with this amendment as is
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
I am happy with this amendment as is on
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
the thing that I'm wondering about as I
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
understood representative plant was
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
trying to work on each wager
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
that language
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
the redistribution of each wager instead
 
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
of based on each dollar wage wagered
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
and so I thought there were going to be
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
two amendments we were looking at
 
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative plett do you have
 
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment on this bill
 
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
I have the one that she said it was in
 
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:27.620 align:start position:0%
front of me and it was
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
one of yours one of mine yeah what did I
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
do you're going to work on on the the
 
00:30:36.169 --> 00:30:36.179 align:start position:0%
whether we should
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
why we should change based on each
 
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
dollar wagered to of each wager no no
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.930 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
did you work on it would would it be
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
possible first since we first started
 
00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
with representative almie's Amendment
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
could you walk us through the whole
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
thing just so we fully understand it and
 
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
we can ask you questions and then if
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate then maybe
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative fellows you can tell us
 
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
I was just answering my question about
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
where that came from but I think we have
 
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
kind of like two totally different
 
00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
issues going on here one of them is we
 
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
started kind of with a discussion of
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the problem
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
gambling and the money related to that
 
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
and then the the other issue in in my
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
mind is the language that we have about
 
00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
breakage because from what I have been
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
able to learn and I you know I did some
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
research is that the language in both
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and in rules about breakage
 
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.649 align:start position:0%
the bill and in rules about breakage
doesn't

00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:49.389 align:start position:0%
doesn't
um

00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
does not reflect
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
how breakage is actually calculated and
 
00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
and probably but I don't know for sure
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
what's actually occurring with the
 
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.269 align:start position:0%
what's actually occurring with the
breakage

00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
breakage
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
so those to me are sound like two
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
totally different issues I think we
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
should do one at a time
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
yes I agree two totally different issues
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
in here and hopefully we can sift
 
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
through that I have heard there is
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
ongoing problems with that language on
 
00:32:15.659 --> 00:32:16.970 align:start position:0%
ongoing problems with that language on
breakage

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:16.980 align:start position:0%
breakage
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
so it may be something that has to be
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
worked on more than just a day
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
so we'll see about that and then maybe
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
this bill turns into something else I
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know because we'll
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
have to see so do you want to walk us
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
through your Amendment
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh yes it's uh it's easier referring to
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
my yellow
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
piece because on they read as usual they
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
redid the whole thing and so it's hard
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
to tell what the original Bill changed
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
and what I changed but the first piece
 
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:55.940 align:start position:0%
of it is on line 19.
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
8 19 no eight
 
00:33:03.289 --> 00:33:03.299 align:start position:0%
uh no 19
 
00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:06.710 align:start position:0%
uh no 19
um sorry

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.169 align:start position:0%
 
where

00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
where does this thing it looks to me
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
like the first change you're making is
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
on line 2223 of the amendment oh yeah
 
00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
there it is thank you on I'm
 
00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:28.730 align:start position:0%
there it is thank you on I'm
um

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
what I did was to
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
add take out
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
and used his payment
 
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:39.860 align:start position:0%
and said instead
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
both of them say paid to the Lottery
 
00:33:45.409 --> 00:33:45.419 align:start position:0%
Commission I took out as used and used
 
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
as payment and I replaced it with to be
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
deposited in the problem gaming fund
 
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:52.820 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
284-22c which I create at the end
 
00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.810 align:start position:0%
284-22c which I create at the end
um

00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
and really most of this except for that
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
part at the end is
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
um doing exactly the same thing in the
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
others the next one is line six on page
 
00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.750 align:start position:0%
others the next one is line six on page
two

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
takes out and use this payment adds in
 
00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:20.339 align:start position:0%
to be deposited in the problem gaming
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
fund under RC 284-22c
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
and then the third one is
 
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:28.970 align:start position:0%
and then the third one is
in

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.369 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:36.649 --> 00:34:36.659 align:start position:0%
on line 20
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
on takes out and uses payment and
 
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
replaces it with to be deposited in the
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
problem gaming fund under RSA 284 22c
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
then when you get to Historic horse
 
00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.710 align:start position:0%
then when you get to Historic horse
racing

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
racing
 
00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.609 align:start position:0%
racing
um

00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:52.619 --> 00:34:55.669 align:start position:0%
um
which

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:00.859 align:start position:0%
it um yeah line
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
30 yes uh it it takes out and used as
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
payment well I guess that's exact almost
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the same thing and used as payment for
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
problem gaming services and it instead
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
says paid to the Lottery Commission to
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
be deposited in that fund and uh then
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
there is a new section
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.230 align:start position:0%
at the end
on

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
after section 22 B
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
which creates section 22c problem gaming
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
fund and that's found on page three in
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.790 align:start position:0%
the amendment
and

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
it defines it as provided providing
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
funding for the identification and
 
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:49.460 align:start position:0%
treatment of problem game gamblers
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing continually appropriated
 
00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:57.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
and the fund shall receive all the
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
monies from breakage under everything
 
00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
that is in this bill
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and then it creates which is where I
 
00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:14.180 align:start position:0%
started it creates a 612 uh
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
notation so that the problem gaming fund
 
00:36:20.569 --> 00:36:20.579 align:start position:0%
is in the list of
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.530 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
um

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
and when you do a dedicated you add a
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund they always give it
 
00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:33.260 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
387 would be the next one since last
 
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.050 align:start position:0%
387 would be the next one since last
year

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
but there may be three different ones
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
coming in and
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
um in enrolled bills they would change
 
00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
the 388 to whatever number it comes up
 
00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:53.660 align:start position:0%
to be there are about
 
00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:55.859 align:start position:0%
120 I think
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that we have repealed
 
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
since we started doing enumeration
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
it used to be alphabetical
 
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.810 align:start position:0%
it used to be alphabetical
uh

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
and so we really don't have 387 in
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
existence right now but it's up there
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so that that's that's what I was
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
doing and so can I just ask though so
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
right now we all we already have
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
a problem gaming fund effectively or for
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
the course they have two in the state
 
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.450 align:start position:0%
the course they have two in the state
what

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh they're talking right now but um what
 
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
happened to the 400 000 odd dollars that
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
were sitting in HHS
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
and not being used that that uh Mr
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
so this is the kind of thing that that
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
bothers me in I in dedicated funds that
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
we're always needing to try to you know
 
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:06.839 align:start position:0%
get different things that different
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
people were doing at different times
 
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
and put them together in the same place
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
if they're trying to do the same thing
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
and one of them isn't doing anything
 
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.050 align:start position:0%
and one of them isn't doing anything
yeah

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:17.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yeah
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
on Mr McIntyre we were getting in the
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
Weeds on this uh problem gaming fund
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
question and uh so this amendment would
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
make a new problem gaming fund to deal
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
with all the breakage as mentioned in
 
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
what so can you update us on that money
 
00:38:41.089 --> 00:38:41.099 align:start position:0%
that was in the other fund because what
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
we don't want to end up having is three
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
different funds yeah doing you know
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure this out the HHS
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
fund so that fund actually was never
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
expended and dropped at the bottom line
 
00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
as a transfer to the education trust
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
fund oh it did correct yes and
 
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
fundamentally there'd be no need to send
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
a fund you could just literally have an
 
00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579 align:start position:0%
expense on our bottom line for problem
 
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
gambling and we would just spend it
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
there's no need for it obviously it's
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
your prerogative but a dedicated fund is
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
unless you don't want to make change the
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
nature of the funds because obviously if
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
it didn't spend the year would lapse so
 
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.550 align:start position:0%
it didn't spend the year would lapse so
but

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
um if you change the budget to increase
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
or that amount it would be would
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
obviously set it aside and spend it
 
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
right so that's one of the questions is
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
do we really want it to be non-lapsing
 
00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
if it's never spent for a couple of
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
years while people are figuring out what
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's needed for well fundamentally that
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
was the problem at first there's no
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
question it was not used it went to HHS
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
which obviously had a very large
 
00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:40.619 align:start position:0%
construct and had difficulty creating a
 
00:39:40.619 --> 00:39:41.810 align:start position:0%
construct and had difficulty creating a
separate

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
separate
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
small thing so yeah but now it is
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
actually active and is spending funds
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
and providing Services although limited
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh represent homie did you have more to
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
add on that no I think I okay
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.069 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
I guess one question I have is
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
how big
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
how big is breakage because of breakage
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
if all breakage is going into this fund
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
I mean is it is it too much yes so I
 
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.150 align:start position:0%
I mean is it is it too much yes so I
guess

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea so the question is
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
we've actually think of the question
 
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative we've literally discussed
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
in that when I was seated back with my
 
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.069 align:start position:0%
in that when I was seated back with my
colleague

00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
colleague
 
00:40:30.349 --> 00:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
um currently it would just be around 250
 
00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:32.210 align:start position:0%
um currently it would just be around 250
ironically

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
ironically
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
um it would be our expectation that that
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
number would grow
 
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339 align:start position:0%
based on historical expressing
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
increasing revenues monthly and new
 
00:40:43.069 --> 00:40:43.079 align:start position:0%
facilities coming online so I think it
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
would be just about what you would is
 
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
budge in the budget now
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
um but it would be larger and next
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
representative fellas
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm still not clear on when you're
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
talking about HHS what are you talking
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
about sure
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
um representative the
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
when Kina was originally passed in 2000
 
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.810 align:start position:0%
when Kina was originally passed in 2000
and

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:10.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
16 17.
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
the sale of keynote tickets
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
um a percentage of the revenues was
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
dedicated towards a problem gambling and
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
that money was set aside in a fund that
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
was administered by HHS
 
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
they never did anything with it the
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
number the fund just grew and continued
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
to grow and so it was just a
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
a growing fund and so when it
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
transferred to us
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
that those funds dropped to our bottom
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
line is a transfer it went to the
 
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
education trust fund as essentially
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
revenues of the lottery and so now
 
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
the funding of the problem gambling
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
commission or council is done through
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay so really that's that is not in the
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
picture currently correct so so my my
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
real question here has to do with
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
um the amount of money going to
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
problem gambling issues and
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
if it's gonna if the amount is going
 
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
going to increase you know what what
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
does it really need to increase because
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
what exactly is going on so one of the
 
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
things I did I did some research and I
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
first of all to help everybody
 
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
understand there are two New Hampshire
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
councils related to gambling and one of
 
00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:41.579 align:start position:0%
them's called is New Hampshire Council
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
on responsible gambling and that is a
 
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
commission that the members are
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor
 
00:42:53.450 --> 00:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
and then there's another one that's
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
called New Hampshire Commission on
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
so the second one is called New
 
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on problem gambling
 
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
and that's a non-profit institution and
 
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
that the um the commission for
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
responsible gambling
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't really I mean they meet but they
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
have a to get the work done they have a
 
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
contract with the commission on problem
 
00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:30.740 align:start position:0%
gambling which is the non-profit
 
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
so I looked at reports about what's
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
going on with that in the expenditures
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
and I looked at their website which had
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
minimal information one of the things it
 
00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
did is it listed
 
00:43:46.609 --> 00:43:46.619 align:start position:0%
places where you could go to Gamblers
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
Anonymous meetings only one was in New
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the other ones were in Maine
 
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts
 
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
on one page I looked at it and there was
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
a link on I guess their Partners down at
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
the bottom that said drug and alcohol
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
and I clicked on that and it went to
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of ad for gambling
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
which is means the website I don't know
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
been hacked or sounded I'm sure that was
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
not the intent
 
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
it's I don't know some kind of hacking
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
or something went on with that which is
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
like you know that that would be very
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
some people would think that would be
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
very funny obviously
 
00:44:29.809 --> 00:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
so I'm just concerned that and I looked
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
at some of the minutes of the meetings
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
and their you know they get calls from
 
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:35.170 align:start position:0%
and their you know they get calls from
Maybe

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:35.180 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
15 people with gambling problems
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
over a couple of months and it just if
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to put more money in this I
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
think maybe there should be some more
 
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.609 align:start position:0%
think maybe there should be some more
specifications

00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
specifications
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
on how it's used and and also the fact
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
that one person is on both of these
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
councils and I've never heard of a
 
00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
situation where a council would have
 
00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
be responsible for a contract
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
with the person that's on the council it
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
just it seems irregular to me
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
these are my concerns certainly so
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
they're administratively tied to us and
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't we don't manage them
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
I have no responsibility as you can
 
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
imagine because of the in both of them
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
literally what comes the problem we just
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
make the money in this context and and
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
suspended and our CFO reviews their
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
expenditures our chief compliance
 
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
officer helps them with Contracting and
 
00:45:35.569 --> 00:45:35.579 align:start position:0%
permit uh not permitting but if there's
 
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579 align:start position:0%
a a council matter like the executive
 
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
Council matter that does the
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
so if you ask questions about their
 
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
operations you're gonna have to ask the
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
the them
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know we don't want to grill
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
the director here but um maybe maybe
 
00:45:53.089 --> 00:45:53.099 align:start position:0%
this is something we have to work on in
 
00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
a different bill as representative almie
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned because and maybe we asked
 
00:45:59.329 --> 00:45:59.339 align:start position:0%
those folks you know what the details
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
are representative fellows yes but the
 
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:04.460 align:start position:0%
the chair of the Council of
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
responsible gambling is an employee of
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
the lottery exactly yes so and that's
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
who when I wanted to see um a report
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
I called the number on the website and
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's where it went and she sent me the
 
00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
report so how can you say you're not
 
00:46:22.859 --> 00:46:24.050 align:start position:0%
report so how can you say you're not
involved

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
because her her role her role in there I
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't supervise her in that role quite
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
literally I do not supervise her as the
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
chair of the the council she handles it
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
as as she sees the best interest and
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
she's confirmed by the executive Council
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
and has been I think twice
 
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:45.530 align:start position:0%
and has been I think twice
so

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
all right this sounds like we might need
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
a different work session on the deeper
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
dive that and maybe invite some of those
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
folks to see if they'll join us I
 
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative Ames do you want to add
 
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:55.970 align:start position:0%
representative Ames do you want to add
anything

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
just just a few words because I do agree
 
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
that this is really a separate
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
discussion that we need to pursue
 
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.309 align:start position:0%
discussion that we need to pursue
um

00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I absolutely support funding for
 
00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:10.569 align:start position:0%
and I absolutely support funding for
um

00:47:10.569 --> 00:47:10.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:13.940 align:start position:0%
the prevention and
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
and help directed towards those who
 
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:21.260 align:start position:0%
might or do engage in problem gambling
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
and I also want to commend the director
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
of the lottery for supporting that as
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
well throughout his career and I know
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
that from the time when I chaired the
 
00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:35.109 align:start position:0%
that from the time when I chaired the
gaming

00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gaming commission back in
 
00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.370 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gaming commission back in
maybe

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:39.380 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.589 align:start position:0%
maybe
2013

00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:41.599 align:start position:0%
2013
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
and not only you but Ed Talbot who is
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
the person that has been mentioned
 
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
indirectly but not by name
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
who himself is a recovered or recovering
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the right lingo is but
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
a man who experienced serious problem uh
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
gambling and its effects and who has
 
00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
persevered through all of this time
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
working on this issue and finding tow
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
hos here and there to keep going and I
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
know he was very helpful to to me when I
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
did my work at that time so
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
um yes uh we need the funding that's one
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
issue we need to be sure the funding is
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
properly used and that's another issue
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I think it would help all of us
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
because problem gambling keeps popping
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
up as we deal as the sole Committee in
 
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:42.740 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:48:45.849 --> 00:48:45.859 align:start position:0%
responsible for gambling with
 
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
this question of problem gambling and it
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
keeps cropping up in the statutes as
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative Alma has noted with
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
different language I noticed that in
 
00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
this bill uh it's it's money for problem
 
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
gambling which is a strange way of
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
putting it and then in representative
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
omni's language is for the
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
identification treatment of problem
 
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.690 align:start position:0%
identification treatment of problem
gambling

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:13.700 align:start position:0%
gambling
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
and if I were writing it I would have
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
added prevention
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
as another funded activity
 
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
but it's something we need to focus on I
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
guess it's what I'm I'm pointing to
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
um if we pull back to this bill that's
 
00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
um and the question of allocating
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
breakage to it
 
00:49:36.839 --> 00:49:37.849 align:start position:0%
breakage to it
um

00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think we could go forward although I'm
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
now pausing because of this question of
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
is it too much money or too little and
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better to just do it by
 
00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:50.099 align:start position:0%
appropriation which is where it's landed
 
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.099 align:start position:0%
right now it goes through the House Bill
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
one appropriation process House Bill 1n2
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's where judgments are
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
made about how much money is needed and
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
how much has been spent that's part part
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
of the budgeting process and uh it would
 
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
be an expense item and part of the
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
review would be whether it's
 
00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
sufficiently independent of the lottery
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
so maybe it's in just the right place
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can discuss this uh we
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
don't need a separate allocation of the
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
breakage but I kind of like seeing that
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
happen and
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm just not sure about that
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
so uh I don't know where that leads us
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
but that's sort of a
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh expressing my thoughts on an issue
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
that's evolving as we sit here
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
so I can make two points manager I know
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of the house I wanted to
 
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
make two points which I thought would be
 
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
relevant um first I think I originally
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
gave the council the idea for a
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund because when I was a
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
Damascus when I was Mass lottery I was a
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
general counsel there and I wrote the
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
language that's permanently funded them
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
because their budget had been cut to
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
zero and so they got a specific an
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
account from the Mass lottery revenues
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
that was dedicated for life and was not
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
lapsing so the I think the idea came
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
from us but me personally so I apologize
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
um second
 
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
um when the council was originally
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
funded back with Keno revenues at the
 
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
time our revenues from all gambling was
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
around 70 million this year to be 180.
 
00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:29.900 align:start position:0%
so if you if the problem was X in
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
2015-16 it's probably more than that now
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest the funding it
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there's a lot more to
 
00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:47.099 align:start position:0%
discuss on the the fund itself how it's
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
structured and so forth
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
um should we maybe go back to talking
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
about the breakage definition do we have
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
any experts here including the director
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
yeah on the breakage definition so as I
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
as I was leaving the room I realized
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
what the question was representative
 
00:52:05.690 --> 00:52:05.700 align:start position:0%
fellows had and and the answer so and I
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
apologize for as usual Murphy's Law
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
having it too late so all horse racing
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
is based on a two dollar wager
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
you go if you go to a tote board you
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
know the board's a two dollar wager and
 
00:52:18.049 --> 00:52:18.059 align:start position:0%
so what you get paid off of that is on
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
the board so if the horse that you bet
 
00:52:23.809 --> 00:52:23.819 align:start position:0%
on say wins 340 you win your bet on a
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
two dollar bet times 340. so if you bet
 
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
ten dollars you win thirty four dollars
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
and the breakage would have come off of
 
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
that through as I understand it the
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
breakage would have come off at 3.40
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
well multiplied 10 times so you don't
 
00:52:36.839 --> 00:52:38.630 align:start position:0%
well multiplied 10 times so you don't
get

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:44.210 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
um representative did you have a
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah you do your math just
 
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
escaped you said it was a two dollar bet
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
correct so representative fellows used
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
the analogy of a ten dollar bet or ten
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
times Ben yeah okay
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
um but so it's really five times the
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
three dollars and forty cents or ten
 
00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:03.140 align:start position:0%
times the 3.40
 
00:53:05.809 --> 00:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
bubbled it for a five times the 340
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
right correct it's five times you would
 
00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.210 align:start position:0%
right correct it's five times you would
win

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
win
 
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
17 or seven no yeah 17 but you did a
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
break would you come off of the three
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
dollars and forty cents if say the
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
actual winning amount was 3.41 you would
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
get five pennies would go to breakage
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
and 340 would go to winning says I
 
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
I see some hands up representative ulery
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
so you're telling us that this is the
 
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:34.140 align:start position:0%
only industry where breakage is
 
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.770 align:start position:0%
only industry where breakage is
profitable

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
I I don't know that I don't know that to
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
there's a hole underneath my chair on
 
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
the floor I would just give you the
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
money back with my salary if I don't
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
have to define a breakage again but
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I just want to
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
say that Rick Newman explained it to me
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know since since we met the last
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
time in right
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
and and he went step by step and I
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
understood it completely but it it needs
 
00:54:07.329 --> 00:54:07.339 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
for me to grasp it it needed to slow
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
down a little and go step by step so we
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
might want to consider that yeah if
 
00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
someone could maybe I don't know draw it
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
out on a diagram or something so we can
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
understand how this actually match
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent excellent suggestion
 
00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:23.660 align:start position:0%
I will I will send you a page definition
 
00:54:25.849 --> 00:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
by the close of the business this week
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
explaining breakage and how it works
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
both for
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
I know this sounds odd but horse racing
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
which is easier than a store course
 
00:54:34.849 --> 00:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
racing which is a slightly more
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
complicated believe it or not but you'll
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
get a definition
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
and if there are any of the vendors that
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
do the historic horse racing can give us
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
any help on this too that would be
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
helpful because we're dealing with two
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
different correct and also it's going to
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
vary by vendor quite literally it's
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
going to vary by vendor so that's why
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find what works for
 
00:54:53.579 --> 00:54:56.210 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find what works for
everyone

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh other hands over here on this side
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent a divorce thank you madam
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
so if I understood what you said whether
 
00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
it's a two dollar wager or a 10 wager if
 
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:10.220 align:start position:0%
someone wins
 
00:55:14.809 --> 00:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
3.43 three cents is the breakage if it
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
was a two dollar bet that means the
 
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
breakage gets six cents if it's a ten
 
00:55:22.849 --> 00:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
dollar bet the breakage gets 30 cents
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
nope okay multiplied by five because it
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
would be based off of two dollars so
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
it'd be a three to four a three dollars
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
and forty Cent wager
 
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
would be the amount you would win off of
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
two dollars so you would I don't get
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
into odds making but it would be say
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
3.43 cents three cents would be breakage
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
I got the three cents right so how much
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
actually goes to breakage if it's a ten
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
dollar bet it would be 15 cents 15 cents
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
because it's five two dollar bets five
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's five shares of the wind pool
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
okay I I got that but I don't know if I
 
00:55:58.790 --> 00:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
could explain it back thank you what's
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
up Prince Right
 
00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:12.140 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair uh
 
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
when some of us learn different ways
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
so when you send out your explanation
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
sheet if you could try to send give us
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
information in different ways such as
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
percentages as well as examples it would
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
certainly be helpful to me thank you
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
representative oh me
 
00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank you is it possible to do that for
 
00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
horse racing and for the machines
 
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.210 align:start position:0%
horse racing and for the machines
on

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:52.700 align:start position:0%
with and without the change of language
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
from based on each dollar to of each
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
wage I believe so I certainly will give
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
it an effort yes thank you
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay great we've got another few minutes
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:57:06.049 --> 00:57:06.059 align:start position:0%
spilsbury yeah this is a very minor
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
suggestion I wouldn't file an amendment
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
to do it but if we're rewriting this
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh online page uh one of the bill line
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
18 where it says multiple of 10
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
. I got the impression that this was
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
confusing and just adding the word sense
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
multiple of 10 of what it's the multiple
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
of 10 of the odd cents
 
00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
so just putting the word sent in in each
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
of the four places that it occurs I
 
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
think would
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
I apologize you're looking at the bill
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes whether it's the bill or the
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
amendment because I didn't see okay got
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
it thank you so so it in each of these
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
four passages that are amended
 
00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
phrase to the next lowest multiple of 10
 
00:58:10.089 --> 00:58:10.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
Mr McIntyre does that help or hurt do
 
00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
you think
 
00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I don't have the I don't
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
have the amendment in front of me not
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm sorry representative Madam
 
00:58:18.839 --> 00:58:20.510 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm sorry representative Madam
chair

00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.970 align:start position:0%
chair
if

00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
with that yeah yeah I only see it in the
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
bill I don't see it in the amendment so
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
when you get a minute we have more time
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
oh it is an amendment I couldn't find it
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's just maybe a different line the
 
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:50.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative leapley
 
00:58:59.210 --> 00:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
my question doesn't have to do with
 
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:01.940 align:start position:0%
breakage so
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
Mr McIntyre has a response first and
 
00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so do you what do you think
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
about adding the word sense to the Align
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
20 of the amendment does that make any
 
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
sense do you want to think about it
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
don't think about it please I just saw
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
it I and I don't yeah I just you know
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
this is really technical in terms of how
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
this is actually going to impact because
 
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
one of the difficulties is how
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
the it's the how the simulcast the
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
tracks Define breakage matters how it
 
00:59:34.809 --> 00:59:34.819 align:start position:0%
comes in as well as how the
 
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of the machine Define
 
00:59:38.569 --> 00:59:38.579 align:start position:0%
breakage so I don't want to overly limit
 
00:59:40.849 --> 00:59:40.859 align:start position:0%
that and have to have them change
 
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
programming based off of it so you've
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
got hundreds of machines in the field
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
now all of which are programmed and
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
tested which is a very expensive process
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
each one has been to run through a lab
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to speak you know shoot
 
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
from the hip as it were about changing
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
how they would do programming and then
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
you'd have to pull several hundred
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
machines potentially off the field
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
retest them based off of new
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
requirements that's all
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
you understand the issue Madam chair I
 
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940 align:start position:0%
believe I'm sure
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
representative you might want to
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
consider if you have to put in the two
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
dollars there because it's a wager of
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
that's computed on a wager of two
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
dollars correct that's traditional horse
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
racing I would have to confirm with the
 
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
manufacturers as to what's their
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
wagering basis is or what breakage is
 
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
defined by them
 
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
oh okay can I assume or maybe I
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't assume anything anymore
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
um if if when you go to the racetrack
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
and when you're doing simulcast would it
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
be any different
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
um how would it be different I'd have to
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
check I have to check please
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay so staying with the breakage
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
concept other questions on breakage
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative ullery
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
just to follow up in the shipping
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
industry breakage and spoilage have
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
entirely different meaning than they do
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
here and that's what I was referring oh
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
okay oh oh certainly it does so in the
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
liquor business too so
 
01:01:12.559 --> 01:01:14.450 align:start position:0%
liquor business too so
okay

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to reaffirm that I
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
think this is a really important issue
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
and that we need to make sure that it's
 
01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.930 align:start position:0%
and that we need to make sure that it's
funded

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
um generously and in a way that will
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
grow as gambling in the state grows
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure lots of people here have
 
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
their own experience with this issue I
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
was a victim my family was a victim of
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
some of a gambler who like devastated
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
our finances and
 
01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:49.609 align:start position:0%
our finances and
um

01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
his own life and the life of many people
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
around him and just in trying to
 
01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
understand this issue listening to some
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
of the webinars looking around online it
 
01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:04.140 align:start position:0%
sounds like we don't have a great handle
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
on who is gambling on the state in the
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
state how many gamblers there are
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
um but just if I were to put together
 
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
some numbers that I've heard and and
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
maybe you can correct me if you have
 
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
better information but one of the
 
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
better information but one of the
um

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
webinars I was looking at last night
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
said that there were probably 65 000
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
gamblers in the state and
 
01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:32.099 align:start position:0%
um certainly I have all those numbers in
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
my head as well as in data form various
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
ways okay you'd have to Define Gambler
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
right so sort of what they do and I
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
could give you the number as to how many
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
do it right so where I was going with
 
01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
this and and I welcome you to to jump in
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
but I was starting to put together okay
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
if two percent of gamblers are problem
 
01:02:53.089 --> 01:02:53.099 align:start position:0%
gamblers and there are 65 000 gamblers
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
in the state that's 13 000 people who
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
would have a problem with gambling
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 
01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
that'll be 150th to 100. thirteen
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thank you I I that's I know a
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
lot of you have a math background so
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:10.079 --> 01:03:10.670 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
so that's like 190
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
um per person if we're talking about 250
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
000 in an account right so I think it's
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy that we're spending
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
some real time thinking about this issue
 
01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
um because as I looked around and
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
thought about what we were doing it it
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
almost appeared like what we're doing is
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
obviously the state advertises gambling
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
a lot right we're telling people they
 
01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
should go gamble we're encouraging them
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
to go gamble we're spending money
 
01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to gamble in the
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
state so I just want to be cognizant of
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
of that and
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
on the other hand like you said we're
 
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
also want to support people who have a
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
problem and it kind of seems like the
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
way we're supporting them right now is
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
really just I mean if we're talking
 
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
about a budget of 250 000 it's going to
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
be communication right it's going to be
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
a billboard that says hey call this
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
phone number hey call these people it's
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
not going to be actually paying for
 
01:04:13.370 --> 01:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
mental health services for folks right
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I picked up as I was
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
reviewing this information last night is
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
76 percent generally not in New
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of people who have a gambling
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
problem also have a problem with drugs
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
or alcohol so it seems like it's a
 
01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:32.299 align:start position:0%
pretty sophisticated Mental Health
 
01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
Nexus of events
 
01:04:38.329 --> 01:04:38.339 align:start position:0%
um that is going to require some sort of
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
support Beyond you know a fraction we're
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
gonna if we're going to spend a fraction
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
telling people
 
01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
here's the hotline to call Gamblers
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
Anonymous we're going to spend one
 
01:04:50.329 --> 01:04:50.339 align:start position:0%
percent of a budget doing that and you
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
know a million dollars
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
times I don't know what amount telling
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
people to go gamble
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem very well thought out
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad that we're we're gonna stop
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
and think about how much money are we
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
dedicating to this and where's that
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
money going is it just going to make a
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
flyer to tell people like they can call
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
someone but there's actually no
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
support there and it does sound like
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
there are some real experts
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
um in the psych psychological field who
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
are doing research in this area who
 
01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.309 align:start position:0%
are doing research in this area who
understand

01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
um this Nexus so it does sound like we
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
can consult with people and find out how
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
to do this well so I just wanted to
 
01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.329 align:start position:0%
to do this well so I just wanted to
support

01:05:31.329 --> 01:05:31.339 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative Ames comments that this
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
is is a really important issue and I'm
 
01:05:38.329 --> 01:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
really glad we're spending time on it
 
01:05:40.250 --> 01:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I hope that we will fund it
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
adequately and set it up so that it is
 
01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:47.579 align:start position:0%
successful and overseen adequately so
 
01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for dedicating the time to
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
this this morning
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely and representative Malloy
 
01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
I wanted to
 
01:05:58.079 --> 01:05:59.230 align:start position:0%
I wanted to
address

01:05:59.230 --> 01:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative Leafly just said I think
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
we were watching the same
 
01:06:04.859 --> 01:06:06.289 align:start position:0%
we were watching the same
video

01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
video
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
and I wrote down from that 65
 
01:06:13.069 --> 01:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
000 were problem
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
gamblers that's what that I thought that
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
video said an 8 000 were pathological
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
did I hear that wrong or was that
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
uh okay I just wanted to put that out
 
01:06:27.299 --> 01:06:29.029 align:start position:0%
uh okay I just wanted to put that out
there

01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
that seems strange but I don't know I
 
01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:33.299 align:start position:0%
don't know where you got that do you
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
know where who put that up
 
01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
that that video was uh
 
01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:40.490 align:start position:0%
that that video was uh
sent

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
sent
 
01:06:44.089 --> 01:06:44.099 align:start position:0%
I I got that from uh representative Ames
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that was Mr Talbot that was uh uh Mr
 
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
Talbot who was okay I don't believe I
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
saw that email so thank you okay other
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
hands up yes representative Schaumburg
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh uh just going
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
back to representative almi's Amendment
 
01:07:03.529 --> 01:07:03.539 align:start position:0%
there is no problem with anyone here
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
about the words to be deposited changing
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
it from used as payment is there any
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
problem with those words by anybody here
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't matter it's all three uh
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
line six unrepresentative almi's
 
01:07:23.089 --> 01:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
Amendment line 20 it changes the line 30
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure we're just
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
going to be going to one other area when
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
we do go to the study the word to be
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
deposited is what representative almie
 
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
has said instead of and used as a
 
01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:36.710 align:start position:0%
has said instead of and used as a
payment

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
on all all the lines
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
I just I'm just asking a question here
 
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.289 align:start position:0%
I just I'm just asking a question here
does

01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
does anybody have an objection to what
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
she has written to be deposited versus
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
used as payment
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.450 --> 01:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Southworth
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
which one seems clearer to you the
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
change made by a representative of Ami
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
the deposited yeah deposited just as
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
much more specific okay gotcha and
 
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative ulery I see a light yeah
 
01:08:11.809 --> 01:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
two things not to follow up on this
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
immediately when you putting it into the
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
fund is established by 284-22c that is
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
what it the payment comes from so you're
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's fine you're absolutely correct I
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
previously this breakage fund went as a
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
kind of an incentive to the game
 
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
operator is that correct sir
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
it was split three ways it was split uh
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
the operator us and State Treasury
 
01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.709 align:start position:0%
the operator us and State Treasury
okay

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
what if follow-up manager
 
01:08:48.769 --> 01:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
what would be the effect on the stimulus
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
or the incentive but
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
incentivization of the uh game operator
 
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
would it have a deleterious effect on
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
operating these games or or how's that
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
I mean they would lose the revenues
 
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
simple as that in some states I think
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
breakage is 100 of the operator uh and
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
so it would be Revenue that would be
 
01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
lost by the specific entity
 
01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
um which was just Seabrook the star
 
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
course rating operators
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
have already had this baked in with them
 
01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
in terms of breakage
 
01:09:22.739 --> 01:09:23.450 align:start position:0%
in terms of breakage
um

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
I don't think they'd be a bit of post
 
01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
but I'll check with them follow them up
 
01:09:27.179 --> 01:09:28.849 align:start position:0%
but I'll check with them follow them up
again

01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
so if we were to eliminate the incentive
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
we uh would disincentivize offering this
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
game to other individuals which then in
 
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
turn would reduce the amount of funds
 
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
going into the problem gaming uh
 
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
category I mean yes it's less profitable
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
okay representatively thank you madam
 
01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
chair I just wanted to share the the
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
video that was referenced
 
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
um is available on YouTube it's New
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council for responsible gaming
 
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
put it up and it's a conversation about
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
problem gaming prevention and treatment
 
01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with members of the New
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council on problem gaming
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
which is the other one and the New
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council for responsible gaming
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
so both of them together participated in
 
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.770 align:start position:0%
so both of them together participated in
video

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:21.780 align:start position:0%
video
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
I turn it on and it turns off
 
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.110 align:start position:0%
I turn it on and it turns off
on

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
when we were dealing with the idea of a
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
major Casino we went into a lot of the
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
statistics and one of the things that
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
um we found out on was that the
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
addiction rate could rise near a major
 
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
Casino the people who lived near there
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
and could go daily to eight percent of
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
the gamblers so that may be where that
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
eight number came from
 
01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.189 align:start position:0%
eight number came from
but

01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:11:07.199 --> 01:11:09.470 align:start position:0%
but
what

01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
this would be doing
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
at this point would would simply be
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
taking all of that money and specifying
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
that there is a dedicated fund on
 
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
I called it the problem gaming fund just
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
out of something in my head from the
 
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
past I have no no I no no concern with
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
what it's actually called
 
01:11:40.679 --> 01:11:41.950 align:start position:0%
what it's actually called
um

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
but on it it would not be changing
 
01:11:49.130 --> 01:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
anything else in this the thing that is
 
01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
changing stuff is if we fool around with
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
senator elberger
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
um firstly just to respond to
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg's question I
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
agree I like the language the way it's
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's presented now that very clear
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
funneling I'm not sure if you're asking
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
for that information but
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
um and to follow up on representative
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
leapley's comment about
 
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.810 align:start position:0%
leapley's comment about
um

01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
problem risky risky behavior in one of
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
my earlier lives I was I ran alcohol and
 
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.390 align:start position:0%
my earlier lives I was I ran alcohol and
later

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
drug abuse programs which were
 
01:12:37.010 --> 01:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
at that time considered totally
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
different most of us know they're not
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
but it's clear that risky behaviors that
 
01:12:48.169 --> 01:12:48.179 align:start position:0%
include gambling that include substance
 
01:12:48.179 --> 01:12:51.430 align:start position:0%
include gambling that include substance
misuse

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
smoking unprotected sex with multiple
 
01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:56.330 align:start position:0%
smoking unprotected sex with multiple
partners

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
partners
 
01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
partners
um

01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
driving ridiculously fast in bad places
 
01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
to do that tend to
 
01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
be connected uh
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
and it might be worth not instead of
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
this but at some point to consider
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
trying to set up some kind of
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
commission or organization to address
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
the whole notion of risky Behavior
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
when I was working in the field the it
 
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
was clear that the gateway drug which
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
many people thought was marijuana was
 
01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
not but in fact was tobacco
 
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh and it was the the most simple
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
predictor of further substance misuse so
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
all of those things are connected
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not sure who had the
 
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
hand up first representative fellows I
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
apologize I was taking notes
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
I thank you ma'am cheer I I just have
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
one idea and then I have two technical
 
01:13:57.890 --> 01:13:57.900 align:start position:0%
questions so my idea is that in terms of
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
how we split the breakage when once we
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
figure out how much that is that it
 
01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:05.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be the same for a track
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
or simulcast or the HHS machines just
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
not to discuss now but just the idea
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
that it could be doesn't have to be the
 
01:14:17.649 --> 01:14:17.659 align:start position:0%
same for all of them and my questions
 
01:14:22.689 --> 01:14:22.699 align:start position:0%
had to do with I I saw I saw an ad on TV
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
and it was for sports betting and they
 
01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
were talking about the Kentucky Derby so
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
can you tell me is it is can you know I
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
was thinking that horse racing would be
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
under these laws but I saw something on
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
the ad on TV uh so uh think of the
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
question the we don't currently accept
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
horse racing Wagers through our sports
 
01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
there'd have to be some kind of Statute
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
change to do that so there's another
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
bill pending before you called Advanced
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
deposit wagering which
 
01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
sort of corrects So currently the status
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
is there are operators taking wagering
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
on horse racing over mobile and internet
 
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
that we do not regulate they're doing it
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
currently there are a few operators that
 
01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:19.620 align:start position:0%
do that I don't believe they advertise
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
on TV but I do know that they will send
 
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
emails and they'll like we don't
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
regulate them currently there's a bill
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
um before you to to bring them under the
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
fold and legalize the activity
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you when you say operators
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
you mean vendors vendors yeah so yeah
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
there's um Churchill Downs was one
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
they've ceased operations uh or
 
01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.470 align:start position:0%
they've ceased operations uh or
postponed

01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
postponed
 
01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
um there's one called TVG uh that does
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
it as well it's a it's a small niche
 
01:15:49.970 --> 01:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
market currently they operate under a
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
gray area
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
um under a federal law called the
 
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
interstate horse racing Act of 1978
 
01:15:57.950 --> 01:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
which they allege makes them legal we
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
don't believe it does rag said it's gray
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
why don't you fix it in the Statue so
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
that's why the law is put let's keep
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
going around the room and the other
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
question I had is in terms of where the
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
money goes for the problem gambling it
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
goes to that the council for a
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
responsible gambling so is that in
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
statute or is that in rules where where
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's in the sports betting rules
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
statute statute yeah it's in the sports
 
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
building yeah yeah Statue yeah sorry
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's been so many times that has been
 
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
referenced in so many bills that have
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
passed this body I I lose track but yes
 
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay other hands up on this side of the
 
01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:43.739 align:start position:0%
room representative Ames yep
 
01:16:43.739 --> 01:16:45.830 align:start position:0%
room representative Ames yep
time

01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make this point that uh
 
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about the issue of
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
problem gaming some some
 
01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh numbers have been mentioned about the
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
number of gamblers out there uh and then
 
01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
the incidents of responsible gaming I
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
just want to caution everyone
 
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of research there's a
 
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
lot of data that is available I I I
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want us to be walking away from
 
01:17:21.410 --> 01:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
here thinking that there are 165 000
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
problem gamblers in New Hampshire I'm
 
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
not sure that's right I see director
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
McIntyre agreeing with me so maybe you
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
could uh speak on that well certainly so
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
um if there are a million adults giving
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
round numbers of the state about a
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
million adults we sold about half a
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
million of them a Powerball ticket last
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
year or two or three or more so that's
 
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
the largest product we have in terms of
 
01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:46.729 align:start position:0%
the largest product we have in terms of
breath

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:46.739 align:start position:0%
breath
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
but it's very
 
01:17:50.810 --> 01:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
because of the Velocity because the
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
drawings only every other third day
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
you can't play as often so problem
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
gamblers don't really go to Powerball
 
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
so the universe of problem gamblers who
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
do Powerball is very very low because it
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen very often whereas sports
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
betting is a very small Market
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
meaning we only have
 
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand registered
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
users at any given month we only have
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 50 000 people who access
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
the platform and that includes folks
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
about a state so you're talking in-state
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
problems if it's two percent sports
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
betting might be a higher because it's
 
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
velocity because you can play more often
 
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
there's always sporting events on and so
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
you have to sort of when you define
 
01:18:33.229 --> 01:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
Gambler it's the Powerball player to a
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
sports bet or you know velocities which
 
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
I I've read literature which is a very
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
how accessible it is and also how often
 
01:18:43.729 --> 01:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
you can play meaning can you play
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
immediately or could you have to wait
 
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
three days
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
will help Define if it's a problem or
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
not for the person because or create the
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
problem so I'd say the numbers probably
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
close to Fifteen twenty thousand people
 
01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
maybe 15 000 would have maybe an issue
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
and based on the calls we get the
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
council gets it gets maybe a dozen two
 
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
dozen three dozen calls a month
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
but also for example we have the
 
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
DraftKings platform and our Lottery
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
platform have
 
01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:15.350 align:start position:0%
platform have
um

01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
functions that you can call in and say I
 
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
want to exclude myself because I have a
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
problem or whatever and those have
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of people
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
and I think the DraftKings platform
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
exceeds the thousand people now exclude
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
themselves we'll voluntary exclude
 
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:30.420 align:start position:0%
themselves and there are rare instances
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
but it does happen where a person will
 
01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
have will use the call center
 
01:19:37.850 --> 01:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
and use language which we believe is a
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
problem meaning I need to win this month
 
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
because of my mortgage payment and then
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
we will cancel their account
 
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
something like it hasn't happened often
 
01:19:46.729 --> 01:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
but it happens and we will disable the
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
account for that problem so I would say
 
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
15 000 is probably a number you could
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative almond
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
there have been for a long time we used
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
to be just scratch tickets
 
01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
and there are people on there was one I
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
was told about by my convenience store
 
01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
operator when I was getting my paper
 
01:20:17.699 --> 01:20:18.649 align:start position:0%
operator when I was getting my paper
there

01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
many years ago who we we are across from
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
a ball bearing plant and every payday he
 
01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
would come in and buy
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
80 scratch tickets
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
stand there and open them until he'd run
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
out and then he'd go home with less
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
money to his wife
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:20:46.199 --> 01:20:49.010 align:start position:0%
so that's
um

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
scratch so scratch tickets is something
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
that most people a lot of people in the
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
state do but a lot of people are only
 
01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.070 align:start position:0%
state do but a lot of people are only
doing

01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
one for Christmas or
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
five for for a Christmas present or
 
01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
something like that so
 
01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.130 align:start position:0%
something like that so
um

01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
but it's really very difficult to
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
identify and and what we heard when we
 
01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:20.940 align:start position:0%
were doing the casino work was that it's
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
um that a lot of gamblers that have a
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
major problem do and I think
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative leapley knows do not want
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
anybody to know
 
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
and are not willing to go and get help
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
because they're going to fix everything
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
okay we have now spent quite a bit of
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
time on this
 
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I think the consensus correct me if
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong is that um no matter what this
 
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
bill needs more work right on the we
 
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
have two issues we have the breakage
 
01:21:59.209 --> 01:21:59.219 align:start position:0%
definition and then we have
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
how do we handle the money and make sure
 
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
the money is going for proper uses
 
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:05.990 align:start position:0%
the money is going for proper uses
effectively

01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
um so we are not going to exec this
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
today we have much more time to work on
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
this this is not an early build so we
 
01:22:15.169 --> 01:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more time so we can
 
01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
consider uh if you want to move your
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment later or if other people have
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
amendments so we have a little bit more
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
time or maybe the right thing to do as a
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
separate bill for some of these issues
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative only
 
01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:32.219 align:start position:0%
I think it would be really important to
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
do this as a separate well conceived
 
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
bill but I think it would also be
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
helpful if we could get the woman that
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
is in charge
 
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.070 align:start position:0%
is in charge
of

01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
of this to come talk to us
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
since you really shouldn't be talking
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
about it correct I'll happily pass along
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
the message and I'll have her uh Madam
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
chair if it's okay I'll help her contact
 
01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.250 align:start position:0%
chair if it's okay I'll help her contact
you

01:22:55.250 --> 01:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
um and that'll be the extent of my uh
 
01:22:59.330 --> 01:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
but I will certainly pass along the
 
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
information in fact excellent we can we
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
can discuss whether that would be
 
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
um a work session on this bill or if
 
01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's something we wanted to do
 
01:23:10.610 --> 01:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
um separately I just have to think
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
through that the proper format to do
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
that but we will and it sounds like
 
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of interest in doing a
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
separate bill for next term
 
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
um so we'll continue to explore all
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
those options another hand was being
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
raised over there and there's your thing
 
01:23:25.970 --> 01:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth I see it I see
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
it now
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
I apologize it is hard to see sometimes
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
in the corners
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
ah thank you
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
um just following up on your figure
 
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
which I appreciate of around 15
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
000 and following up on other comments
 
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
there's similar patterns with all the
 
01:23:43.490 --> 01:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
different kind of addictions my sense
 
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
would be then you'd have a much smaller
 
01:23:47.930 --> 01:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
number which might even be two or three
 
01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
thousand but those are the much more
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
severe people who actually need much
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
more Intervention which is going to take
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
a chunk of the funds yeah it's a
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
difficult number to assess only because
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's also needs and um sort of
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
means based like I have a gentleman who
 
01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
wages sports betting very large figures
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
very large but he owns a Gulf Stream
 
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
and so for him this is what he does for
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
fun and it's figures that would Astound
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
you but it's not a problem for him
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
because it's his he loves to do it and
 
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
he he can easily afford it so
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
um but yeah it's right if there's a
 
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
smaller percentage It's a larger problem
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
other comments okay
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
um I guess we can close this and I
 
01:24:31.729 --> 01:24:31.739 align:start position:0%
should mention that I'm involved in this
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
industry I wouldn't I'm not sure how
 
01:24:34.729 --> 01:24:34.739 align:start position:0%
this would impact me but I am involved
 
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
in this industry
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
um but we will close the work session on
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 112 and continue discussions
 
01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
okay so now we will open up and I forgot
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
I don't have a little gavel
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
we will now open up the public hearing
 
01:24:55.850 --> 01:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 19 and we have a
 
01:24:58.490 --> 01:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment
 
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
number 1475 hopefully in your pile and I
 
01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:03.830 align:start position:0%
number 1475 hopefully in your pile and I
will

01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
hold on hold on let me just see if I can
 
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
find it I left them both though there's
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
two amendments that I put a copy of each
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
and everyone's place
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:33.179 align:start position:0%
okay let me just look see if I can find
 
01:25:33.179 --> 01:25:36.169 align:start position:0%
okay let me just look see if I can find
it

01:25:36.169 --> 01:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay just all right everyone has it
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
okay so that we had heard that there
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
were some interesting amendments on this
 
01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.110 align:start position:0%
were some interesting amendments on this
bill

01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
um we checked with the house clerk
 
01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
um he thought it would be best to do a
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
non-germanian Amendment hearing so that
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
we could make sure we discuss this
 
01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
publicly so representative Platt would
 
01:26:00.649 --> 01:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
you like to go through
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
your amendments yes thank you uh and I
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned this two amendments 1603 as
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
well they both do the same thing but
 
01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:11.340 align:start position:0%
different sections of the law so they
 
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
have to be at two different amendments
 
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
one's essentially 1603 is off of 14.75.
 
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
the Amendments simply allow Lucky Seven
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
to be applied over the same apply
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
allowed over the same 16 days that Bingo
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 19 FM become law the amendment
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
requires a separate hearing since this
 
01:26:37.209 --> 01:26:37.219 align:start position:0%
house clerk ruled that the amendment
 
01:26:39.649 --> 01:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
non-germain he did so because the
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
amendment starts wording an RSA 287 E21
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
was the original Bill concerned RSA 287
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
E6 same chapter in section but a
 
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
different subsection concerning Lucky
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
Seven rather than bingo I owed the
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
adoption of this amendment thank you and
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
going on to 1603 it was pointed out to
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
me by Rick Newman thank you very much
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
that this wording is twice in the
 
01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:08.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
have the whole thing Rewritten and come
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
back to us for approval for the
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
executive rewrite but 1603 is a
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
different section of the same the same
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
wording so it was in there twice where
 
01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
it was Lucky Seven was ten days we have
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
to change it to 16. till it's consistent
 
01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:26.270 align:start position:0%
to change it to 16. till it's consistent
throughout

01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
I actually do have a pink card from Rick
 
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:30.780 align:start position:0%

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:06.350 align:start position:0%
 
1503

01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:16.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%

01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay and then we also have another
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Alma you have
 
01:28:27.649 --> 01:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
an amendment as well so we have three
 
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
amendments so let's talk about them all
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
now and then we'll ask
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
um the person to testify but you want to
 
01:28:42.169 --> 01:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
this came from Senator Susie and it was
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
introduced here by
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
um Cindy Senator Rosenwald and they I
 
01:28:58.850 --> 01:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
through continually asking them I
 
01:29:02.450 --> 01:29:02.460 align:start position:0%
finally got word backs that the Senate
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
on Republicans are fine that senator
 
01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
avard in particular who is this Prime
 
01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:11.940 align:start position:0%

01:29:16.199 --> 01:29:17.090 align:start position:0%
is approves of this amendment also
um

01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
it was a little difficult because he was
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
traveling and Out of Touch
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
and his second was sick
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
is sick so
 
01:29:27.239 --> 01:29:28.129 align:start position:0%
is sick so
um

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
what it does is to just increase the
 
01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
amount of money that the Charities
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
themselves can pay on
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
volunteers that have had to
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
take a long bus ride
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
on buy dinner
 
01:29:48.719 --> 01:29:49.430 align:start position:0%
on buy dinner
um

01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:52.070 align:start position:0%
um
Maybe

01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
Maybe
 
01:29:55.610 --> 01:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
pay for pens to bring for the for the
 
01:29:58.970 --> 01:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
bingo game that kind of thing
 
01:29:58.980 --> 01:29:59.629 align:start position:0%
bingo game that kind of thing
um

01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:30:04.810 --> 01:30:04.820 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:08.219 align:start position:0%
the amount of money is in the bud in the
 
01:30:08.219 --> 01:30:09.070 align:start position:0%
the amount of money is in the bud in the
lead

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
lead
 
01:30:12.649 --> 01:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
law now as not to exceed twenty five
 
01:30:12.659 --> 01:30:13.610 align:start position:0%
law now as not to exceed twenty five
dollars

01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
and 25 was put in quite a long time ago
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
and inflation has eaten into it and we
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
all have heard that they are having
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
trouble getting volunteers for the bingo
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
games they have to run with Volunteers
 
01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
in Bingo and
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
um because of our law
 
01:30:36.290 --> 01:30:36.300 align:start position:0%
and so they wanted to
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
get an increase up to 50 meaning that
 
01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
the charity will get expense
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
statement from the volunteer and agree
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
with all her part of it and then pay
 
01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:53.699 align:start position:0%
them whatever that was it doesn't mean
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
they get fifty dollars it means that
 
01:30:58.729 --> 01:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
they get whatever their expenses that
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
the charity accepts would be
 
01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:06.179 align:start position:0%
so that's all it does but it did seem to
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
me like a useful thing
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
to keep the bingo games going for the
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
people that still like to play Bingo and
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
like to socialize at bingo
 
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
I should just mention though that this
 
01:31:19.370 --> 01:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
we are discussing it because we're
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
discussing this topic and we have
 
01:31:24.169 --> 01:31:24.179 align:start position:0%
experts here but um this technically
 
01:31:26.330 --> 01:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
probably would not be considered germane
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
because it isn't a different section of
 
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
the statute so we may have to actually
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
put that on the calendar for next week
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
when we exec it just to be fully
 
01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
everyone aware of what's going on here
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
um but I thought it's important that we
 
01:31:41.689 --> 01:31:41.699 align:start position:0%
discuss it yeah the clerk has gotten
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
quite rigorous all of a sudden yeah on
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
this particular issue yes as a operation
 
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
of a bingo game it always would have
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
been considered Germaine before but yeah
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
so we'll comply with whatever we need to
 
01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:55.310 align:start position:0%
so we'll comply with whatever we need to
do

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:56.930 align:start position:0%
do
okay

01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
um represent I should mention that I am
 
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
involved in this industry so I am
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
impacted by this bill uh Rick Newman
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
would you be available to come up and
 
01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.310 align:start position:0%
would you be available to come up and
testify

01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
is there and if anyone else would like
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%

and to uh
 
01:32:45.410 --> 01:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
reiterate what he said that these
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
amendments make the statute consistent
 
01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
if you if you pass Senate Bill 19 to
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
allow um
 
01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:56.219 align:start position:0%

month
 
01:32:59.930 --> 01:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
um these two amendments would allow a
 
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
sale of Lucky Seven to go from 10 to 16
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
days as well I think it's just really a
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
technical change
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.129 align:start position:0%
questions we have experts from Lottery
experts

01:33:31.129 --> 01:33:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.139 --> 01:33:32.570 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:35.209 --> 01:33:35.219 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis yeah I'm just
 
01:33:35.219 --> 01:33:36.350 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis yeah I'm just
wondering

01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
um representative putt's Amendment
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
the 1603 has a whole section about the
 
01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:45.830 align:start position:0%
the 1603 has a whole section about the
dispensers

01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
dispensers
 
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
so are the dispensers already covered or
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
oh this is this isn't a
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
I think it's just reiterating existing
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
statute but just showing you the change
 
01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
but it's it says that section
 
01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:06.169 align:start position:0%
but it's it says that section
two

01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
is a new sub paragraph
 
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
post three is not three is never mind
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
yeah sometimes the way these amendments
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
are coming back is a little confusing in
 
01:34:20.689 --> 01:34:20.699 align:start position:0%
my opinion it's the only change is to
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
change 10 days to 16 days in two places
 
01:34:26.209 --> 01:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
for Lucky Seven period all else is doing
 
01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
things a little bit differently this
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
year so it's getting a little caught up
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.199 --> 01:34:36.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
is that it
 
01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
seem no one else signed up yep go ahead
 
01:34:42.179 --> 01:34:45.169 align:start position:0%
seem no one else signed up yep go ahead
representative

01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Plus
 
01:34:49.729 --> 01:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
over here
 
01:34:52.129 --> 01:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
uh would this have to go back to the
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
Senate if it's amended or is it a
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee a conference it would go to
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
anytime we amend something then the
 
01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
Senate can either concur non-concur or
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.689 --> 01:35:10.699 align:start position:0%
other comments questions
 
01:35:13.129 --> 01:35:13.139 align:start position:0%
testimony seeing none we will now close
 
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:16.340 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on Senate Bill 19
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
with Amendment
 
01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.010 align:start position:0%
with Amendment
1475.

01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
1475.
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
Madam chair should I limited to that or
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
did shall we cover 1603 as well I
 
01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:30.500 align:start position:0%
believe 1603 as well because it is
 
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
related to that thank you yes that's
 
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
1606 again we will do it we'll schedule
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
a public hearing on that
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
even for just five minutes just to make
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
sure we catch everyone who has a comment
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
on that uh and then
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully well maybe we'll be able to
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
execute next week we'll see again this
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
is not an early bill so we do have time
 
01:35:59.330 --> 01:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
so you can look this over and see what
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions you have okay so we are now
 
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
I believe done for the day and we will
 
01:36:10.090 --> 01:36:10.100 align:start position:0%
plan to reconvene next Tuesday
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
in the 9 A.M to 1
 
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
kind of range we're going to focus on
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
that to try to get things done and to
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
have be able to have all of you attend
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
next week yes so we're going to hear
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
this non-germaine amendment and then uh
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
unless we need to do any other work
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
sessions we will then go into an exec
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
session and of course each caucus may
 
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
break from time to time to discuss
 
01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
things and where things are going but at
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
a minimum we will be taking out an exec
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
session for Senate bill 120.
 
01:36:51.050 --> 01:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
because that is an early Bill and will
 
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
be absolutely under deadline okay so
 
01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
just be prepared for that
 
01:37:03.850 --> 01:37:03.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
we've got to save the one from school
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
now we're going to think about what
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.890 --> 01:37:23.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
Democrats maybe we could get together
 
01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:27.910 align:start position:0%
Democrats maybe we could get together
briefly

01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
01:37:30.850 --> 01:37:30.860 align:start position:0%
10 minutes
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
can we get together briefly for 10
 
01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:39.129 align:start position:0%
can we get together briefly for 10
minutes

01:37:39.129 --> 01:37:39.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
to connect
 
01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:51.590 align:start position:0%
to connect
exactly

01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
um
