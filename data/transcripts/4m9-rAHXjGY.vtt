good morning madam chair members of the

committee um my name is lindsay courtney
 
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 align:start position:0%

certification
 
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
very important for public safety
 
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
very important for public safety
purposes

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
right now many of our boards currently
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
lack a quorum despite our best efforts
 
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
to find qualified individuals to serve
 
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
and many of these boards have not
 
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
delegated authority for the agency to
 
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
issue licenses
 
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.190 align:start position:0%
issue licenses
and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
i would submit that no board has the
 
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
authority to presently to delegate
 
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
authority to deny licenses
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%
we're also um
 
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
so essentially with with those boards
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
that currently lack a quorum
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
we are issuing licenses by operation of
 
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
law pursuant to rsa 541 a29
 
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
541a29 requires an agency to respond to
 
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
an application within 30 days of
 
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
receiving the application
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
once we receive a response it doesn't
 
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be the response
 
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.910 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to be the response
needed

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
the agency has 60 days to act
 
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
and the agency
 
00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 align:start position:0%
that i'm discussing is is our licensing
 
00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.149 align:start position:0%
that i'm discussing is is our licensing
boards

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
so what happens when the board does not
 
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
convene a quorum to adjudicate the
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
application after 60 days the
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
application is
 
00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
is granted by operation of law without
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
regard to whether or not the individual
 
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
actually meets the requirements for
 
00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
licensure obviously this this poses some
 
00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.589 align:start position:0%
licensure obviously this this poses some
significant

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
safety concerns
 
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an example for about two
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
years the
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
board of hearing care providers which
 
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
has now been merged with speech language
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
pathology did not have a quorum
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
so it was a great time for somebody who
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
was unqualified to apply to become an
 
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.270 align:start position:0%
was unqualified to apply to become an
audiologist

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
audiologist
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
because we were just required to issue
 
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
the licenses
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
even if they did not meet the basic
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
requirements so this bill really just
 
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
clarifies that if the person does not
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements for licensure that
 
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
the agency does have authority to deny
 
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.790 align:start position:0%
the agency does have authority to deny
it

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
i take it that your
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
review of the requirements is things
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
like education and not
 
00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 align:start position:0%
good moral court character or some of
 
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
the less
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
obvious requirements some of the boards
 
00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.310 align:start position:0%
obvious requirements some of the boards
have

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
correct my personal opinion is i i do
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
not like good moral character
 
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
requirements because i think it invites
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
subjectivity and bias into the licensure
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
application process um we obviously
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
would not be able to adjudicate that so
 
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
we would just be looking at whether or
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
not they've met educational
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications our supervised training
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the statutory basic
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
anna pearson
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh to bounce off
 
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.550 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh to bounce off
the

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
our chairman's question here um when you
 
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
the requirements that are not subjective
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
does criminal background
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
fall under that as something you look at
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
so we don't have someone coming in here
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
from another state slipping under the
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
radar who's got a rap sheet
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
taller than you
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
so the problem with criminal background
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
checks is that um unless it's
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
the state can't categorically and i
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
should say criminal history checks the
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
state can't categorically i think it's
 
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
under rsa 332g
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
say if you've been convicted of x you
 
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
don't qualify
 
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.430 align:start position:0%
don't qualify
um

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
that is set forth in statute so there
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be a board that or an entity
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
that has a certain amount of discretion
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
to determine whether or not they meet
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
good moral character requirements
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
unless the board had previously put into
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
place some sort of matrix
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
or standing order permitting us or
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
letting us know
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
who would um be qualified um
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
after having a criminal history check i
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
don't think this bill would also allow
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
us to deny licensure based on past
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
criminal history because it's not clear
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
who would qualify if you have a criminal
 
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.990 align:start position:0%
who would qualify if you have a criminal
history

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay we'll follow up
 
00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the
 
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
specifically what's coming to mind with
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
me is the ability to teach in the state
 
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
has a fairly substantial paragraph on
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
certain criteria that will deny someone
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
the ability to have a teaching license
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
do we not have that
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
in other boards
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
i know you don't deal with teachers but
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
but from the oplc standpoint
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
do we not have
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
does this not found in any of the 54
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
boards it is not found in most of the
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
boards because the boards have the
 
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
discretion to review the criminal
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:07.909 align:start position:0%
background check
so

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so that the only thing that oplc
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
could do is say yes you have given us
 
00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 align:start position:0%
your fingerprints and applied for the
 
00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:16.710 align:start position:0%
your fingerprints and applied for the
check

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
that they can deny the license if you
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
haven't done that
 
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
haven't done that
right

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
right now we're not allowed to deny any
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
licenses so i think this is a step in
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
the right direction um
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
but it certainly it doesn't resolve some
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh this is sort of related and
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
that is um
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
you know do any of the boards or finding
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
the licenses are there
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
other requirements which are
 
00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
discretionary or unclear or the boards
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
normally would need to get involved in
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
making a decision what sort of other
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
requirements like that might there be
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
so it always depends on the board
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
because each board um and it also
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
depends on the statutory framework right
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
so certain
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
practice acts
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
grant to certain licensing boards carp
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
launch authority to come up with all of
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
these additional requirements i think
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
the board of psychology is one of them
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
certain practice acts have specific
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements and they must
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
stay within the balance of those
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
we have strongly encouraged boards to
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate subjective requirements to the
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
extent possible
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
case studies those types of things oral
 
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.469 align:start position:0%
case studies those types of things oral
interviews

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
interviews
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
actually issued an executive order back
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
directing boards to
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
review their processes and eliminate
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
subjective requirements
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
so we strongly encourage that but
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
certain boards still have subjective
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
requirements and obviously i'm not
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
qualified to assess
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh an essay of a psychologist to
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
determine you know
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
whether that person is a great
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
psychologist which is why we might we
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
much prefer exams that are based on
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
objective criteria accordingly so um to
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
answer your question there are
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
subjective requirements that we would
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
not be permitted qualified to review
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
follow up so does that mean that um you
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
know for any of the licenses where there
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
are such subjective requirements you
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do anything with it and you
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
would you know if they met the other
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
objective requirements they would get
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
the license under this is that your
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that's correct okay thank
 
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.710 align:start position:0%
understanding that's correct okay thank
you

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.269 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
hi

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
hi
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
when the licenses have been auto
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
automatically rejected for lack of a
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
board meeting
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
do they at least get their license fee
 
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.150 align:start position:0%
do they at least get their license fee
back

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
no licenses are not rejected for lack of
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
a board meeting they're automatically
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
approved even if the individual doesn't
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
thank you and no we don't return the the
 
00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.870 align:start position:0%
thank you and no we don't return the the
fee

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
fee
 
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
fee
corrected

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
actually if if you're applying for a
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
license and the board
 
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
delays the meeting you
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
you're still on the hook for
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
for the fee although we'll apply for
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
your first for your first license
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative show up
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
lindsay

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
lindsay
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
excuse me miss courtney uh can you give
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
us an idea is this
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
instance that you're referring to where
 
00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
boards couldn't meet
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
an approximate percentage of the boards
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
that this affected was it half was it
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
mostly all or
 
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
it varies i will say there are a handful
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
of boards that currently lack a quorum
 
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.790 align:start position:0%
of boards that currently lack a quorum
um

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
an example of medical technicians they
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
haven't met since february
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
the board of respiratory care
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
practitioners i don't even know when the
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
last time they met
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
so we're just issuing licenses after 60
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
days the problem with that also is that
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
they've got to wait 60 days to get their
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
license and as you can appreciate in
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
covid 60 days is a long time for a
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
respiratory care practitioner to wait
 
00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
for a license but that's you know kind
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
of a separate issue
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
so there are a handful wards that are
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
just not meeting then there are boards
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
that particularly in the healthcare
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
because they are actively working in the
 
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.910 align:start position:0%
because they are actively working in the
profession

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:22.870 align:start position:0%
profession
um

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
that they'll cancel at the last minute
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
and there may be you know like
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
psychology for example had to cancel
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
their december meetings somebody had to
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
wait two months to get a license that
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so they are consistently
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
meeting but there could be
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
there could be times where people fall
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're aware that uh some of
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
the boards that you have proposed to
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
members of this committee to make
 
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.829 align:start position:0%
members of this committee to make
advisory

00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
advisory
and

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sure you're aware i've inserted
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
language in several of them saying
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the board for
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
certain actions
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that language would
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
enable you to consult with say one
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
member of that board to approve such
 
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.829 align:start position:0%
member of that board to approve such
applications

00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
yes so that's what we do with our
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
current advisory boards body art massage
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
reflexology we've established uh
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
criteria that it's it's objective and
 
00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:21.990 align:start position:0%
criteria that it's it's objective and
clear

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
so that staff know what they're looking
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
for and there are any criminal history
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
checks for those professions but to the
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
extent that there are questions we
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
consult we consult with our advisory
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
board members
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
so is this problem the board's not
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
having quorum not meeting is something
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
new maybe related to covid or has this
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
been a long-standing issue
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
um i think i think it's been exacerbated
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
certainly particularly in our health
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
boards we're struggling we've sent out
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
email blasts you know i've i've reached
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
out to stakeholders we're struggling to
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
get people to be able to take time off
 
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
work to come drive to concord and
 
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
work to come drive to concord and
um

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
and so that so we have seen that
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
exacerbated during covet i don't see it
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
really getting any better to be honest
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
with you um
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
given our healthcare workforce shortage
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
right now it's just hard for employers
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
to give employees time off what we're
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
finding is we get a lot of people who
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
have retired
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
who may be interested
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
which is great at the same time
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
depending on how long it's been since
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
they've actively practiced you may not
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
be getting that
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
perspective that you'd like
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
so outside the healthcare area i mean
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
are there other boards where this has
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
been a
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know an issue prior to covet and
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
continues to be
 
00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
continues to be
um

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
yes uh court reporters is another one i
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
think you'll see a bill later they have
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
two members they're currently not
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
meeting um
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
we've offered to meet outside with them
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
they are not meeting but there's only 60
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
people in that profession so
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know that will ever convene a
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
quorum um of that board
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
um the technical boards seem to be doing
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
better as it relates to a quorum they
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
also tend to be a little bit smaller
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
some of our health boards are really
 
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.790 align:start position:0%
some of our health boards are really
large

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
but yeah i would agree that cobain has
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
certainly exacerbated this problem
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
president marcia than goalie
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chairman and thank
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question i'm wondering
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
if these various boards were able to
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
meet during the state of emergency when
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
remote meetings were allowed and would
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
adopting a hybrid model where you could
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
physical meeting placement members could
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
attend remotely would that solve your
 
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.870 align:start position:0%
attend remotely would that solve your
problem

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
um i think it would solve uh problems
 
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.389 align:start position:0%
um i think it would solve uh problems
for

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
for most
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
there are boards that literally lack a
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
core of medical technicians is one
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
um and they only have two members which
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
is not a quorum and we've just received
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
word that the other member
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
plans to resign so for most boards i
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
think that would certainly
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
help um we so most of our all of our
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
boards went remote uh pursuant to the
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency order may 7th we
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
brought them back in
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
and we did
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
we did obviously observe that there were
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
issues with
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.910 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
and

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
i understand the difficulty it's a small
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
state and
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
some folks could have to travel an hour
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
and a half two hours to get to a meeting
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
and a board they
 
00:15:48.639 --> 00:15:49.590 align:start position:0%
and a board they
have

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
been put on
 
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.990 align:start position:0%
been put on
um

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
would it help
 
00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:55.990 align:start position:0%
would it help
to

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory that
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
those that have been put in positions
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
have to attend a certain percentage of
 
00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.110 align:start position:0%
have to attend a certain percentage of
meetings

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
and how about
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
making it a requirement that they meet
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
so many times a year so that we can get
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
this done and if they don't show up for
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
those meetings that they will be
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
replaced and
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing in talking a
 
00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
few members here
 
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.189 align:start position:0%
few members here
maybe

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
i know a lot of places have alternates
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
on boards that could fill in um to make
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
sure they get that quorum
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking of a few things we
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
could do to help out because i think
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
instead of making everything advisory we
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
should try and solve the problem we have
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
of not getting quorums
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
and looking at the best way to get there
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
is what i'm looking for
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that would um
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
i would
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
i would support that i think part of the
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
issue is actually getting people to
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
volunteer their time um that is it we
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
have a number of vacancies i send
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
reports to the governor's office every
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
other week and
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
there we have a ton of vacancies
 
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.189 align:start position:0%
there we have a ton of vacancies
actually

00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
public members are very difficult to
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
come by
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
i think part of the issue right that
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with at the office is that
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
you know i'm an agency head all agency
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
heads have to sign a power of attorney
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
so that if you know something happens or
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
you basically
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the agency the government can still
 
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.949 align:start position:0%
the agency the government can still
function

00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
no no there there is no such uh
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
contingency plan when these boards can't
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
meet for whatever reason and some of it
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
is justifiable um of course
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
so when a board doesn't meet literally
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
that part of government shuts down um
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
what is the state's contingency plan
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
the government the governor doesn't have
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
authority i mean to just go in and
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
license people i suppose the legislature
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
could convene quickly but what we're
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
dealing with right now is a lack of a
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
contingency plan
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
maybe the contingency plan could be
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
alternates i think it would depend on
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not the state feels that
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
that's sufficient
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
my main concern would be that in certain
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
professions we're just struggling to
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
maybe our boards are too large i don't
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
know i don't know i mean when you have
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
to have eight people to convene a quorum
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
that seems
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
seems a little large
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
that seems reasonable representative
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
road and then pearson
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair miss courtney
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
would you be able to give us a list of
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
the boards and how many members are on
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
to make a quorum
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the last date that they met
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
that way we have
 
00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:39.750 align:start position:0%
that way we have
follow-up

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
and what do other small states do
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
yeah licensure varies i will say vermont
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
has moved to an advisory model
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
the majority of their professions are
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
under advisory boards the secretary of
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
state has direct authority to issue
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
licenses there are but each
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
state has taken a different approach
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's about 22 umbrella agencies
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
and then other states
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
larger states
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
have licensing boards
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
some states
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
the umbrella agency there are no boards
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
i think utah is one of them and the
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
state just directly regulates the
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
profession through i think their
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
department of labor so it really varies
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
so might it be possible for you to put
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
together a list of contingencies based
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
on what other states do that would fit
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
our model
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
possible contingency plans correct yep i
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
can do that and last follow-up i'm sorry
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
one more i'm going back to the um
 
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.470 align:start position:0%
one more i'm going back to the um
criminal

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
my final follow-up
 
00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.870 align:start position:0%
my final follow-up
um

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about this um
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
lack of ability to use criminal record
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
so how can we address that because that
 
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.390 align:start position:0%
so how can we address that because that
seems

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
seems
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
an emergency to me
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
so how do we how can we address that
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
what are your recommendations for that
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
i think it depends on the board i think
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
when you look at for example
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
um i believe medical technicians which i
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
think we're the only state to regulate
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
medical technicians but i think i
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
believe we require criminal history
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
check for them
 
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.029 align:start position:0%
check for them
so

00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:26.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know one response would be to just
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
continue to try to find people to serve
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
on the board to review the criminal
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
background checks the other option could
 
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.310 align:start position:0%
background checks the other option could
be

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
explicitly set forth
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
statute although you'd have to look at
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
whether that conflicts with 332g as to
 
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
who would actually qualify and who would
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
not 332g directs us to review a
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
case-by-case analysis because
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
under 332g
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
the right to pursue an occupation is a
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
fundamental right so it doesn't give us
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to just carve out
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
classifications of people who are
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
qualified but
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
assuming the legislature can change
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
three theta to g and wanted to do that
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
you could certainly have
 
00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
you could certainly have
um

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
certain buckets and then the other
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
option is to have a contingency plan so
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
that another regulating body can
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
actually act
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
alexander pearson
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of discussion here
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 minutes in reference to
 
00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:28.470 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 minutes in reference to
boards

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
in their quorum abilities with the
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
actual legislation we're talking about
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
in front of us 1059 do you see any
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
differentiation here between a board's
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
inability to
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
have members
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
to make a quorum versus a board's
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
refusal to meet
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
as far as this legislation goes or the
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
do you read this as being the same
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
irrelevant to the the purpose just the
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
fact is the board is not meeting
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
correct i mean we have some people who
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
refuse to come into the building and
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
then we have some people that for
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
what i would consider to be justifiable
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
reasons just can't come
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then we have some i can't
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
there literally is not a quorum
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter under this bill this
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
bill is really just intended to provide
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
a contingency plan if a board is not
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
meeting that would allow the agency to
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
deny licenses to people who are clearly
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
not meeting the qualifications because
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
we have concerns that we've been
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
essentially handing them out like candy
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman thank you for
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're trying to do
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
here and not so much against it but just
 
00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:42.230 align:start position:0%
here and not so much against it but just
concerned

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
if somebody i know you have trouble with
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
getting people there but what happens
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
when somebody objects to the licensee
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
and what is the procedure
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
can they submit an affidavit or a report
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
they'll be read into the record for the
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
consideration of the others
 
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.390 align:start position:0%
consideration of the others
in

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
in context of how this will work in the
 
00:23:02.559 --> 00:23:05.110 align:start position:0%
in context of how this will work in the
future

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
when you say if somebody objects who it
 
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.510 align:start position:0%
when you say if somebody objects who it
objects

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
objects
 
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.230 align:start position:0%
objects
well

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
you get somebody applying for the
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
license let's say you make somebody is
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with that particular licensee's
 
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.710 align:start position:0%
familiar with that particular licensee's
case

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
and they cannot make the meeting is
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
there a way that they can submit if they
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
cannot make the meeting submit some form
 
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.630 align:start position:0%
cannot make the meeting submit some form
of

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.470 align:start position:0%
of
objection

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
objection
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
so certainly our
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
even when we lack a quorum um and i'll
 
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
give you a true example
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
we had on i think it was
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
land surveyors recently
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
um they missed a meeting or two and
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
there was an applicant who was held up
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
in the 60-day time frame and we
 
00:23:47.039 --> 00:23:47.830 align:start position:0%
in the 60-day time frame and we
they

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
got the license by operation of law or
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
we told the we told members of the board
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
that you know you need to come in or
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to happen
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
concerns from a board member that the
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
person didn't meet the basic
 
00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.510 align:start position:0%
person didn't meet the basic
qualifications

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
under the current structure
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
it didn't matter
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
we had to issue the license because
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
there was no quorum
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
under this structure
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
we could take the feedback and provided
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
that the concerns were they clearly
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't meet this
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
requirement set forth in statute or rule
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
we could deny the license if it was just
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
i know this person i don't think they
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
would have good moral character i i'm
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
not sure that absent a specific
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
authorization by statute that we would
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
a follow-up follow-up uh i i think what
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
i was probably thinking about you're
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
doing the medical and emts in particular
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
and so when they come for re-licensing
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
and everything they do have a history
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
and what happens if one community did
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
have some objection in just following
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
along that line
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a valid point i think it goes
 
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
probably less to licensure and more to
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
disciplinary so the other issue that
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
this doesn't address but the other issue
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
is when boards don't convene a quorum
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
there's nobody to review complaints and
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
we have we do have some boards right now
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
with just complaints out there that um
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
there's nothing we can do about it
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
i have a question assuming that somebody
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
applied for meeting and a board
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
applied for an app a license immediately
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
after one board meeting they're
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
scheduled to meet every month there's a
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
snowstorm in in the month and the 60 day
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
is the day before the
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
the next meeting of the board
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
and so therefore you wish issue the
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
license on day 60 the board meets looks
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
do they have recourse to review the
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
license and say uh wait a minute this
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
person does not meet our qualifications
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
or do they have to go into the
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
disciplinary mode they do because once
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
you have a license you have a
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protected property
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
interest that entitles a person to due
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
process notice and an opportunity to be
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
heard before you take it away
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much other
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.990 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
representative

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so i i can imagine
 
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.149 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so i i can imagine
you're

00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
also thinking in the background
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
something that just has been occurring
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
to me as i listen to the director
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
testify that is those of us who are on
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
the jail car realize that that we also
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
have a problem uh with rules uh which
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes can expire uh the joke the
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
jail car is not
 
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to kind of pocket veto rules if
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
we if we don't act
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
within the specified
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
deadline unless we
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
get a waiver
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
the rule goes into effect
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
and we've had situations that chair i'm
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
sure is aware of it
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
in as much as she's been on the jail car
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
with me for the last 10 years or so uh
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
that we we have situations where rules
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
come in and and uh they get vetted they
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
go back to the board for
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
some kind of amendment because the rules
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
a certain aspect of the rule is uh uh is
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
not acceptable to the jail car
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
and and it sits there because the board
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
is not going to meet again for x number
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
of times so if you have quorum problems
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
then they never get around to it no but
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
i i'm raising this with the chair
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
because is this something where we may
 
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
want to uh amend this bill a little bit
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh to try to expand it
 
00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.269 align:start position:0%
uh to try to expand it
to

00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
to consider some of the
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
schmidt that's a very valuable point but
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
it's more appropriate for an executive
 
00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:52.070 align:start position:0%
it's more appropriate for an executive
session

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
well but uh she is the director of
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
an organization that has a very large
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
number of small boards
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
director carl if you can't understand
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
what the question was
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
represent schmidt if you could put it
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
more concisely
 
00:28:18.149 --> 00:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
would you uh based on your experience
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
with your boards uh would you uh
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
consider that there's some aspect of
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
this bill which you would recommend
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
expanding to facilitate
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
the rule writing aspect along with the
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
other stuff
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
yes i would consider that i think that
 
00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.430 align:start position:0%
yes i would consider that i think that
uh

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
some concerns i would have is that
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
we would receive a lot of objection to
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
it is a valid concern court reporters
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
for example is in the middle of
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
staff were trying to get them to convene
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
a quorum in a parking lot so that they
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
could vote on something and they and
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're not so the rules are just at a
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
standstill and then when they expire you
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
know the agency can't do anything to
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
enforce the rules
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
the proble i think what i think what
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
you're getting at though is there are a
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
lot of issues here uh there's issues
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
with occupational licensing that touches
 
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.990 align:start position:0%
with occupational licensing that touches
upon

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
the structure that we have decided as a
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
state to utilize
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
i the current structure is not working
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you that right now i don't
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
know what the structure should be
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
but i think maybe that should be a
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
larger conversation
 
00:29:27.279 --> 00:29:28.310 align:start position:0%
larger conversation
um

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
i would have concerns attaching it to
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
the bill because i think that the bill
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't move forward
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
and we have a significant issue right
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
now where we're statutorily mandated to
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
issue licenses to individuals who
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
clearly lack qualifications for those
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
licenses and i just i want i would like
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
to get that resolved
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
but i mean i i would certainly support a
 
00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:51.590 align:start position:0%
but i mean i i would certainly support a
larger

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
discussion obviously or as to what we
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
should be doing with occupational
 
00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
should be doing with occupational
licensing

00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
the aspect that we're now discussing is
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
one that occurred to me uh and i
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to sink this bill by
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
making it too too much of a christmas
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
tree but to the degree that we
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
included a study committee that's pretty
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
unobjectionable as in terms of burdening
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt we have a
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
good number of other licensing bills
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
some of which are rather broad and we
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
can consider that issue in the context
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
of those bills i'm glad to hear that
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
since i i was wondering whether we had
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
other vehicles we certainly do okay
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson did you
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
have a question no i just um it's more
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
along the lines of i agree with the
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
director here that let's not jeopardize
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
1059 for the sake of of a broader
 
00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.190 align:start position:0%
1059 for the sake of of a broader
um

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
deep dive that clearly needs to occur
 
00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:50.870 align:start position:0%
deep dive that clearly needs to occur
here

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
testify on house bill 1059
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
representative infantine
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.549 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's an occupational injury no question
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair and committee
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
my name is representative will infantine
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
from hillsboro 13.
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
i am also a member of the new hampshire
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
electricians board
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
and as i signed in
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair whether i'm opposed or in
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
support i wrote not sure
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
next to it
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
just explain a few of the things
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
that were asked by your committee
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
members here
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
just in relation to the electrician's
 
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.350 align:start position:0%
just in relation to the electrician's
board

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
we have always had a full board we've
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
had a full board for 10 or 15 years we
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
did not miss one meeting through covet
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
we met pretty much every month
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
or every other month as needed
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
first via zoom and then
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
one of the first ones probably to come
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
back in person
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
i am a public member i'm not an
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
electrician so i'm
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
have it is very difficult i'm sure
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
for the director because there are
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
different rules
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
for each committee
 
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.909 align:start position:0%
for each committee
we

00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:32:23.919 --> 00:32:25.590 align:start position:0%
we
regarding

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks are
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
discussing it now
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
but we haven't implemented anything
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
we do have a rule that says we cannot
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
look back more than 10 years of a
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
criminal history
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
so they have to fill out their
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
application whether they've ever been
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
convicted of a felony and if they have
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
you know we can't discuss it if it's
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
been more than 10 years
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have utilized that on a few occasions
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
where people
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
were involved with
 
00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
trying to bring young women across
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
high school girls across
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
state lines for
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
nefarious reasons and we denied that
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
based on that so it concerns me when we
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
have a situation where
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
someone is saying well we're not going
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
to look at character i'm sorry i can't
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
agree with that 100 percent now in my
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
two or three years on the board we've
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
had that one case
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
that we felt that was appropriate and
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
again we are trying to look into
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
background checks because the
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
electrician's board currently does not
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
utilize those while others do
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
the comment was made that what is going
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
on right now is not working jesus i
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
don't know if i take offense to that or
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
not it may not be working for certain
 
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
not it may not be working for certain
committees

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
but it is working for others
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
why do we do this why do we have these
 
00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:39.750 align:start position:0%
why do we do this why do we have these
boards

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
other states it's dealt with by the
 
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:43.029 align:start position:0%
other states it's dealt with by the
government

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you know the old new
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire way we have members of our own
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
peers in our own committees
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
people in our industry can better
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on whether we
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
know someone
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
yeah just caught doing something they
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't have been doing or
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
whether they're a bad egg and they're
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
doing something wrong in the industry
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
we have that ability as individuals i'm
 
00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
we have that ability as individuals i'm
concerned

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
by this bill only of the fact of if you
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
have a committee that is not showing up
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
well that's a problem that chairman and
 
00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
that thing that needs to be dealt with
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
but if if the committee if the
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
administration gets so backed up that
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
these things are automatic in 60 days
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
and we're not looking and we're not
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
looking at some of these
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
character type things
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
i just see that pendulum swinging toward
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
more of a government control
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
and less of what we like to have it now
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
or members of our peers
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
without question there are things that
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
go on
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
with 50 or 70 some boards i don't
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
remember the number
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
that are very inconsistent now this
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
isn't the place to do it
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
to rewrite everything
 
00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
everyone's doing the best they can
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
my only concern as a representative you
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
do this long enough
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
we've all
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
approved and voted for bills that the
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
following year we have to come back and
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
say oh we got to change that because we
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
didn't think about that
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
when we were the
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
the negative consequences so i just want
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure in the back of my mind is
 
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.710 align:start position:0%
to make sure in the back of my mind is
this

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
taking too much away from the boards and
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
doing their responsibilities
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
and basically saying okay hey it happens
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
at a certain time and that's the way it
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
goes now
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
this is electrician's board maybe we're
 
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
a little more well organized maybe we're
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
a little more aggressive and
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
agitated and what have you
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
um it does and i can't speak for all the
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
other ones that aren't meeting it is
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
very disturbing to hear
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
that some of these boards are not
 
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.190 align:start position:0%
that some of these boards are not
meeting

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
considering how much time and effort we
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sitting here madam chairman again
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
as i stated i'm not sure
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
whether i agree or not yet because i
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what the consequences could
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
be thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony will you take some
 
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.390 align:start position:0%
your testimony will you take some
questions

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
yes okay russian pearson and then grota
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm certainly not
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
shocked that the electrician's board is
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
actually functioning
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
as it should considering the safety
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
aspects involved
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
but if looking at the specific piece of
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
legislation especially on line three
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is more of a triggering
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
act in the sense that you know in the
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
event a board does not meet so you know
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
this really puts the ball into the
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
board's court in the sense that
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
do your job
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
and no problem and
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
short of that
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
i mean is that does that not satisfy
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
your concerns in in the sense of the
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
oplc taking over basically a board's
 
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.589 align:start position:0%
oplc taking over basically a board's
function

00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
to be brutally honest with your
 
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative you you folks deal with
 
00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.470 align:start position:0%
representative you you folks deal with
this

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
a lot and you understand the ins and
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
outs more than i as i understand more
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
the ins and outs of labor than possibly
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
if you were coming to my committee
 
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.230 align:start position:0%
if you were coming to my committee
so

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
as i said i'm not opposed or against i
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that all avenues
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
are looked at to make sure this is not
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
more of a movement away from this
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
quote that was just stated that this is
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.109 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
it's not too much of a movement
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
away from what the board's
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are and toward the
 
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.510 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are and toward the
government

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
but yes it is
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
more pleasing to have that sentence in
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
there than not
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
boy i'd have to think about that
 
00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:00.390 align:start position:0%
boy i'd have to think about that
ultimately

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
some order to all of the occupations
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
that we have and i would say underlying
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
many of those have to do with safety i
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.109 align:start position:0%
agree with that
follow-up

00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
if the boards have the authority
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
and they do not meet
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
unlike your board and i believe that the
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
director did say that trade boards
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
have a better reputation than other
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
boards on meeting how would you
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative uh
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
we could sit down and have an hour-long
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
discussion about some of my ideas of the
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
oplc and what should be done but i'm not
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
going to disagree with what again
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to keep saying the same thing
 
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.510 align:start position:0%
i'm going to keep saying the same thing
guys

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
guys
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not in agreement or disagreement of
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
this i just want to make sure it's not
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
an overreach
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
remember scitec
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
well it could be that the electrician's
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
board is a little more important than
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
the board of hammock safety something
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
like that but my question is this
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
do you does the electrician's board deny
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
a license if somebody had a felony
 
00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.710 align:start position:0%
a license if somebody had a felony
conviction

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
conviction
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.349 align:start position:0%
we have
why

00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
ah the example i just told you
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
that kind of felony okay
 
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
we get people coming in front of us that
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
have been convicted of mostly
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
related crimes where they were involved
 
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
with a break-in because of that they
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
present to us
 
00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
how they were incarcerated rehabilitated
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
they get usually something for a parole
 
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.030 align:start position:0%
they get usually something for a parole
officer

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
they talk about the programs they've
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
been involved with and how they're back
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
on the straight and narrow and you know
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
we have to evaluate those things
 
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.430 align:start position:0%
we have to evaluate those things
okay

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:52.230 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
infant time would you be
 
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
pleased to know that this bill actually
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
changes the current law which says that
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
if you apply for any license
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
if the board does not meet within 60
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
days you will get such a license
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
so that you could for example get a
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
doctor's license from the board of
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
medicine regardless of your
 
00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:15.829 align:start position:0%
medicine regardless of your
qualifications

00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to stop that
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
is that does that reassure
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
your a few of your concerns
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
there are other questions
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
testimony we'll have to consider this
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
thank you it's always uh
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
good to be in front of edna okay
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
is there any other person who wishes to
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none i'll close the

no

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to open the public hearing
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
for house bill 1018 right relative to
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
the board of medical imaging and

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
as the committee is aware we
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
are the state agency charged with
 
00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
providing administrative support to
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 boards that have
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
independent regulatory authority
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we also
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
directly regulate for professions with
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
advice of advisory councils
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
we've we've had a lot of discussion i
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
think earlier about uh some issues at
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
oplc issues with the board's issues with
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
the agency and structure
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
from my perspective
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
for an occupational licensing structure
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
to be successful
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
the state really has to leverage
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
expertise of professionals in those
 
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.390 align:start position:0%
expertise of professionals in those
occupations

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
occupations
 
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
there are some there are some states
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
that that don't do that at all and i
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
think that you lose
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
the ability to accurately protect the
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
public if you don't actually know how to
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
practice your profession
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
but you also need individuals who are
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
well experienced at administrative law
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
and procedure
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
and you need to marry the two together
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
so members of the regulated professions
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
are certainly experts in their fields
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
they're generally not experts in
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
administrative law and procedure
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
state officials may have vast experience
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
in administrative law but they don't
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
know anything about a particular
 
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.589 align:start position:0%
know anything about a particular
profession

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
so how do these individuals how should
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
they work together
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that the needs are
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
met of the state i think it has to be a
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
harmonious relationship in order to
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
achieve the state's mission of
 
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
protecting the public
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
the structure this structure really
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
breaks down when a body is not able to
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
or is not consistently able to perform
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
its role in the relationship and as as
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
you've heard earlier today on other and
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
there are several plc boards that either
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
do not have a quorum or are struggling
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
to consistently maintain a quorum
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
this obviously significantly impacts
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
licensure and the state's ability to
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
protect the public
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
i truly think that most of these issues
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
are due the fact that our health care
 
00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
boards are comprised largely of
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
individuals who are working in the
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
health care field which is experiencing
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
dire shortages
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
and it's not for lack of you know
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to to show up and attend and
 
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.710 align:start position:0%
wanting to to show up and attend and
participate

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
but those people are obviously
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
desperately needed on the front line and
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
not necessarily all the time in board
 
00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:27.750 align:start position:0%
not necessarily all the time in board
meetings

00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that changing
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
those boards that are facing quorum
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
issues in particular
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
would permit board members to freely
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
provide their expertise
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
concerning potential regulatory changes
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
and licensure
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
and other matters even if they lack a
 
00:51:43.839 --> 00:51:45.109 align:start position:0%
and other matters even if they lack a
quorum

00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
so for an example my
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
electrology advisory committee
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
the agency itself has rule making
 
00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.470 align:start position:0%
the agency itself has rule making
authority

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
um for
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
a long time
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
the rules had been expired i think
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
dating back to when they were at dhhs
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
we had not we have not been able to
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
convene a physical quorum of the
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
committee but i was able to have
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
conversations with these committee
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
members and we were able to put together
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
a draft and file rules
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
that everybody was
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable with
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
and government continue on
 
00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:21.349 align:start position:0%
and government continue on
so

00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
when oplc was considering which boards
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
should potentially move to an advisory
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
model which is the model that many other
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
states use for small professions
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
this board came to mind as it as it
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
struggled to me once the boards were no
 
00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
longer permitted
 
00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
to have remote meetings in may
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
the board did not hold monthly meetings
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
in may and june the september and
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
november meetings were canceled due to
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
lack of a quorum
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
but they have they have been
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
making good efforts
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
to meet understanding that it's
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
important they did meet in july august
 
00:52:55.359 --> 00:52:56.549 align:start position:0%
important they did meet in july august
october

00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
october
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i think this past month
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
the agency which is just wishes to
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
protect the public by ensuring qualified
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
applicants can be licensed in a timely
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
fashion and that the state has a
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
mechanism to effectively regulate this
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
profession we've talked about
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
contingency plans this is one type of
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
contingency plan to make sure that the
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
state has the ability
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
to regulate the profession
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
oplc has watched healthcare board
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
members struggle to take time out of
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
their busy lives to attend board
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
meetings and
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
i significantly appreciate their service
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
i've got people traveling down
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
from littleton
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
but we also understand that they're
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
they're often needed elsewhere and often
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
with lack of
 
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
with lack of
notice

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
we are extremely concerned that if
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
meetings are not consistently held that
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
some individuals may be improperly
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
licensed or not licensed in a timely
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
manner and complaints will not be
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
addressed we we do have boards that have
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
complaints as i've noted that are not
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
being adjudicated
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
so i think moving this certain boards to
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
an advisory model would permit the state
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
to leverage the board members expertise
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
while ensuring that the state performs
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
the duties it's required to do in order
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
to adequately protect the public
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
and we certainly think that the mrt
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
board fits that bill
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to provide
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
comments i'm happy to answer any
 
00:54:15.359 --> 00:54:17.349 align:start position:0%
comments i'm happy to answer any
questions

00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson you're
 
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.190 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pearson you're
recognized

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
in looking over this and this may this
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
is directed to you and to
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
um both representative golia mcguire to
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
think about here when we
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
when we change the definition of board
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
on page one line three
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
to make it an advisory board that that's
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
all well and good
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
but when you go through the rest of this
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill the word board is struck out
 
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.430 align:start position:0%
bill the word board is struck out
of

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.630 align:start position:0%
of
everything

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:49.829 align:start position:0%
everything
so

00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
we change the definition of board and
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
then we removed the word board from
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
from this particular area of regulation
 
00:54:58.799 --> 00:54:59.750 align:start position:0%
from this particular area of regulation
so

00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.430 align:start position:0%
so
i'm

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
on the surface i see that as a is
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
potentially a fundamental flaw here
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
you've created an advi you know you've
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
now changed it to an advisory board
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
but the advisory board now has no
 
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.069 align:start position:0%
but the advisory board now has no
function

00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
as it's been struck out
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
and changed to executive director
 
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:25.349 align:start position:0%
and changed to executive director
everywhere

00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
i would disagree um this is the
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
statutory framework for our other
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
advisory boards
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
in the sense that the agency itself
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
has regulatory authority
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
typically with consultation
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
and we would certainly support a change
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
that would require consultation
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
um with advisory boards but the advisory
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
boards that we currently have um
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
don't have independent regulatory
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
authority and that
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
so that there's typically a statute that
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
sets forth what the advisory board is
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to do
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
and you can see that in line
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
21 the advisory board shall advise the
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
executive director regarding the
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
implementation of this chapter
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
if we retained the board language in all
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
of these areas
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
like 24 for example
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
if it if we retained the board shall
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
adopt rules pursuant to rsa 541 relative
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
to yadda yadda we wouldn't exactly solve
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
the problem because we would still need
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
to convene a quorum of the board that
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
may not may or may not be meeting in
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
that particular area i can i can clearly
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
see your point there it's just in other
 
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.630 align:start position:0%
see your point there it's just in other
areas

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
it seems as though you have an advisory
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
board that has no authority to advise
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
anywhere because you've removed them
 
00:56:46.559 --> 00:56:47.430 align:start position:0%
anywhere because you've removed them
from

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
from everything
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's just i'm trying to get a sense of
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
and you're doing a good job explaining
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
it as to what what this
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
what this picture looks like now
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it could probably be better
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
described it's it's certainly described
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
in lines 20 and 21
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
shall advise the executive director
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
regarding the implementation of this
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
chapter there certainly could be
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
parameters around that you know shall
 
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
the executive director shall call a
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
meeting x number of times a year or
 
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.990 align:start position:0%
meeting x number of times a year or
whatever

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
to make it clearer as to their function
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
because i certainly think that like i
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
said earlier we need to
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
essentially marry the two functions
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
together we need to carry out the
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
functions that that the state has
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
directed us to do
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
but we also need to leverage their
 
00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:34.630 align:start position:0%
but we also need to leverage their
expertise

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
and that has to be an important part of
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
and uh this is sort of addressed to
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
who i think will be the chair of the
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
we had agreed the four of us
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
representatives maguire goalie schmidt
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
and myself
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsor most of these advisory
 
00:58:03.839 --> 00:58:06.870 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsor most of these advisory
board

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
possibilities

00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
possibilities
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
this one you see does not have my name
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
on it so i didn't see the language until
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
after the bill was
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
technically made public
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
i went through the bills that i
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
sponsored primary
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
and in various places where it required
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
decisions about education administrative
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
rules what have you
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
and change the language to say the
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the advisory board
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
which i think enables the board to still
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
be the one making the considerations
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
and i would propose that this bill be
 
00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.670 align:start position:0%
and i would propose that this bill be
amended

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
in the places where it does not
 
00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:53.990 align:start position:0%
in the places where it does not
specifically

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:54.950 align:start position:0%
specifically
um

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
inhibit the representative duties
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
i i think we might be going down down a
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole of this might be better
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
discussion for our executive session i'm
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
stating this to then say to
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
the person testifying would that be
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
agreeable to you
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
thank you that was my point
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative sytek and then
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think now my question is redundant
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
because it
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
the representative show it's in
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
consultation with i was going to ask why
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
not just put or
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
yeah you can i
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i think
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
the issue right is who decides where
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
we've had issues uh i'll give you a
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
prime example um body art um there needs
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
to be some sort of veto capacity
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
the the board had sought legislation to
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
allow other members of the profession of
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
the cosmetology profession not body
 
00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
artists to perform microblading
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
so we so we pursued that bill um
 
01:00:01.839 --> 01:00:02.789 align:start position:0%
so we so we pursued that bill um
and

01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
but but when it came time for rulemaking
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
they received a lot of nasty grams from
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
colleagues who were concerned that i'm
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
bringing in additional individuals
 
01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.549 align:start position:0%
bringing in additional individuals
would

01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
compete be you know basically put them
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
out of business so the body art board
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
turned about face and said we don't want
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
to do this anymore
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
um and i was able to say to direct them
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
no we have this regulatory requirement
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
we need to move forward
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
if it was an ore i'm not sure we would
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
have actually been able to accomplish
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
that so there i think there always needs
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question i think my
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
questioning is following the same lines
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
as what uh representative schuett was
 
01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
going at i'd like to look at page 3 line
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
28 as an example where it's discussing
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
the educational qualifications of
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
these people
 
01:00:58.559 --> 01:00:59.990 align:start position:0%
these people
and

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if you truly believe the
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
executive director by herself or himself
 
01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
could set the criterion standards
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
or with that very specific instance
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
where it's a clinical decision and the
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
input of the board is actually
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
exceedingly valuable if we should in
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
every one of those places change it to
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
executive director in consultation with
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
the board whereas leaving all the
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
administration functions strictly with
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
the executive director we would support
 
01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.789 align:start position:0%
the executive director we would support
that

01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
do any other members have any questions
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
for miss courtney
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
are there any other members from the
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
public that wish to testify on house
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
bill 10 18.
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
i'll get you a pink card when i'm done
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
so uh being on the on the uh
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill as has had been noted with regard
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
to representation and representative
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
goalie and representative mcguire as
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
well uh we have a series of these bills
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
we're hearing today but i'm sure that
 
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
the committee has been getting a deluge
 
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.390 align:start position:0%
the committee has been getting a deluge
with

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
emails with regard to one of the
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent bills
 
01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.950 align:start position:0%
subsequent bills
where

01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
the public is very concerned about
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
stripping the the board members out of
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
any authority uh and
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
so i just want to say that
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the in the whole process of putting
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
these bills together
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
in consultation with oplc
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh the four
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh longer-serving members of the uh
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.950 align:start position:0%
have uh
uh

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
been willing to consider the idea of
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
restructuring uh the the nature of the
 
01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
relationship between boards and
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
the executive director
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
but always the underlying idea was uh to
 
01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.470 align:start position:0%
but always the underlying idea was uh to
uh

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
to have the executive director and the
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
and the oplc
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
do the administrative end of things
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
where they have expertise
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
retain their authority with regard to
 
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.190 align:start position:0%
retain their authority with regard to
the

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
niceties intricacies and
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
guts if you will of
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
the profession uh where they have the
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
expertise so
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
i kind of like as i like to say you know
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
the left leg does its job the right leg
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
does its job uh that's what we call
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
walking and you have to have at least
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
two legs to be able to walk
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh and if you are
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
crippled and have only one
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
functioning leg you may be able to hop
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
like heck but you can't walk
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh so what we want to do with regard to
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh to this
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
concept we're trying to develop here
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
is to have the agency function
 
01:04:01.039 --> 01:04:02.069 align:start position:0%
is to have the agency function
uh

01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
in a in a degree with regard to the
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
administrative end of things and the the
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
board members and the professionals to
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
retain their their authority their
 
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
influence their oversight and so forth
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
with regard to the the profession itself
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
um and and that's what we
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's what this previous colloquy
 
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
between representative schuett
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
represented mars marsh versus pearson
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the chair uh have been attempting to
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
do i just want to emphasize that that
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
that that's a discussion that several of
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
us uh that are on these bills have been
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
having uh so we are in full support of
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
the idea of streamlining things
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
improving the function
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
but not in any way of taking the
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
professionals out of
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
their area of expertise
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
but rather to uh to lighten the burden
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
on them with regard to administrative
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
things where they may not be all that
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable they may not have legal
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
background administrative background
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
they know their profession
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
um and that's where we should uh
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
emphasize their activity on the board
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
but in no way is is my intent as a
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill to be that the
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
the executive director will become the
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
be all and end-all and the advisory the
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
the board members the professionals uh
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
will be along for the ride but uh but
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
have effectively no say
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh so that's uh that's a no-go on my
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
part so uh i've been on the thing i
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
could not be asking questions from the
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
side that you're on uh so i've chosen to
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh come up and testify but uh so i i
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
hope making it clear we're going to be
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
seeing this especially
 
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
when we get to midwifery a little bit
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
later in
 
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
today's list
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
but i'll ask answer any questions people
 
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this will probably go to
 
01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
at least a tiny subcommittee
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
and would you think is do you think
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea to put in
 
01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the board can
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
itself call for a meeting doesn't does a
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill say that
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
i think if we're is going to go to a
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we ought to have a dialogue
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
with regard to how we see this new
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
concept as being most
 
01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.549 align:start position:0%
concept as being most
effective

01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
because we certainly do not want to get
 
01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
into a situation where the
 
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.349 align:start position:0%
into a situation where the
uh

01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
where the advisory board is effectively
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
powerless uh they're just uh
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
a gab fest
 
01:06:43.039 --> 01:06:43.990 align:start position:0%
a gab fest
uh

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
or a
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
coffee clutch uh so i i think your
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
suggestion is
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
as viable as we as
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
some of the other ideas we've been
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.589 --> 01:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
members of the public that will testify
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
for house bill 1018
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the public
 
01:07:13.359 --> 01:07:20.470 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the public
hearing

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go into executive session if
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
if there are no
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:22.709 align:start position:0%
 
fine

01:08:22.709 --> 01:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
and representative goalie you have a
 
01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:31.749 align:start position:0%
and representative goalie you have a
motion

01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
will move that we
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
by representative o'brien
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
if you do you wish to speak to your
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
motion representative goalie uh briefly
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
i think uh we heard that
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
currently there is no way for
 
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.789 align:start position:0%
currently there is no way for
[Music]

01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
the director or anyone to
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
stop handing out licenses if a board
 
01:09:21.269 --> 01:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
shall not meet and make a determination
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
within a certain time frame on a number
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
of licensures
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
and this addresses that issue
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
and will give the director some
 
01:09:30.719 --> 01:09:32.789 align:start position:0%
and will give the director some
oversight

01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
if this happens um so i think this is a
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
positive move and
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
i hope everyone will support it okay
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien you we should
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
chair we go thank you madam chair uh
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative cooley was quite eloquent
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh not much to say other than uh i do
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
believe the testimony director courtney
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
shows the need for this bill and thus
 
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
supporting it thank
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you is there anyone else who
 
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak representative
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think we're
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
licensing way too many professions and i
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
think in a case where if the board can't
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
even be
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
people either aren't willing to be on
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
the board or they uh
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
can't even bother to meet we should drop
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
licensing for it rather than um than
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
doing this so i will be voting against
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative schmidt
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'll defer to represent pearson for the
 
01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
i'll defer to represent pearson for the
moment

01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
the the function the function of
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
government you know as we talk about the
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
word function is is
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
it has to function i mean as cheesy as
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds and when we clearly have a
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
situation where government does not
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
function that does not serve
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
anyone it doesn't serve the people it
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't serve the professions it doesn't
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
serve the agency it doesn't serve the
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
consumer it doesn't serve anybody
 
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:06.950 align:start position:0%
consumer it doesn't serve anybody
so

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know we've those of us that have
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
been on this
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee for a while have seen time and
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
time again where we have examples of of
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
the inability to function
 
01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.030 align:start position:0%
the inability to function
so

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
so
having

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation come forward
 
01:11:21.679 --> 01:11:22.630 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation come forward
to

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
provide an avenue to cr
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
intervene in some of the functionality
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
issues i think is a good thing
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
this is not a takeover
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
i call these trigger bills because you
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
know in the event of if an agency fails
 
01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
know in the event of if an agency fails
if

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
some you know if the people the main
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
body doesn't do something
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
then action gets transferred it doesn't
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
strip the power away from a board
 
01:11:51.669 --> 01:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
as long as the board does its job and i
 
01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
think that not only is this triggering
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill not a takeover but maybe it's a
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of a kind of a kick in the
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
seat to some of these boards to say hey
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know the fact that you wanted to be
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
on a board but you're not going to show
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
up for the next two years isn't going to
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
fly anymore
 
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
so i do support this um
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
this broad effort here and then you know
 
01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
we can get into the minutia of the 54
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
different boards as to as to whether or
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
not those need specific
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
either modifications or removals but as
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
a general overall broad
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
ability to keep
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire running in
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
regards to this i think this is uh this
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair and thank you
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative pearson for your uh for
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
your take on the issue uh i i also am
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the idea that if we have
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
a uh you know the
 
01:12:46.719 --> 01:12:47.430 align:start position:0%
a uh you know the
the

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
government being hamstrung by
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
a refusal of a board uh to function
 
01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.709 align:start position:0%
a refusal of a board uh to function
uh

01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
then we
 
01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
that's not the public interest and we
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
certainly should be um
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
be trying to remedy that situation so as
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
i say i'm
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
fundamentally sympathetic to the idea uh
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
i guess i would have preferred if we
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
had had some kind of a a subcommittee
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
frankly where we could have kicked
 
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.430 align:start position:0%
frankly where we could have kicked
around

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
the various different possibilities or
 
01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
ramifications here because we are
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
basically uh you know enabling uh
 
01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
basically uh you know enabling uh
the

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
the government to go forward
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh on virtually anything and and if
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
we're issuing a license or a permit uh
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
for some action uh we're this is a jump
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
off the cliff um to some degree
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
if we have not had an opportunity to
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
think through
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
some of the ramifications as i say of
 
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.110 align:start position:0%
some of the ramifications as i say of
what

01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
might be done
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
aren't you
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
you're confusing that with the bill we
 
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
passed last year where we said if the
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
boards don't act the oplc will issue a
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
license within 60 days this is a
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
restriction on the ability of the oplc
 
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
to issue the license well
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
that's why i
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
i think we i would have preferred
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
if i it's a
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
question of yay or nay i'm likely to say
 
01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.630 align:start position:0%
question of yay or nay i'm likely to say
yeah

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
but i i hope we'll have a thorough
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
discussion of because this is pretty
 
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.870 align:start position:0%
discussion of because this is pretty
open-ended

01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
open-ended
 
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.990 align:start position:0%
open-ended
and

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just a little bit uh reluctant to to
 
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
proceed without uh having had that
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
discussion and here in executive session
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're already making a
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh a statement of ought to pass without
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh without uh
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
exploring this a little bit further
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
while i agree enthusiastically with
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis about too many
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
boards being
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
pre in their in this quorum issue
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
i will be voting for this because it's a
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction because we
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
are growing rapidly think about this on
 
01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:12.870 align:start position:0%
are growing rapidly think about this on
tuesday

01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
director courtney told us there were 50
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
licensed boards now there's 58 today so
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's even in the past couple days it's
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
just exploded i mean it's just wow hi
 
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.950 align:start position:0%
just exploded i mean it's just wow hi
breathtaking

01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's a good point representative
 
01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.950 align:start position:0%
that's a good point representative
goalie

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
goalie
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i just want to
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
address the comments by representative
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
schmidt about jumping off the cliff
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think this puts the rails at the top
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
of the cliff and stopping the jumping
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
this allows the
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
executive director to
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
prevent someone from getting a license
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
if they're not qualified this allows
 
01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
that to happen currently
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
we're jumping off the cliff by handing
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
out licenses if the time frame isn't met
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
we heard if you wanted to be an
 
01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.790 align:start position:0%
we heard if you wanted to be an
audiologist

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
audiologist
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
during covert was the time to go do it
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
because you didn't need any
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
credentialing just apply
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
and you given the license because
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
nobody's reviewing them and nobody's the
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
boards aren't meeting
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
this allows her to stop that from
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
happening this puts the rails up on the
 
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
top of the cliff and isn't jumping over
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
the cliff anymore that's what's
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
important about this thank you other
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
other comments representative allegro
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'm really
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
torn on this one and i kind of
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
want to reflect
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
or reiterate some of the concerns of
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis and infantine i'm
 
01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure at this very second which
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
but like rep lekkis
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
i worry that we create bureaucracies
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
and then we grow them and then we bring
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
them under government control
 
01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that that's an
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
improvement so i just wanted to express
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
that sentiment thank you
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative pearson i
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
would just like to
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
once again reiterate that this is a
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
triggering bill in the sense that
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
this does not
 
01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
transfer authority
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
directly to
 
01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
the administration of oplc it requires a
 
01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.390 align:start position:0%
the administration of oplc it requires a
board

01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
to fail to do its job before that occurs
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
where authority is is being moved it's
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's actually not being moved at all the
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
boards still retain everything here it's
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
just if they don't do their job
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
now we have a mechanism for government
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions comments
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none i'd like to say i agree
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
the rail at the top of the cliff because
 
01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
the rail at the top of the cliff because
the

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
as as the law stands right now
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
oplc is required to issue a license to
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
somebody that on the application form
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
clearly does not meet the requirements
 
01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
and they still must give them
 
01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.430 align:start position:0%
and they still must give them
a

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
a license
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
i believe that's an unacceptable
 
01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.270 align:start position:0%
i believe that's an unacceptable
situation

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:18:09.669 --> 01:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative scitec representative
 
01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.950 align:start position:0%
representative scitec representative
schmidt

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
don't let the perfect be the enemy of
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
the good
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh sentiment
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand why people
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
support this um and
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
i mean there is an issue where
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
if you give somebody a license without
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
checking at all
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
in effect you're putting the state's
 
01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
imprimatur on them as being okay
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
when we haven't done anything and i
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
understand that concern
 
01:18:43.679 --> 01:18:44.470 align:start position:0%
understand that concern
but

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
my issue with licensing and all the
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
professions we're licensing that i don't
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
think we should will result in my my
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
voting no although i understand it's
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to pass but thank you
 
01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.229 align:start position:0%
it's going to pass but thank you
representative

01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
i would just point out to the newer
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
members of this committee that
 
01:19:05.350 --> 01:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
we've put a lot of the restrictions on
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
licensing people particularly in the
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
medical professions in place
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
after what happened at exeter hospital
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar there was a med
 
01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
tech there who
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
i actually was an orderly i think
 
01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.270 align:start position:0%
i actually was an orderly i think
who

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
ended up
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
through miss actions which should have
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
been caught through criminal records
 
01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.630 align:start position:0%
been caught through criminal records
checks

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
checks
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
ended up killing several patients at the
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
hospital and a lot of these protections
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
were put in place because of that but
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the situation we're in right now
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
those protections are not being looked
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
at necessarily
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
so i would hope that you would support
 
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.149 align:start position:0%
so i would hope that you would support
this

01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
and give the board
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
i mean sorry the oplc the opportunity to
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
stop someone like that
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
at least temporarily from actually i
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that person would
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
have been disqualified because you'd
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
have to look at the criminal records
 
01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.910 align:start position:0%
have to look at the criminal records
checks

01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
checks
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
and that's not something the oplc is
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
he did have the technical protection
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair he did have
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
some bad reports from previous
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
jobs maybe
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
yes i think the issue of whether we
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
should be licensing a profession or not
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
is something that we will be discussing
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
in great detail
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the future and probably forever
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
but in this case where we have regulated
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
professions that
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
can be granted licenses with
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
without meeting the minimum statutory
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
requirements is something that is i
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
think a failure of of the government
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
all right having had the last word the
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass by
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%

so our committee subcommittee met this
 
01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:18.830 align:start position:0%
so our committee subcommittee met this
morning

01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
we discussed the bill the i.t director
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
was here
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of the bill was here some
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
supporters we went through
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
the information
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
i got from the director
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
i can send it to the full committee it's
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
very interesting it's
 
01:23:36.239 --> 01:23:37.189 align:start position:0%
very interesting it's
what

01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
what his job entails it's
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of computers it's um
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
11 000 and licensed end users for pcs
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
it's 2500 mobile phones it's 350 tablets
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
handheld tablets it's a bunch of cloud
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
services from amazon and
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
in the future google microsoft and
 
01:23:58.480 --> 01:23:59.750 align:start position:0%
in the future google microsoft and
salesforce

01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
salesforce
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
and his department is running over a
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
the budget for the department is 100
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars so i i think
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
the way yeah i described it was i don't
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
want to micromanage it
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily and tell him what to use
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's a dell computer or hp
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
computer he has to buy
 
01:24:22.709 --> 01:24:22.719 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
is brought forward is a very complex
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill it touches upon different many
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
different parts we discussed it also
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
that maybe it's a good idea to break it
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
up and send it to various
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
other committees because it talks about
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
criminal justice issues such as
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh the right
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
to well face the accuser and the
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
question the devices used in criminal
 
01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
proceedings it talks about
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions and businesses it talks
 
01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:47.990 align:start position:0%
restrictions and businesses it talks
about

01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.510 align:start position:0%
about
the

01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
council the advisory council
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsor wants to be brought forward
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
to discuss open source it talks about
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
copyright issues which i don't think the
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
state gets involved in at all even
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
um that's why we moved it to itl
 
01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
needs to work with the director and
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
other parties and
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
break it up and produce different bills
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you represent goalie do you wish
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%

very briefly noah and we have a another
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
hearing um i think
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative jacobovich
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%

did a great synopsis of the subcommittee
and

01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
the agreement was that if there were
 
01:25:29.189 --> 01:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
seven different portions of this
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
some dealing with criminal justice
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
others that might have been better off
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
going to science in tech that he bring
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
this back and hopefully goes to the
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate committees thank you
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%

representative marsh
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh thank you mr chairman uh i
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
intend to vote in favor of this motion
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
that that being said uh i
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why is because i agree this
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
bill is not ready for prime time at this
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
point in time it
 
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
many of us were first year reps it takes
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
a while to learn how to write a good
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
bill but we've all been there we've all
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
done that that being said i do believe
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
that there's substantial savings that we
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
could achieve in the state of new
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire by increasing our use of free
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
and open source software a very easy to
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
understand example would be using
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
libreoffice instead of microsoft word
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
which i think represents a substantial
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh expenditure by the icc that i believe
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
the department of
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
information technology has already made
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
that rather obvious step
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
i understand that but but that that
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
being said i think there is free soft
 
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
free and open source software and cost
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
savings to be had but this bill is not
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time thank you there is
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
another bill about open source software
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
that is recommended to pass with
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that might address some of
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
your issues yes i saw his hand thank you
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative laccas
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you i agree with representative
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
marsh the only thing i'll say in
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
addition is that
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
it might make sense for it would make
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
more sense for the i.t council to take
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
this up and as was mentioned during the
 
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.229 align:start position:0%
this up and as was mentioned during the
hearing

01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
it might make sense to you know put an
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
additional rep or maybe change the
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
membership in that but that's a separate
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
issue from this bill so thank you
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%

that's as much as i'm going to grovel
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
but in any case i i do like the
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee and
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
after 15 16 years
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased to bring uh house bill 1330
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
before the committee for its usual
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
thorough examination of the issues
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
one of these examples of
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
being

01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
put into a new
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
mode where the executive director
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
the attempt as i stated in the earlier
 
01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.870 align:start position:0%
the attempt as i stated in the earlier
bill

01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
previous bill is that
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
we want to attempt to shift
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
some of the workload
 
01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.149 align:start position:0%
some of the workload
uh

01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
more effectively from
 
01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:33.590 align:start position:0%
more effectively from
the

01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
not doing certain administrative things
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
that it perhaps does not have as much
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
expertise in
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
and by the same token maintaining
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh and and we may find that the language
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
needs the same kind of modification that
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about before where
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
things have to be done
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
um in consultation with the
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
the experts in the profession so that we
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
do not in any way
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
kind of neuter
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
and the practitioners in the process of
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
governing them
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
by the same token
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
and conversations that we've had
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
with the um
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
with the executive director and with
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
some of the technicians over at oplc
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is that very often
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
boards do not have
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
the kind of certainly the the kind of
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
legal and administrative
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
firepower or background or in some cases
 
01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.950 align:start position:0%
firepower or background or in some cases
knowledge

01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
that the oplc has that's why they have
 
01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.310 align:start position:0%
that the oplc has that's why they have
attorneys

01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
and administrators and and we want to
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
get the the walking process to use my
 
01:37:53.350 --> 01:37:53.360 align:start position:0%
previous analogy the walking process to
 
01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.070 align:start position:0%
previous analogy the walking process to
be

01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
more one uh
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
where the the each each entity is doing
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
the area and the the activity
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
and the operation that it has expertise
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
and firepower if you will
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
in and and not be doing something in
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
which they are not so expert but um i'm
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that um and i'm seeing
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh the director here
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know that you're playing
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
testify can i
 
01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.430 align:start position:0%
testify can i
momentarily

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
momentarily
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
you are planning to testify thank you
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
very much director courtney um so with
 
01:38:31.669 --> 01:38:31.679 align:start position:0%
that uh since uh i i
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
performed my
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
most important task and that is is
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill uh i will defer to
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh director courtney for her expertise
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
on this particular issue thank you
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
oh good written testimony this time
 
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
call director
 
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.350 align:start position:0%
call director
courtney

01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:14.709 --> 01:39:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:39:16.149 --> 01:39:16.159 align:start position:0%
committee lindsay courtney executive
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
director oplc
 
01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
this is currently a board that lacks a
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
quorum statutorily
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
there are two members
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe one has indicated they
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
intend to resign sometime this summer
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
so at present uh they have not been able
 
01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:39.109 align:start position:0%
 
2021

01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
2021
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
sorry not two thousand thank you i was
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
that seemed a little ridiculous
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
and and this is a newer profession um
 
01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
that this is uh the medical technicians
 
01:39:48.159 --> 01:39:49.030 align:start position:0%
that this is uh the medical technicians
board

01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
was fairly recently established
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
um so certainly our concerns are that
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's no statutory authority for us to
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
deny applications if the individual is
 
01:40:01.590 --> 01:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
not qualified it looks like um that
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1095 would resolve that
 
01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:04.870 align:start position:0%
house bill 1095 would resolve that
problem

01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
but the board cannot conduct rulemaking
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
nor can the board take disciplinary
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
action because they do not have a quorum
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
the agency has received complaints but
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's no body that can act on such
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
complaints and as such we're greatly
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
concerned that the state is not meeting
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
its obligation to protect the public
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
which this legislature has decided
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
licensure is required in this field
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
certainly changing the board to an
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
advisory board is one way that would
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
permit the agency to act in the absence
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
of a quorum the agency could seek advice
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
of board members
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
to evaluate complaints register
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
individuals and deny registrations to
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not qualified
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
given the fact that essentially this
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
aspect of government is non-functional
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
oplc urges your support of this bill and
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for before we get to the
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
questions i'd like to comment that this
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
will be going to representative
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
yakubovich's subcommittee
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
combing of where we need to put in the
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
in consultation with language
 
01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.629 align:start position:0%
in consultation with language
which

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
after the previous discussions i'm sure
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
specify exactly where you need to have
 
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to worry about
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
that kind of detail representative marsh
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sharon and thank you for
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
commission can you tell me how many
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
states at this point in time currently
 
01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
licensed medical technologists and i
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up question my
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is we're the only state
 
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.830 align:start position:0%
understanding is we're the only state
representative

01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay my my follow-up question is
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
can you tell me any circumstances where
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
a medical technologist would be
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
practicing independently not under the
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
supervision of their employer who may
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
have credentials
 
01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:56.310 align:start position:0%
have credentials
no

01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:57.490 align:start position:0%
medical technicians are
 
01:41:57.490 --> 01:41:58.790 align:start position:0%
medical technicians are
[Music]

01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding they're required
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
to act under supervision of a
 
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:03.109 align:start position:0%
to act under supervision of a
practitioner

01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh and one last follow-up question
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh
 
01:42:08.709 --> 01:42:08.719 align:start position:0%
given those two answers would you be
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
supportive of uh bill if we amend this
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
to just simply repeal this licensure
 
01:42:16.629 --> 01:42:16.639 align:start position:0%
um i
 
01:42:16.639 --> 01:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
um i
i

01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
i would be willing to explore that um
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm familiar with the concerns
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
obviously surrounding hepatitis c i
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
represented actually half of the
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs in their lawsuits against
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
exeter hospitals so i'm intimately aware
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
of i think the knee-jerk reaction
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
after that
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
crisis or that issue but i you know i do
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
think that the data demonstrates that if
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
we are the only state that actually
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
licenses these individuals the state may
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
need to take it and take a further look
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not that's actually
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
required i i thank you and as a hospital
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
trustee was also interested in the
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reaction to exeter hospital
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
who believes that the hospitals are
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
taking adequate precautions to protect
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
the public i would agree that this is
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
not a necessary function of your
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
currently overworked department so thank
 
01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:02.950 align:start position:0%
currently overworked department so thank
you

01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh i wish
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
you'd been on this committee a couple of
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
years ago when we faced the pleas to
 
01:43:09.119 --> 01:43:10.629 align:start position:0%
years ago when we faced the pleas to
register

01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
register
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
all right are there any other questions
 
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
represent pearson
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah just reading through this
 
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
similar to the prior one
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
the fifa renewal is struck out
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't see
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
a because we've done this before with
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
with fixed numbers right we've let that
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
left that to the discretion of oplc to
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have fair and adequate
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
um renewal fees across the
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
50 to
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
58 boards depending on what uh
 
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
what time of day it is so
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
with this being struck out i i don't see
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
a mechanism in place
 
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
to have it
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
mirror what we've done in other places
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
is that covered by another piece of
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
statute carte blanche and that's why
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's not in here or do we need to fix
 
01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:14.470 align:start position:0%
that's not in here or do we need to fix
that

01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
yes it's covered by rsa 310 a
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
colon one dash
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
which grants
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
the authority to the executive director
 
01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
to promulgate rules regarding fees
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
awesome thank you
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
other questions comments
 
01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.669 align:start position:0%
other questions comments
well

01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
congratulations thank you very much
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.310 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
before we close madam chair i was
 
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could if we could do
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
something a little out of the ordinary
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
here it seems
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
yes it seems that there seems to be a
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
an opinion here as to whether or not
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
this board should even exist
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
so perhaps we should have some sort of
 
01:45:03.189 --> 01:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
discussion in reference to that because
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
sending this to representative
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
yakubovich's subcommittee to to tweak it
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
may be unnecessary if if this is
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
something we need we want to dissolve in
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
its entirety i
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
i agree with you wholeheartedly and i
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
believe that subcommittee would be the
 
01:45:20.550 --> 01:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
best place to discuss that
 
01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:21.990 align:start position:0%
best place to discuss that
and

01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be a germain
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
amendment if if they should decide to do
 
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:31.830 align:start position:0%
amendment if if they should decide to do
so

01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions no seeing
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
none well as as long as you're asking
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
for a comment uh i i i think it's
 
01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
important for the newer members to
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
understand uh that
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
point of order madam chairman uh i'm not
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
a point of order
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt is
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
in his teaching mode at the moment well
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
i i believe that if you recess the
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
public hearing then you could call an
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
executive session and comments from the
 
01:46:00.149 --> 01:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
our committee would be in order but
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
you're correct i was out of order to
 
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
call for comments
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
are there is there anyone else who
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
i'll close the public hearing
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative yakubovich i trust you
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
will schedule a
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%

of the office of op plc
and

03:01:20.790 --> 03:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:23.030 --> 03:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say considering how much
 
03:01:25.190 --> 03:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
attention it seems to have gone
 
03:01:28.630 --> 03:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
that is that it is not an attempt to
 
03:01:28.640 --> 03:01:29.550 align:start position:0%
that is that it is not an attempt to
remove

03:01:29.550 --> 03:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
remove
 
03:01:31.550 --> 03:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
self-regulation from the
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
midwifery profession
 
03:01:38.429 --> 03:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
it is an intent to consolidate the
 
03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
administrative functions
 
03:01:43.349 --> 03:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
away from the board and have them
 
03:01:46.710 --> 03:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
concentrate on the professional aspects
 
03:01:47.750 --> 03:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
such as
 
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation of applicants
 
03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:51.429 align:start position:0%
evaluation of applicants
consideration

03:01:51.429 --> 03:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:01:51.439 --> 03:01:53.110 align:start position:0%
consideration
of

03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:01:55.030 --> 03:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
continuing education
 
03:01:57.349 --> 03:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
and any disciplinary actions that might
 
03:01:58.950 --> 03:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
be required
 
03:02:02.389 --> 03:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
and i know the board the bill does not
 
03:02:02.399 --> 03:02:03.590 align:start position:0%
and i know the board the bill does not
properly

03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
properly
 
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
address that in terms of
 
03:02:10.150 --> 03:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
where the executive director can act
 
03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
more or less
 
03:02:14.870 --> 03:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
on our own first you know establishing
 
03:02:17.110 --> 03:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
procedures and so collecting fees and
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
and where the board needs to get
 
03:02:22.710 --> 03:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
involved for technical and professional
 
03:02:25.269 --> 03:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
issues and therefore i expect it will be
 
03:02:27.670 --> 03:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee to deal with that
 
03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:28.469 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee to deal with that
and

03:02:28.469 --> 03:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
if that is the
 
03:02:35.269 --> 03:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
if if the language is confusing or it is
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't ex
 
03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:37.910 align:start position:0%
doesn't ex
express

03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
express
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
that intention
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
um i hope i hope it will not be taken
 
03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
badly if we correct it
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
and i'll answer any questions i can
 
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
03:02:52.630 --> 03:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman madam chairman and
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
i would specifically like to ask you
 
03:02:59.910 --> 03:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
about section two of the bill
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of background while i'm
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
a licensed physician we had our last two
 
03:03:05.110 --> 03:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
children at home with the midwife it was
 
03:03:07.670 --> 03:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
a very positive experience but from that
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
experience i became aware of some of the
 
03:03:11.590 --> 03:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
tensions between the medical profession
 
03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
and the midwives
 
03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
and my question relates to the advisory
 
03:03:17.190 --> 03:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
council established where you're
 
03:03:20.230 --> 03:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
establishing a council with
 
03:03:22.550 --> 03:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
that will consist two-thirds
 
03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:24.070 align:start position:0%
that will consist two-thirds
of

03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
physicians or aprns whereas the existing
 
03:03:29.349 --> 03:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
council is one-third of uh physicians
 
03:03:31.110 --> 03:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
and i would like to actually i believe
 
03:03:33.269 --> 03:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
the existing council is two physicians
 
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
one guy
 
03:03:36.630 --> 03:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
one obstetrician and one pediatrician
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
right two out of six members is
 
03:03:39.670 --> 03:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
one-third of the membership whereas here
 
03:03:41.510 --> 03:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's two out of three which makes it
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the membership so it seems
 
03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
to me that
 
03:03:47.030 --> 03:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know your rationale behind
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
making two-thirds of the advisory
 
03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
council people who are not midwives
 
03:03:53.510 --> 03:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
that was not
 
03:03:55.830 --> 03:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
as i said this bill was a request of the
 
03:03:57.750 --> 03:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
office of oplc and you'll have to ask
 
03:03:59.670 --> 03:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
them for that i didn't make that
 
03:04:05.990 --> 03:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:07.590 --> 03:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from the
 
03:04:07.600 --> 03:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions from the
members

03:04:09.670 --> 03:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:04:11.429 --> 03:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:36.630 --> 03:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
mr larue if you could accept my apology
 
03:04:38.469 --> 03:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
i did not see the representative
 
03:04:38.479 --> 03:04:48.830 align:start position:0%
i did not see the representative

schmidt as one of the co-sponsors i
 
03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak uh beforehand uh because

03:04:57.359 --> 03:04:58.790 align:start position:0%
uh i've had some considerable
conversations

to
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
assure the public that this this bill
 
03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
is not intended
 
03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:37.670 align:start position:0%
is not intended
to

03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:05:37.680 --> 03:05:38.389 align:start position:0%
to

downgrade or
 
03:05:40.479 --> 03:05:42.150 align:start position:0%
downgrade or
oppress

03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
oppress
 
03:05:43.750 --> 03:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
midwives or the
 
03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
midwifery profession in any way
 
03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately has a couple of
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
significant deficiencies that need to be
 
03:05:51.840 --> 03:05:53.030 align:start position:0%
significant deficiencies that need to be
addressed

03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
i am fully in support of midwifery and
 
03:05:57.349 --> 03:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
have been for many years although i've
 
03:06:00.309 --> 03:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
never had to avail myself of a midwife's
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
experience my daughter was born 56 years
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:09.429 --> 03:06:09.439 align:start position:0%
but in any case
 
03:06:11.910 --> 03:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of the whole thing and
 
03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
the committee has heard this before on
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
some of the bills we heard previously
 
03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the the intention is to
 
03:06:18.960 --> 03:06:20.950 align:start position:0%
that the the intention is to
facilitate

03:06:20.950 --> 03:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
facilitate
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
the professions
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
03:06:26.950 --> 03:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
modifying in this fashion
 
03:06:30.630 --> 03:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
we did not pick on midwives or pick on
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
any other profession but rather selected
 
03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of small boards uh where we
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
could start off with the idea of trying
 
03:06:39.429 --> 03:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
to enhance
 
03:06:39.439 --> 03:06:41.349 align:start position:0%
to enhance
administration

03:06:41.349 --> 03:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:06:44.550 --> 03:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of professions where the
 
03:06:46.550 --> 03:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
board members may not have
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
indeed any board might might have the
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
same problem with
 
03:06:53.349 --> 03:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
members who are not particularly skilled
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
at administration
 
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
or in the law or whatever but they are
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
expert in their own profession that
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
certainly is the case with midwives
 
03:07:07.030 --> 03:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
and so what we want to do is
 
03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
allow the
 
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
these members one of the other bills is
 
03:07:13.030 --> 03:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
court reporters for example is also a
 
03:07:15.030 --> 03:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
small board a small number of
 
03:07:17.190 --> 03:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
practitioners uh
 
03:07:20.150 --> 03:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
enhance their ability to
 
03:07:20.160 --> 03:07:21.429 align:start position:0%
enhance their ability to
effectively

03:07:21.429 --> 03:07:21.439 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
engage in their own profession but also
 
03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
to give the oplc
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
the benefit of their experience in their
 
03:07:30.720 --> 03:07:32.309 align:start position:0%
the benefit of their experience in their
profession

03:07:32.309 --> 03:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:07:34.150 --> 03:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
without burdening them with
 
03:07:36.870 --> 03:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
administrative or personnel
 
03:07:39.510 --> 03:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
aspects at which they may not be
 
03:07:42.150 --> 03:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
particularly expert or in the law
 
03:07:43.349 --> 03:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding is this bill is going
 
03:07:48.550 --> 03:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
to to a subcommittee where we will be
 
03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
or we will be addressing the
 
03:07:49.840 --> 03:07:51.590 align:start position:0%
or we will be addressing the
deficiencies

03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
that are clearly
 
03:07:55.750 --> 03:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
manifest uh
 
03:07:58.950 --> 03:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
an immediate uh inspection of the of the
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
text where it
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
frequently just strikes out the board
 
03:08:05.990 --> 03:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
and substitutes the executive director
 
03:08:07.750 --> 03:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's clear and it was always our
 
03:08:09.590 --> 03:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
intention and that the boards
 
03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
that the executive director would only
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
be administering the board in
 
03:08:16.710 --> 03:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
consultation with the practitioners who
 
03:08:19.429 --> 03:08:19.439 align:start position:0%
have the technical skill knowledge and
 
03:08:19.439 --> 03:08:20.550 align:start position:0%
have the technical skill knowledge and
experience

03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
experience
 
03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:08:24.389 --> 03:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
one of the things we certainly have
 
03:08:26.950 --> 03:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
established in this process is there's a
 
03:08:28.870 --> 03:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
lot of public support
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
for midwives
 
03:08:34.950 --> 03:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i i i rarely get such an inundation
 
03:08:40.309 --> 03:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
of uh emails in support of a profession
 
03:08:43.429 --> 03:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
even if very often was the same language
 
03:08:43.439 --> 03:08:44.630 align:start position:0%
even if very often was the same language
so

03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:08:46.710 --> 03:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
people don't have to write it in their
 
03:08:49.349 --> 03:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
own language they were very manifest in
 
03:08:51.110 --> 03:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
their intentions so if there are any
 
03:08:52.870 --> 03:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
questions i'd be happy to
 
03:08:55.750 --> 03:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
answer them otherwise i i look forward
 
03:08:57.910 --> 03:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
to hearing the testimony from the
 
03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
assembly representative scitec
 
03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt is the public
 
03:09:04.469 --> 03:09:04.479 align:start position:0%

meetings
 
03:09:08.550 --> 03:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
so the public is not only invited but
 
03:09:11.590 --> 03:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
they are entitled uh to attend
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%

and the public is welcomed and invited

that we benefit from what they can tell
 
03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
us from their own experience
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%

i'll be very brief
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor of the bill i became
 
03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:01.110 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor of the bill i became
aware

03:10:01.110 --> 03:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
aware
 
03:10:03.349 --> 03:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
shortly after it was introduced that
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of deficiencies in it
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
among them
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
the membership and makeup of the board
 
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
i have had an amendment drafted
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
which restores the
 
03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
five of the members of the board it
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
deletes the public member
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
and re-adds the qualifications of the
 
03:10:24.229 --> 03:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
two physicians
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
that are currently in statute
 
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
i would also say that we probably will
 
03:10:31.910 --> 03:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
be interested in
 
03:10:34.750 --> 03:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
amending the bill to add that phrase in
 
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
consultation with
 
03:10:38.950 --> 03:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
however i understand there's a large
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
push most of the folks present here
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
probably would like to see the bill
 
03:10:43.359 --> 03:10:44.389 align:start position:0%
probably would like to see the bill
killed

03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
killed
 
03:10:45.910 --> 03:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
if that happens
 
03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
if that's the opinion of the committee
 
03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
fine otherwise i have this amendment
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
03:10:51.359 --> 03:10:52.710 align:start position:0%
ready to
present

03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
present
 
03:10:57.590 --> 03:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you for your
 
03:11:11.590 --> 03:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's on yeah
 
03:11:15.030 --> 03:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh i'm
 
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative jess edwards representing
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
auburn chester and sandown
 
03:11:19.439 --> 03:11:21.110 align:start position:0%
auburn chester and sandown
um

03:11:21.110 --> 03:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
24 hours ago i didn't know this bill was
 
03:11:26.150 --> 03:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
coming to committee so i do not have
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
any uh much technical guidance to to
 
03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
share with you
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
but uh i did get a lot of calls last
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
night and i learned
 
03:11:37.830 --> 03:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
how to pronounce midwifery so
 
03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
so that was a big deal for me uh
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
i i would say
 
03:11:45.910 --> 03:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
some of the public testimony you hear i
 
03:11:48.070 --> 03:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
think will be cautioned by just wanting
 
03:11:50.309 --> 03:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
to be polite and a little intimidated by
 
03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
the hearing process
 
03:11:54.070 --> 03:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
and so you may not pick up on what i
 
03:11:56.229 --> 03:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
picked up on and that is that there's a
 
03:11:59.110 --> 03:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
palpable fear that this is uh an end
 
03:12:01.590 --> 03:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
round a trick to start to figure out how
 
03:12:04.630 --> 03:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
to kill the practice of midwives in new
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i've talked to um
 
03:12:10.150 --> 03:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor um representative
 
03:12:11.590 --> 03:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
mcguire i don't believe that's her
 
03:12:13.830 --> 03:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
intent at all but i did want to let you
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
all know that
 
03:12:18.150 --> 03:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
there is that sort of fear uh
 
03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
in this community uh one thing i i heard
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
that uh y'all are in a good position to
 
03:12:24.239 --> 03:12:25.429 align:start position:0%
that uh y'all are in a good position to
evaluate

03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:25.439 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
03:12:28.550 --> 03:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
is that in the membership um
 
03:12:30.309 --> 03:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
they they thought
 
03:12:32.389 --> 03:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
the participation of
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
practicing midwives is underrepresented
 
03:12:38.150 --> 03:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
and apparently there's at least two
 
03:12:40.630 --> 03:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
types of midwives there are hospital
 
03:12:43.910 --> 03:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
midwives and there are in-home midwives
 
03:12:45.990 --> 03:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
and apparently
 
03:12:48.870 --> 03:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
the point of view of each is
 
03:12:52.070 --> 03:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
sufficiently separated that the request
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
was made to me to ask the committee to
 
03:12:54.640 --> 03:12:55.670 align:start position:0%
was made to me to ask the committee to
consider

03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:12:58.630 --> 03:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
having one of each
 
03:13:00.309 --> 03:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
so that's really uh that's really my
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
testimony i i have a lot of faith in
 
03:13:04.229 --> 03:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
tremendous technical work work that i i
 
03:13:09.510 --> 03:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
could never do so i appreciate that you
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
guys are laboring this
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative edwards i also
 
03:13:16.710 --> 03:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
like to take this time to apologize for
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
mispronouncing midwifery at the very
 
03:13:21.670 --> 03:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
beginning of this hearing
 
03:13:23.670 --> 03:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
quickly realized my mistake are there
 
03:13:26.389 --> 03:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
03:13:27.670 --> 03:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
03:13:27.680 --> 03:13:30.950 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
edwards

03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
mr lemieux
 
03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:46.630 --> 03:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay
 
03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:48.870 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay
um

03:13:48.870 --> 03:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:51.110 --> 03:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
oh perfect
 
03:13:52.790 --> 03:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
perfect usually i speak without a
 
03:13:56.469 --> 03:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
microphone um david larue um i currently
 
03:13:59.429 --> 03:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
have a child on the way with a midwife
 
03:14:02.550 --> 03:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't want it any other way
 
03:14:05.110 --> 03:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
you're darn right there's a lot of fear
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have the technical aspects to
 
03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
speak about the midwife profession i'm
 
03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
not registered i'm not a midwife
 
03:14:15.030 --> 03:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
but i trust them
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
live free or die
 
03:14:18.550 --> 03:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
i have to constantly say this phrase
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
when i speak to councils and committees
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
and people on the street
 
03:14:22.319 --> 03:14:23.429 align:start position:0%
and people on the street
and

03:14:23.429 --> 03:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
it seems that we've forgotten really
 
03:14:27.269 --> 03:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
what that means again
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
how can we live free in new hampshire
 
03:14:30.870 --> 03:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
how can we live free if we're not able
 
03:14:32.950 --> 03:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be born free
 
03:14:35.349 --> 03:14:35.359 align:start position:0%
okay you can't live a way that you can't
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
start and we already have a lot of
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
problems with our society and with our
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
system where our children who we entrust
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
these midwives to bring into the world
 
03:14:47.429 --> 03:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
are born into a highly regulated
 
03:14:50.150 --> 03:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
and not free society
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
and the question that was asked right
 
03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
away why is the count the this new
 
03:14:57.429 --> 03:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
council being made up not primarily of
 
03:14:57.439 --> 03:14:58.710 align:start position:0%
council being made up not primarily of
midwives

03:14:58.710 --> 03:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
midwives
 
03:15:00.710 --> 03:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
that that is a great point and that's
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:03.680 --> 03:15:04.469 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:15:04.469 --> 03:15:04.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:06.790 --> 03:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
from the sponsor of the bill it sounds
 
03:15:08.229 --> 03:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
like this was
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
not the midwife organization in the
 
03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
profession coming and saying hey we need
 
03:15:14.950 --> 03:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
some help this was an outside
 
03:15:17.349 --> 03:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
organization said hey those little guys
 
03:15:19.030 --> 03:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
need some help because they're screw-ups
 
03:15:20.710 --> 03:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
and we can really help them because they
 
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what they're doing and so now
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
we have this
 
03:15:25.990 --> 03:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it used to be
 
03:15:28.070 --> 03:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
used to be kind of a badge of honor you
 
03:15:29.429 --> 03:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
know i'm hearing my coveralls and my
 
03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
rubber boots and i'm from the country
 
03:15:31.680 --> 03:15:32.790 align:start position:0%
rubber boots and i'm from the country
and

03:15:32.790 --> 03:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:15:34.389 --> 03:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know the old-timers up north we
 
03:15:36.710 --> 03:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
always used to hear oh yeah that guy he
 
03:15:39.349 --> 03:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
was born in that house yeah grandpa he
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
lived and died in that house he they
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
died in the house that grandpa built we
 
03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
used to have traditions we used to have
 
03:15:46.710 --> 03:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
history we used to have legacy and in
 
03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
new england we used to really have some
 
03:15:52.710 --> 03:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about legacy here and what
 
03:15:57.269 --> 03:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
legacy does the midwife
 
03:16:02.070 --> 03:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
the midwife leave what is their part um
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
we don't arrive at a stranglehold of
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
tyranny via a decisive action we don't
 
03:16:09.990 --> 03:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
arrive at an industry being a shell of
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
themselves and a profession being
 
03:16:13.910 --> 03:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
hollowed out and losing all that makes
 
03:16:15.670 --> 03:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
them special we don't arrive at that
 
03:16:17.670 --> 03:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
overnight through one bill
 
03:16:19.990 --> 03:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's the death of a thousand paper cuts
 
03:16:23.429 --> 03:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
and people are right to be um in fear of
 
03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
bills especially poorly constructed ones
 
03:16:28.229 --> 03:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
with good intentions
 
03:16:30.469 --> 03:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
we hear every single bill no matter what
 
03:16:31.750 --> 03:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
it is well it was made with good
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
intentions well i can tell you which
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%

road to wear is paved with good
intentions

03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
intentions
 
03:16:39.510 --> 03:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals and the birthing industry is
 
03:16:40.790 --> 03:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
big money
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't have to identify the
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
elephant in the room to say that we have
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
some serious issues in our medical field
 
03:16:49.830 --> 03:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
and with people worrying about hospital
 
03:16:51.990 --> 03:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
care right now worrying about what
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to receive what their
 
03:16:55.830 --> 03:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
babies are going to receive
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
um it's the hospitals are our faceless
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
industry for the most part midwives are
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
an intimate experience
 
03:17:03.670 --> 03:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
you don't get the relationship with the
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
hospital i don't care how many times you
 
03:17:07.349 --> 03:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
see your doctor you do not develop the
 
03:17:09.830 --> 03:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
trust and um
 
03:17:12.150 --> 03:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
the you do not get to test the knowledge
 
03:17:13.910 --> 03:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
of the physician and the team that's
 
03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to be helping bring your child
 
03:17:17.269 --> 03:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
into the world through the hospital
 
03:17:25.269 --> 03:17:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:27.269 --> 03:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
i definitely think this needs
 
03:17:28.469 --> 03:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
more work
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
i would vote against it i would say it
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
needs to go back to the drawing board or
 
03:17:33.269 --> 03:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
be scrapped
 
03:17:36.550 --> 03:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
um and you guys need to let alone what
 
03:17:41.830 --> 03:17:41.840 align:start position:0%

and
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
i certainly would never impute um bad
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
intentions towards
 
03:18:46.389 --> 03:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
the people who drafted this bill
 
03:18:48.229 --> 03:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
but reading it i read it yesterday for
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
the first time and it was clear it was
 
03:18:50.720 --> 03:18:52.710 align:start position:0%
the first time and it was clear it was
either

03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:18:54.630 --> 03:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
no no thought went into it whatsoever
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
because i was extremely alarmed when i
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
read it um
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
it read as a clear desire to
 
03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
take over the practice of midwifery take
 
03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
the decision making out of their hands
 
03:19:06.960 --> 03:19:10.550 align:start position:0%
the decision making out of their hands
um

03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
as an attorney we have professional
 
03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
boards that govern our
 
03:19:15.040 --> 03:19:17.269 align:start position:0%
boards that govern our
licensure

03:19:17.269 --> 03:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
03:19:19.269 --> 03:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
in our conduct and if you were to tell
 
03:19:21.110 --> 03:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
me that you wanted to put a midwife in
 
03:19:23.830 --> 03:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
charge of that i would say you're crazy
 
03:19:23.840 --> 03:19:25.349 align:start position:0%
charge of that i would say you're crazy
um

03:19:25.349 --> 03:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
i think this similar thing applies i
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
don't see any good reason
 
03:19:32.150 --> 03:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
to give the executive director and
 
03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:33.429 align:start position:0%
to give the executive director and
attorney

03:19:33.429 --> 03:19:33.439 align:start position:0%

i am a student midwife currently
 
03:20:14.950 --> 03:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
completing the pep process to become a
 
03:20:17.349 --> 03:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
cpm in the state of new hampshire and i
 
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
am also a doula running sacred sunshine
 
03:20:23.190 --> 03:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
birth in keene new hampshire
 
03:20:24.870 --> 03:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
as this bill stands without any
 
03:20:24.880 --> 03:20:26.389 align:start position:0%
as this bill stands without any
amendments

03:20:26.389 --> 03:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
03:20:28.710 --> 03:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
it threatens the autonomy of midwives in
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
03:20:33.670 --> 03:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
truthfully home birth and midwifery
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is already too
 
03:20:35.439 --> 03:20:36.870 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire is already too
regulated

03:20:36.870 --> 03:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
03:20:39.429 --> 03:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
home birth needs to become more free
 
03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:45.269 --> 03:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
midwifery being under attack is nothing
 
03:20:46.790 --> 03:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
new honestly
 
03:20:49.269 --> 03:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
for the past hundred years or so
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
the over medicalization of the natural
 
03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
process of birth
 
03:20:55.110 --> 03:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
has pushed midwives out of the birth
 
03:20:55.120 --> 03:20:56.550 align:start position:0%
has pushed midwives out of the birth
process

03:20:56.550 --> 03:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:20:58.469 --> 03:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
so you can understand why we are
 
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
fiercely against this bill as it stands
 
03:21:03.269 --> 03:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
without amendments
 
03:21:06.229 --> 03:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
i fear that this bill as many all many
 
03:21:08.309 --> 03:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
others have also stated that they also
 
03:21:08.319 --> 03:21:09.269 align:start position:0%
others have also stated that they also
fear

03:21:09.269 --> 03:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
fear
 
03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
that this bill will take autonomy away
 
03:21:16.150 --> 03:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
our neighboring new england states of
 
03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and connecticut no offense
 
03:21:23.190 --> 03:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
put us to shame
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
as far as birth freedom
 
03:21:29.030 --> 03:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
women's rights regarding birth goes
 
03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
i would like to see amendments to this
 
03:21:32.630 --> 03:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill removing some of the state's
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions and regulations that we
 
03:21:36.710 --> 03:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
already have on home birth i'm not sure
 
03:21:39.190 --> 03:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
if that's possible as far as this bill
 
03:21:40.710 --> 03:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
is concerned
 
03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
but to start we absolutely need to
 
03:21:42.319 --> 03:21:43.429 align:start position:0%
but to start we absolutely need to
remove

03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
remove
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions like bmi
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
not allowing vaginal births after
 
03:21:51.349 --> 03:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
cesarean after two cesareans
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
in other states these are allowed in the
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
home birth setting but for some reason
 
03:21:59.670 --> 03:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire they are not
 
03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:22:04.830 --> 03:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
vaginal birth after two
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
cesareans an elective c-section before
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
spontaneous onset of labor increases
 
03:22:13.510 --> 03:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
risk of maternal mortality two to four
 
03:22:16.550 --> 03:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
times compared to vaginal birth without
 
03:22:16.560 --> 03:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
times compared to vaginal birth without
induction

03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
induction
 
03:22:19.670 --> 03:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
meaning that actually it is more
 
03:22:19.680 --> 03:22:20.389 align:start position:0%
meaning that actually it is more
dangerous

03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
03:22:22.870 --> 03:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
to give birth in the hospital with an
 
03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
elective c-section than it is to give
 
03:22:28.389 --> 03:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
birth at home with an at-home midwife
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
in cases of v back mothers
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
six per a thousand
 
03:22:34.479 --> 03:22:35.269 align:start position:0%
six per a thousand
um

03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:38.469 --> 03:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
maternal mortalities were with
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
home births in a hundred per one hundred
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
thousand were in the hospital with
 
03:22:45.349 --> 03:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
repeat cesareans so
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
those numbers are also coming from the
 
03:22:53.190 --> 03:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
mana the cdc and the nih in the c the
 
03:22:53.200 --> 03:22:56.309 align:start position:0%
mana the cdc and the nih in the c the
ncbi

03:22:56.309 --> 03:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:58.150 --> 03:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
breach delivery in twins can also be
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
safely delivered at home this is allowed
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
in many other states including
 
03:23:03.110 --> 03:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts but for some reason it is
 
03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
midwives know how to assist women in
 
03:23:11.269 --> 03:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
birthing their babies in a kind gentle
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
loving and safe way
 
03:23:15.990 --> 03:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
midwives deserve the autonomy to make
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
the important decisions regarding
 
03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:18.950 align:start position:0%
the important decisions regarding
midwifery

03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
midwifery
 
03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
again like some other people have
 
03:23:22.389 --> 03:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
already stated it doesn't make sense to
 
03:23:24.389 --> 03:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
put people that are not midwives in
 
03:23:26.469 --> 03:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
charge of the midwifery boards we don't
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
tell obstetricians how to do their job
 
03:23:30.550 --> 03:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
so why are they telling us how to do our
 
03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:31.830 align:start position:0%
so why are they telling us how to do our
job

03:23:31.830 --> 03:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
job
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals obs nurses and even yes most
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
certified nurse midwives don't speak the
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
language of home birth or natural
 
03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:40.229 align:start position:0%
language of home birth or natural
childbirth

03:23:40.229 --> 03:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
childbirth
 
03:23:42.469 --> 03:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous to have non-midwives
 
03:23:44.550 --> 03:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
outnumber midwives on a midwifery
 
03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:48.309 align:start position:0%
outnumber midwives on a midwifery
council

03:23:48.309 --> 03:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
so again i urge you to amend this bill
 
03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
or completely throw it out
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
to give midwives the autonomy they
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
deserve and to also remove
 
03:23:58.710 --> 03:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
discriminatory regulations from home
 
03:23:58.720 --> 03:24:00.070 align:start position:0%
discriminatory regulations from home
birth

03:24:00.070 --> 03:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
birth
 
03:24:01.510 --> 03:24:01.520 align:start position:0%

and i am coming to you today on behalf
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire midwives
 
03:25:20.229 --> 03:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
association this is an official document
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
from our president
 
03:25:27.030 --> 03:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm just going to read that
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
the board of directors of the new
 
03:25:30.550 --> 03:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire midwives association on behalf
 
03:25:32.950 --> 03:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
of our members strongly opposes the
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:40.389 --> 03:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
as currently drafted by the executive
 
03:25:43.030 --> 03:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
departments and administrators
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
we have concerns that administering the
 
03:25:47.830 --> 03:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
powers and duties to a sole entity the
 
03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:48.830 align:start position:0%
powers and duties to a sole entity the
executive

03:25:48.830 --> 03:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
executive
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
director we will be removing will be
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
removing autonomy
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the ability to remain a
 
03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
self-regulating body as we have for
 
03:26:00.229 --> 03:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
licensed midwifery has a long-standing
 
03:26:04.469 --> 03:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
ability to self-regulate
 
03:26:06.950 --> 03:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
maintain responsibilities and address
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action
 
03:26:11.030 --> 03:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
placing this responsibility on a sole
 
03:26:13.750 --> 03:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
entity as the executive director stands
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
threatens the ability for licensed
 
03:26:18.389 --> 03:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
midwifery to continue on as an
 
03:26:18.399 --> 03:26:20.070 align:start position:0%
midwifery to continue on as an
autonomous

03:26:20.070 --> 03:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
autonomous
 
03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge-based regulatory system
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
as it is impossible for an executive
 
03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
director to have a thorough
 
03:26:28.070 --> 03:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
understanding of the practice and
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
profession without having experience in
 
03:26:30.239 --> 03:26:31.190 align:start position:0%
profession without having experience in
such

03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
such
 
03:26:33.670 --> 03:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
as it stands the midwifery board is made
 
03:26:36.790 --> 03:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
of physicians pediatricians and peers
 
03:26:39.110 --> 03:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
experienced and well-versed in certified
 
03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:40.469 align:start position:0%
experienced and well-versed in certified
midwifery

03:26:40.469 --> 03:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
midwifery
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that rulemaking regulations
 
03:26:46.950 --> 03:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
formalities and disciplinary actions are
 
03:26:49.190 --> 03:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate and adequate to the
 
03:26:51.110 --> 03:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
profession the to the midwifery
 
03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:52.630 align:start position:0%
profession the to the midwifery
profession

03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:26:54.389 --> 03:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
additionally the amendment proposes
 
03:26:56.550 --> 03:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
removing the public member of the
 
03:26:59.030 --> 03:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
council we feel that removing
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
the midwifery consumer from the council
 
03:27:04.150 --> 03:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
silences the voices of the general
 
03:27:04.160 --> 03:27:05.110 align:start position:0%
silences the voices of the general
public

03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:27:08.150 --> 03:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
and as we know the voices are many
 
03:27:10.469 --> 03:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
the midwifery profession has always put
 
03:27:13.030 --> 03:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
consumers public and community interests
 
03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
at the foremost of their works
 
03:27:15.760 --> 03:27:17.190 align:start position:0%
at the foremost of their works
purpose

03:27:17.190 --> 03:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
to remove this position not only has a
 
03:27:20.950 --> 03:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the community we
 
03:27:22.710 --> 03:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
aim to serve but also lessens the
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
integrity and respect of the profession
 
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the regulating body as a whole as
 
03:27:30.229 --> 03:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire midwives association
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
we are asking that this bill be repealed
 
03:27:34.630 --> 03:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
completely and that we continue to
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
remain a self-regulating profession
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
under the guidance and regulation of the
 
03:27:40.790 --> 03:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
current midwifery board
 
03:27:44.710 --> 03:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:50.150 --> 03:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
the uh public person here will be
 
03:27:53.110 --> 03:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
willing to take your question of course
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you may i ask a question madam
 
03:27:57.520 --> 03:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
thank you may i ask a question madam
chair

03:27:59.830 --> 03:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh i i suspect that i know
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
the answer to this question but i would
 
03:28:05.510 --> 03:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
like it to be
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
entered into the record uh we received a
 
03:28:10.790 --> 03:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
communication from oplc concerned about
 
03:28:13.110 --> 03:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
the sherman antitrust act and possible
 
03:28:15.429 --> 03:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive conduct by
 
03:28:17.590 --> 03:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that there are only 27
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
active certified midwives in new
 
03:28:19.520 --> 03:28:20.550 align:start position:0%
active certified midwives in new
hampshire

03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:28:21.990 --> 03:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that
 
03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive behavior tends to raise
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
prices could you explain to us the
 
03:28:28.870 --> 03:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
approximate difference in cost to a
 
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
family of having a home birth with a
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
midwife versus having a hospital birth
 
03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:35.349 align:start position:0%
midwife versus having a hospital birth
well

03:28:35.349 --> 03:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:28:37.590 --> 03:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
from my standpoint i take a sliding
 
03:28:40.469 --> 03:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
scale fee i do not take insurance and i
 
03:28:44.790 --> 03:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
am 3 800 for 11 months worth of care
 
03:28:44.800 --> 03:28:46.469 align:start position:0%
am 3 800 for 11 months worth of care
um

03:28:46.469 --> 03:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:48.150 --> 03:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
and then a hospital i
 
03:28:48.160 --> 03:28:49.670 align:start position:0%
and then a hospital i
believe

03:28:49.670 --> 03:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:28:52.150 --> 03:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
that the hospital for a normal birth
 
03:28:54.309 --> 03:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
with no medication or anything is over
 
03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
nine thousand dollars these days
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%

in new hampshire there are no schools in
 
03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for midwifery how do you
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
learn how do you learn to become a
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
midwife so you go to a accredited school
 
03:29:33.830 --> 03:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
well there's two different paths that
 
03:29:35.670 --> 03:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
you can take but one path is to go to an
 
03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
accredited school
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
there was one in bridgton maine for a
 
03:29:41.269 --> 03:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
long time they have gone out of business
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
but there's other schools in the country
 
03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
that midwives go to and then they
 
03:29:48.150 --> 03:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
our students go to and then they come to
 
03:29:51.110 --> 03:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to do their preceptorship
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
with another midwife
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
and follow under their direction until
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
they have done the amount of births that
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
they need to in order to become a
 
03:29:58.960 --> 03:30:02.630 align:start position:0%
they need to in order to become a
midwife

03:30:02.630 --> 03:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:05.910 --> 03:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
follow up yes uh you
 
03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:06.790 align:start position:0%
follow up yes uh you
meet

03:30:06.790 --> 03:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:30:09.190 --> 03:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
midwife yeah we never have any problem
 
03:30:12.070 --> 03:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
to deliver a baby
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
can you say that again i'm sorry
 
03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
i speak too fast uh if we never have a
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
problem to deliver a baby
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
because you know at the hospital
 
03:30:23.190 --> 03:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
babies that come
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
different way
 
03:30:29.110 --> 03:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
upside down or
 
03:30:31.030 --> 03:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so the practice of midwifery allows
 
03:30:34.229 --> 03:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
us as midwives to follow women um
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
intimately during their prenatal time in
 
03:30:39.190 --> 03:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
order to make sure and
 
03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
to look at their history
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
make sure they are low risk clients that
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
are doing home birth and we we have very
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
clear ruling on all of this of how to
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
determine who is
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable for home birth
 
03:30:55.269 --> 03:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
and not but
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
may i just remind you that home birth is
 
03:30:59.030 --> 03:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
normal and it's been normal for a really
 
03:31:01.750 --> 03:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
really really long time oh okay all
 
03:31:04.750 --> 03:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:04.760 --> 03:31:06.309 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
03:31:13.110 --> 03:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
i'm from the city i'm a little uneasy
 
03:31:17.269 --> 03:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
about midwifery and i don't appreciate
 
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
the education i want to try to open
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
open the mind as representative schmidt
 
03:31:25.269 --> 03:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
might say uh my question is this um
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's allied with uh representative judy
 
03:31:29.830 --> 03:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
what happens if something goes wrong
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
what do you do about it rh
 
03:31:31.200 --> 03:31:33.030 align:start position:0%
what do you do about it rh
incompatibility

03:31:33.030 --> 03:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
incompatibility
 
03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh so we have laws that that we have to
 
03:31:38.710 --> 03:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
follow as midwives in order to
 
03:31:40.150 --> 03:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that our clients are staying
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
low risk at all times and if they're not
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
then that is the wonder and blessing of
 
03:31:48.070 --> 03:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
having a hospital to have them go to
 
03:31:50.070 --> 03:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
if those things happen
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
but the rarity of those things is small
 
03:31:54.630 --> 03:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
in comparison to
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:00.950 --> 03:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i guess yeah
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
03:32:03.520 --> 03:32:04.710 align:start position:0%
representative grota
you

03:32:04.710 --> 03:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:09.110 --> 03:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
um i don't have a question about your
 
03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
profession or its standing or
 
03:32:15.110 --> 03:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
my concern is the board yeah
 
03:32:15.120 --> 03:32:15.910 align:start position:0%
my concern is the board yeah
so

03:32:15.910 --> 03:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:18.150 --> 03:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
when you have an application for a
 
03:32:18.160 --> 03:32:19.830 align:start position:0%
when you have an application for a
licensee

03:32:19.830 --> 03:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
does the board approve that
 
03:32:22.479 --> 03:32:23.670 align:start position:0%
does the board approve that
application

03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:32:26.070 --> 03:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
as far as i know yes it goes to the
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
council right now the midwifery council
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
is who regulates who becomes
 
03:32:33.590 --> 03:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
a midwife in the state and it's done on
 
03:32:35.429 --> 03:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
a number of different criteria that the
 
03:32:37.269 --> 03:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
midwife has to
 
03:32:40.550 --> 03:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
adhere to and that's how we get our
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
re-licensure every year as well i'm not
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the council i am
 
03:32:47.429 --> 03:32:47.439 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of the midwifery
 
03:32:49.349 --> 03:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
association today
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:33:00.389 --> 03:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:00.399 --> 03:33:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
do you understand that the concerns that
 
03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
we have have to do with the board rather
 
03:33:07.040 --> 03:33:08.389 align:start position:0%
we have have to do with the board rather
than

03:33:08.389 --> 03:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
your profession you
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
home births
 
03:33:12.399 --> 03:33:14.070 align:start position:0%
home births
babies

03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
babies
 
03:33:14.080 --> 03:33:15.590 align:start position:0%
babies
um

03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:19.670 --> 03:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
the board has certain functions that it
 
03:33:23.670 --> 03:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
and if it does not meet those
 
03:33:25.439 --> 03:33:27.349 align:start position:0%
and if it does not meet those
requirements

03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:33:27.359 --> 03:33:29.110 align:start position:0%
requirements
then

03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:33:31.349 --> 03:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
things that could affect you
 
03:33:32.469 --> 03:33:32.479 align:start position:0%
as a group
 
03:33:34.630 --> 03:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
could happen do you understand that i
 
03:33:36.550 --> 03:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
understand that i do not think that is
 
03:33:39.830 --> 03:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
accurate i as a midwife in the state i
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%

their job it was more me trying to
 
03:33:58.870 --> 03:33:58.880 align:start position:0%

midwifery association
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
interact with the

so
 
03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
we have a representative from the
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
council that comes to the board to tell
 
03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
us any
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
news that might be happening which is
 
03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
how we found out about this
 
03:35:06.630 --> 03:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
but the midwifery association is
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
is built so that we as midwives can come
 
03:35:13.830 --> 03:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
together and look at how we function as
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
midwives and get information from each
 
03:35:19.110 --> 03:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
other get help from each other
 
03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:21.190 align:start position:0%
other get help from each other
and

03:35:21.190 --> 03:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
really it's best for our communication
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
and our furthering
 
03:35:27.670 --> 03:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you madam
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
in listening to your testimony you said
 
03:35:36.309 --> 03:35:36.319 align:start position:0%
that uh currently there's a member of
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
the public that is on the board
 
03:35:41.830 --> 03:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i perused the bill and you know did
 
03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
the homework and read it but
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
although i don't see it but how would
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
this bill change that public input
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
so as far as i'm con well as far as i
 
03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
know so i'm not speaking on behalf of
 
03:35:55.990 --> 03:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
the council today i'm speaking on just
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of the midwifery association but
 
03:36:00.870 --> 03:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
as far as we were told
 
03:36:00.880 --> 03:36:01.750 align:start position:0%
as far as we were told
you

03:36:01.750 --> 03:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:36:01.760 --> 03:36:02.710 align:start position:0%
you
the

03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
new advisory board that this bill is
 
03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
new advisory board that this bill is
asking

03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
asking
 
03:36:10.630 --> 03:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
to be made up is only of two doctors and
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
a midwife
 
03:36:15.510 --> 03:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
and our current council has three
 
03:36:17.910 --> 03:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
midwives a doctor
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
an ob a pediatrician so two doctors and
 
03:36:23.910 --> 03:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
a member of the public that is our norm
 
03:36:27.190 --> 03:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:28.710 --> 03:36:28.720 align:start position:0%

just to comment on that representative
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
the bill replaces the current makeup of
 
03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
the council so the existing makeup you'd
 
03:36:42.950 --> 03:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
have to go look at the existing rsa
 
03:36:47.670 --> 03:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:50.469 --> 03:36:50.479 align:start position:0%

the enabling legislation for the

03:37:55.760 --> 03:37:57.110 align:start position:0%
certification of midwives in new

03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
chapter 326d states
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
and this is i quote
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of the general court to
 
03:38:05.510 --> 03:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
preserve the right of women to deliver
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
at home
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
to remove obstacles to safe out of
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
hospital deliveries and to assure
 
03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
quality a care
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
the bill established the midwifery
 
03:38:17.990 --> 03:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
council with powers and duties to
 
03:38:19.910 --> 03:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
certify midwives to investigate
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
complaints and undertake disciplinary
 
03:38:22.000 --> 03:38:23.190 align:start position:0%
complaints and undertake disciplinary
action

03:38:23.190 --> 03:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
action
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
in addition the midwifery council is
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
charged with rulemaking for midwives
 
03:38:27.840 --> 03:38:29.590 align:start position:0%
charged with rulemaking for midwives
qualifications

03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
scope of practice and policies for
 
03:38:35.429 --> 03:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
professional direction and supervision
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
and as been
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
spoken about several times already the
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
composition of the midwifery council is
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
three certified midwives an obstetrician
 
03:38:47.429 --> 03:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
myself a pediatrician and a community
 
03:38:47.439 --> 03:38:50.150 align:start position:0%
myself a pediatrician and a community
member

03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
lindsay courtney the executive director
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
of oplc met with the midwifery council
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
to explain that her goal in putting
 
03:38:59.910 --> 03:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
forth house bills 1061 was to protect
 
03:39:02.550 --> 03:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
against allegations of anti-competitive
 
03:39:05.189 --> 03:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
decisions by the midwifery council which
 
03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
we agree is a laudable goal if i
 
03:39:09.910 --> 03:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
misrepresent what she explained to us
 
03:39:12.630 --> 03:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sure she will correct you correct me
 
03:39:15.189 --> 03:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
um it is in the interest of the oplc and
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
the state's interest that the midwifery
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
council not run afoul of the ftc's
 
03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
commission or the ftc act by acting
 
03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:24.710 align:start position:0%
commission or the ftc act by acting
anti-competitively

03:39:24.710 --> 03:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
anti-competitively
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
so here are the problems that i see with
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
first the executive director of oplc
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be given all power and authority
 
03:39:37.510 --> 03:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
over the profession and practice of
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
midwifery in new hampshire
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
so it's absolutely appropriate that the
 
03:39:44.469 --> 03:39:44.479 align:start position:0%
oplc be headed by someone expert in the
 
03:39:47.110 --> 03:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
legal and administrative aspects
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
of licensure and certification
 
03:39:50.469 --> 03:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
absolutely appropriate
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it's also appropriate for the oplc
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
to monitor and guide the various boards
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
and councils to remain within legal
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
guardrails that's not my area of
 
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
expertise and they will tell you
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
i can get into trouble in terms of the
 
03:40:06.309 --> 03:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
legal part i need that advice and
 
03:40:09.269 --> 03:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
counsel to stay in legal guardrails
 
03:40:11.110 --> 03:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
but it is not realistic that an
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
executive director of oplc would have
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
the expertise
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
in the qualifications to practice
 
03:40:18.150 --> 03:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
midwifery the scope of midwifery
 
03:40:19.990 --> 03:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
practice and evaluating the competence
 
03:40:22.950 --> 03:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
or deviations from midwifery standards
 
03:40:26.469 --> 03:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
and yet house bill 1061 as it's as it's
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
submitted to to to you all
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
places all authority in the hands of the
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
executive director of the oplc
 
03:40:36.150 --> 03:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
the midwifery advisory council as
 
03:40:38.229 --> 03:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
outlined in the proposed legislation
 
03:40:40.950 --> 03:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
would be unable to fulfill the mandates
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the enabling legislation
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
one might argue that house bill 1061
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
ensures appropriate input by the
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
executive director by retaining
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
an advisory council
 
03:40:55.670 --> 03:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
but it would be composed of just one
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
midwife and two other members physicians
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
or aprns with experience in obstetrics
 
03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
an advisory council is problematic for
 
03:41:07.189 --> 03:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
three reasons
 
03:41:08.950 --> 03:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
midwifery also involves care of the
 
03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
newborn the perinatal period there was
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
no provision in the bill
 
03:41:15.110 --> 03:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
for input from a pediatric health care
 
03:41:15.120 --> 03:41:16.710 align:start position:0%
for input from a pediatric health care
provider

03:41:16.710 --> 03:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:41:18.229 --> 03:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
two the history of medicine and
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
midwifery in united states has been
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
less than smooth
 
03:41:26.710 --> 03:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh allopathic medicine my profession has
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
traditionally been his hostile to
 
03:41:30.070 --> 03:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
midwifery and that's been
 
03:41:33.349 --> 03:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
the truth for about 140 years
 
03:41:36.389 --> 03:41:36.399 align:start position:0%
and few obstetricians have any knowledge
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
or direct experience with community
 
03:41:38.000 --> 03:41:39.670 align:start position:0%
or direct experience with community
midwives

03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
midwives
 
03:41:41.990 --> 03:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
the state and oplc would be open to new
 
03:41:44.790 --> 03:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
charges of anti-competitive behavior if
 
03:41:47.030 --> 03:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
a physician dominant advisory council
 
03:41:49.030 --> 03:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
attempted to curtail the practice submit
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
with midwifery
 
03:41:51.439 --> 03:41:52.309 align:start position:0%
with midwifery
three

03:41:52.309 --> 03:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:41:56.070 --> 03:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 1061 functionally obliterates
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
the professional autonomy of midwives in
 
03:41:59.830 --> 03:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire by having only one midwife
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
as the sole voice influencing the
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:09.990 --> 03:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
there is draft legislation that was
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
brought to the midwifery council at our
 
03:42:14.070 --> 03:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
last meeting oplc draft legislation
 
03:42:17.189 --> 03:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
dated 1-22 the amendment
 
03:42:18.870 --> 03:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
is not on the general court bill status
 
03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
website so i won't be able to address it
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
specifically here
 
03:42:25.110 --> 03:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire referenced it
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
but it again it remains problematic
 
03:42:31.189 --> 03:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
because it imbues too much clinical
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
guidance and authority
 
03:42:34.469 --> 03:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:42:36.150 --> 03:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
or whatever the
 
03:42:44.309 --> 03:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
credentials are of the oplc director in
 
03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:49.110 --> 03:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
legislators i stand before you committed
 
03:42:51.269 --> 03:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
to fulfilling the mandate of chapter
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
326d on midwifery to remove obstacles to
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
safe out of hospital deliveries and
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
assure quality of care quality care
 
03:43:01.110 --> 03:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
i oppose house bill 1061 and urge you to
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
reject it
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to work with the oplc
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
and legislators to shape a more
 
03:43:07.830 --> 03:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
acceptable bill
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for me
 
03:43:14.229 --> 03:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative marsh

03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
i have two questions my first question
 
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
is would you believe that i am very
 
03:43:23.110 --> 03:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
happy that i'm not the only licensed
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
physician in this room that chose home
 
03:43:24.880 --> 03:43:26.950 align:start position:0%

birth
 
03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
my second question is more pertinent and
 
03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
it regards your role on the council has
 
03:43:34.389 --> 03:43:34.399 align:start position:0%
the council had any troubles obtaining a
 
03:43:36.630 --> 03:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
quorum and doing its business
 
03:43:40.150 --> 03:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh we've had an illness recently that
 
03:43:41.910 --> 03:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
altered our quorum ability to meet
 
03:43:43.349 --> 03:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
quorum but
 
03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
no generally i've been on the council
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
like i said since 2018.
 
03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%

03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
as i know
 
03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%

okay
 
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
again i'm sherry stevens i live in
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
meredith new hampshire and i'm here as a
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start with a question
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
i have a statement written by the
 
03:45:23.189 --> 03:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
council that i think you all were given
 
03:45:25.269 --> 03:45:25.279 align:start position:0%
would you like me to read that or would
 
03:45:27.670 --> 03:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
you like me to just
 
03:45:27.680 --> 03:45:29.189 align:start position:0%
you like me to just
speak

03:45:29.189 --> 03:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
speak
 
03:45:31.189 --> 03:45:31.199 align:start position:0%
if we've already received that
 
03:45:38.950 --> 03:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.150 --> 03:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to assume that you have
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:45.110 --> 03:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for every member in the
 
03:45:46.630 --> 03:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
room but i do believe most of us have
 
03:45:48.389 --> 03:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
read the emails that were sent over to
 
03:45:50.309 --> 03:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
us thank you okay
 
03:45:52.950 --> 03:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
the basic gist is that the new hampshire
 
03:45:55.359 --> 03:45:56.950 align:start position:0%
the basic gist is that the new hampshire
midwifery

03:45:56.950 --> 03:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
midwifery
 
03:45:59.510 --> 03:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
council is an opposition of this bill
 
03:45:59.520 --> 03:46:00.469 align:start position:0%
council is an opposition of this bill
for

03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
the reasons that have been stated
 
03:46:04.229 --> 03:46:04.239 align:start position:0%
previous so i do
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
not want to
 
03:46:07.110 --> 03:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
dwell on that
 
03:46:09.910 --> 03:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
answers that we've come up with with the
 
03:46:12.640 --> 03:46:13.590 align:start position:0%
answers that we've come up with with the
question

03:46:13.590 --> 03:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:46:13.600 --> 03:46:14.630 align:start position:0%
question
is

03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
are we as the new hampshire midwifery
 
03:46:17.279 --> 03:46:19.189 align:start position:0%
are we as the new hampshire midwifery
council

03:46:19.189 --> 03:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
council
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
at risk for being sued or doing
 
03:46:21.600 --> 03:46:22.469 align:start position:0%
at risk for being sued or doing
something

03:46:22.469 --> 03:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:46:24.790 --> 03:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
untoward with not being administrative
 
03:46:24.800 --> 03:46:26.070 align:start position:0%
untoward with not being administrative
rule

03:46:26.070 --> 03:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
rule
 
03:46:26.080 --> 03:46:27.189 align:start position:0%
rule
um

03:46:27.189 --> 03:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:27.199 --> 03:46:28.469 align:start position:0%
um
professionals

03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
so our
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
stand is that we would like to keep the
 
03:46:35.429 --> 03:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
nehesh midwifery council
 
03:46:37.830 --> 03:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
of three new hampshire midwives
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
with one obstetrician that is
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with the practice of midwifery
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
and one pediatrician that is familiar
 
03:46:48.830 --> 03:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
with the practice of midwifery and the
 
03:46:51.750 --> 03:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
um public member we believe that voice
 
03:46:54.150 --> 03:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
is very important
 
03:46:58.150 --> 03:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
we understand the concerns of the oplc
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
and our way of
 
03:47:03.030 --> 03:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
addressing that is that
 
03:47:04.630 --> 03:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
um in order to preserve i'm going to
 
03:47:06.150 --> 03:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
read this statement in order to preserve
 
03:47:07.349 --> 03:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
the professional autonomy of the
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
midwifery council and to achieve the
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
goal of functioning within the legal
 
03:47:12.870 --> 03:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
barriers we would endorse amending the
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
language in this proposal legislation to
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
reflect that the midwifery council
 
03:47:19.830 --> 03:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
continues to act autonomously with a
 
03:47:22.550 --> 03:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
consultation of the executive director
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
of oplc
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
and that everything that we do
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
we would ask for the
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
consultation of the executive director
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
or her designee therefore we have the
 
03:47:34.870 --> 03:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
oversight that we think that they're
 
03:47:34.880 --> 03:47:35.910 align:start position:0%
oversight that we think that they're
seeking

03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
i did want to
 
03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
go back and address one of the
 
03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
questions i think that were given to
 
03:47:52.229 --> 03:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
ms champney that on rh negative so in
 
03:47:52.239 --> 03:47:53.830 align:start position:0%
ms champney that on rh negative so in
our

03:47:53.830 --> 03:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:47:56.150 --> 03:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
if you have an arch negative mother the
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
concern is that she would
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
have an rh positive baby and and have
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
antibodies built up in her blood and so
 
03:48:07.269 --> 03:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
in our formulary we have the ability to
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
obtain rhogam and
 
03:48:11.670 --> 03:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
administer rogam to the mother so an
 
03:48:13.349 --> 03:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
irish negative mother would be offered
 
03:48:16.150 --> 03:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
that at her 28 week prenatal visit as
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
well as
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
obtain cord blood and decide if the baby
 
03:48:21.670 --> 03:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
or determine if the baby is
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
rh positive and offer the mother a rogue
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
game shot
 
03:48:27.189 --> 03:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
does that answer so i just want to make
 
03:48:30.150 --> 03:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
sure that we we have a formulary in our
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
law in rh
 
03:48:33.670 --> 03:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
our rsa
 
03:48:33.680 --> 03:48:35.429 align:start position:0%
our rsa
326d

03:48:35.429 --> 03:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
326d
 
03:48:37.830 --> 03:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
that gives us a formulary to address
 
03:48:39.030 --> 03:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that were mentioned what
 
03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
happens if there's something wrong we
 
03:48:44.710 --> 03:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
are able to
 
03:48:44.720 --> 03:48:45.910 align:start position:0%
are able to
administer

03:48:45.910 --> 03:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
administer
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
medications to
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
help stem a hemorrhage we are able to
 
03:48:50.560 --> 03:48:52.070 align:start position:0%
help stem a hemorrhage we are able to
administrate

03:48:52.070 --> 03:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
administrate
 
03:48:54.309 --> 03:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
rhogam for an rh negative mom if
 
03:48:54.319 --> 03:48:55.990 align:start position:0%
rhogam for an rh negative mom if
necessary

03:48:55.990 --> 03:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
we are also part of we one of the things
 
03:49:01.910 --> 03:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
that was brought up is what is our
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
certification process and one of the
 
03:49:05.750 --> 03:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
certification processes and the
 
03:49:07.750 --> 03:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
recertification process is that we all
 
03:49:10.150 --> 03:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
are certified in cpr and neonatal
 
03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
resuscitation so there
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:19.830 --> 03:49:19.840 align:start position:0%

point of view you are the vital part of
 
03:49:33.189 --> 03:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
this process
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
the public
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
so um i just want to pre i just want you

your efforts and your strength to come
 
03:49:42.160 --> 03:49:42.950 align:start position:0%
your efforts and your strength to come
here

03:49:42.950 --> 03:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:43.840 --> 03:49:44.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:48.150 --> 03:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
so in if you were to if we were let's
 
03:49:48.160 --> 03:49:48.950 align:start position:0%
so in if you were to if we were let's
just

03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:49:50.830 --> 03:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
talk about this consultation with the
 
03:49:53.990 --> 03:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
oplc director or designee
 
03:49:57.990 --> 03:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
how do you envision that happening
 
03:50:00.150 --> 03:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:50:03.670 --> 03:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
as dr reinhart said the intention of the
 
03:50:03.680 --> 03:50:04.870 align:start position:0%
as dr reinhart said the intention of the
original

03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:50:08.309 --> 03:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
rsa 326d which
 
03:50:08.319 --> 03:50:09.110 align:start position:0%
rsa 326d which
in

03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:50:11.750 --> 03:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
81 was created to establish the
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
profession of midwifery
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
and then in 99 we established the
 
03:50:17.429 --> 03:50:17.439 align:start position:0%
midwifery council
 
03:50:19.429 --> 03:50:19.439 align:start position:0%
and the idea is that the midwifery
 
03:50:21.349 --> 03:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
council likes many other boards in the
 
03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
state has regulatory
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
control and that we would
 
03:50:26.399 --> 03:50:27.349 align:start position:0%
control and that we would
have

03:50:27.349 --> 03:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:50:28.870 --> 03:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
it's a process
 
03:50:30.550 --> 03:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
as most of you know if we have a rule
 
03:50:33.030 --> 03:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
making we speak to the rulemaking
 
03:50:35.429 --> 03:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
authorities from the oplc we worked in
 
03:50:37.990 --> 03:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
connection to them we've done it several
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
times over
 
03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
our rules come up we work with them and
 
03:50:43.830 --> 03:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
then we present it to gelcar and it goes
 
03:50:46.150 --> 03:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
through if we have a law change it would
 
03:50:48.710 --> 03:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
go through the process
 
03:50:51.189 --> 03:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
when we have we so we research we
 
03:50:52.950 --> 03:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
certify and
 
03:50:52.960 --> 03:50:54.150 align:start position:0%
certify and
recertify

03:50:54.150 --> 03:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
recertify
 
03:50:56.150 --> 03:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
midwives constantly
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:50:59.590 --> 03:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
i as the chair of the
 
03:51:01.510 --> 03:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
midwifery council have for many many
 
03:51:04.229 --> 03:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
years receive those applications vetted
 
03:51:04.239 --> 03:51:05.189 align:start position:0%
years receive those applications vetted
them

03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
made sure that they meet all the
 
03:51:08.870 --> 03:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
requirements that are stated in the law
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
and rules
 
03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
and then we
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
would issue that midwife
 
03:51:13.600 --> 03:51:15.349 align:start position:0%
would issue that midwife
certification

03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
certification
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
and when oplc
 
03:51:19.110 --> 03:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
came on board and as we've worked with
 
03:51:21.269 --> 03:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
them we've continually tried to work
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
with them and say
 
03:51:24.389 --> 03:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
here's our process here's what we're
 
03:51:27.030 --> 03:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
doing and they say okay here you have an
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
administrator and we're going to help
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
you with that process
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
they give us an administrator and they
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
help us run our meetings they you know
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
we have if we have an investigation they
 
03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
now have the enforcement
 
03:51:40.790 --> 03:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
part of oplc that we work with and we
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
have been absolutely 100 percent
 
03:51:44.870 --> 03:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
willing to work with them tried
 
03:51:47.189 --> 03:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
everything we can to work with them
 
03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
we have consistently had different
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
people come in as our administrator so
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
like we just get working with one and
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
then a new one comes in and it's just
 
03:51:59.990 --> 03:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
been a difficult process but we're 100
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that process we want it to
 
03:52:04.229 --> 03:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
work we would love our meetings to run i
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
have attended the
 
03:52:10.150 --> 03:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
justice department's
 
03:52:12.150 --> 03:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
training on how to run a meeting how to
 
03:52:16.150 --> 03:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
run an investigation since 2015 and we
 
03:52:18.150 --> 03:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
are absolutely committed to doing our
 
03:52:19.590 --> 03:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
job as
 
03:52:19.600 --> 03:52:20.710 align:start position:0%
job as
as

03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:52:22.630 --> 03:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
purposefully and as legitimate as
 
03:52:22.640 --> 03:52:24.790 align:start position:0%
purposefully and as legitimate as
possible

03:52:24.790 --> 03:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
possible
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
so we have no problem working with the
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
oplc if that is what their
 
03:52:30.080 --> 03:52:31.110 align:start position:0%
oplc if that is what their
um

03:52:31.110 --> 03:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:32.790 --> 03:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
in fact i have that their whole their
 
03:52:34.389 --> 03:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
law was established
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
to give administrative support to the
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
boards and so our
 
03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
law says we have
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
our council to regulate the profession
 
03:52:46.790 --> 03:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
of midwifery and the oplc
 
03:52:48.710 --> 03:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
was created to give the boards that
 
03:52:50.550 --> 03:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
administrative support
 
03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely 100
 
03:52:53.670 --> 03:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
agree with that we were happy to work
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
with them we're not trying to do
 
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
anything outside of that
 
03:52:57.040 --> 03:52:57.750 align:start position:0%
anything outside of that
but

03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has this
 
03:53:01.910 --> 03:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful autonomous board of
 
03:53:04.150 --> 03:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
midwiferies we're very lucky to have
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
that it is not true in all 50 states
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
and so we are the state that most states
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
look to and say this is what we want in
 
03:53:14.309 --> 03:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire being live free or die and
 
03:53:16.150 --> 03:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
being the wonderful state we are has
 
03:53:17.670 --> 03:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
created that and the legislative has
 
03:53:19.830 --> 03:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
been very supportive of midwifery
 
03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:20.950 align:start position:0%
been very supportive of midwifery
profession

03:53:20.950 --> 03:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:53:23.349 --> 03:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
since the 80s so we're very grateful for
 
03:53:23.359 --> 03:53:24.070 align:start position:0%
since the 80s so we're very grateful for
that

03:53:24.070 --> 03:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we're not looking to change that at
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
all and so giving
 
03:53:29.349 --> 03:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
all that
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
all this
 
03:53:32.150 --> 03:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
autonomy to one
 
03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
person at the
 
03:53:36.790 --> 03:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
oplc makes no sense whatsoever
 
03:53:38.469 --> 03:53:38.479 align:start position:0%
if they're concerned about what we're
 
03:53:40.389 --> 03:53:40.399 align:start position:0%
doing then please come into our meetings
 
03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
which they do
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
and anything we do we say hey is this
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
the right way to do it and if we're
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
doing something
 
03:53:49.750 --> 03:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect and correct us please you know
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
we want to stay within the law thank you
 
03:53:54.309 --> 03:53:54.319 align:start position:0%

representative marsh
 
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:54:00.309 --> 03:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
ms stevens for taking my question it's a
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
great pleasure to see you again after
 
03:54:03.510 --> 03:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
all these years i
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate a chance to catch up
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
just to be clear is it the position of
 
03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
the midwifery council that we kill this
 
03:54:13.030 --> 03:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill or do you believe we can amend it
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
in such a way to make it actually be
 
03:54:14.640 --> 03:54:15.910 align:start position:0%
in such a way to make it actually be
useful

03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
useful
 
03:54:15.920 --> 03:54:16.790 align:start position:0%
useful
i

03:54:16.790 --> 03:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
it is the recommendation we kill this
 
03:54:19.199 --> 03:54:20.229 align:start position:0%
it is the recommendation we kill this
bill

03:54:20.229 --> 03:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:54:22.150 --> 03:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:22.160 --> 03:54:23.349 align:start position:0%
thank you
the

03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:54:25.510 --> 03:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensing and
 
03:54:28.150 --> 03:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
certification there
 
03:54:30.790 --> 03:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
created to support the boards
 
03:54:31.750 --> 03:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:54:33.990 --> 03:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
us saying you know even a thing you know
 
03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:35.189 align:start position:0%
us saying you know even a thing you know
we

03:54:35.189 --> 03:54:35.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere in in our law that says the
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
council is
 
03:54:42.309 --> 03:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know supposed to do this or that
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
adding with the consultation of the
 
03:54:46.710 --> 03:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
03:54:48.389 --> 03:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
seems redundant to me because it's
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
already their job to oversee us but we
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
are happy to put that language in if
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to give them
 
03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:55.750 align:start position:0%
that's going to give them
um

03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:57.510 --> 03:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
security that we're not you know then
 
03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're following things correctly
 
03:55:05.510 --> 03:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:55:10.550 --> 03:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how to pronounce this
 
03:55:12.309 --> 03:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
last name so
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:25.510 --> 03:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:36.469 --> 03:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
vice chair rhodes and members of the
 
03:55:40.229 --> 03:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
house executive departments and
 
03:55:42.630 --> 03:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
administrative committee my name is
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
evelyn asa i'm a resident of concord new
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm here today to express my
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 1061.
 
03:55:53.429 --> 03:55:53.439 align:start position:0%
i'm here in my capacity as a private
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
citizen and someone who benefited from
 
03:55:57.590 --> 03:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
the expert midwifery practice in our
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
state in 2014 i gave birth to my
 
03:56:02.710 --> 03:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
daughter sabine at home under the expert
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
care and guidance of two highly skilled
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire certified midwives and
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
their then apprentice
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm also here today because until
 
03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
last month i served as the consumer
 
03:56:15.189 --> 03:56:15.199 align:start position:0%
member of the new hampshire midwifery
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
council a position i was honored to be
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
appointed to and hold for nearly seven
 
03:56:20.239 --> 03:56:21.590 align:start position:0%
appointed to and hold for nearly seven
years

03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
03:56:23.110 --> 03:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's from these two
 
03:56:25.110 --> 03:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
highly informed perspectives that i find
 
03:56:27.830 --> 03:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation unnecessary
 
03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
and frankly disconcerting
 
03:56:31.830 --> 03:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
for three decades the practice of
 
03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
midwifery in new hampshire has been
 
03:56:35.910 --> 03:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
successfully regulated and overseen by
 
03:56:38.309 --> 03:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire midwifery council
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
during my near seven year tenure on the
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
council we went to great lengths to
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
uphold the serious responsibilities of
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
our position
 
03:56:48.870 --> 03:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
at the center of the council's work was
 
03:56:51.269 --> 03:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
and remains an unwavering commitment to
 
03:56:53.670 --> 03:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
the well-being of those eligible
 
03:56:55.990 --> 03:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
to seek a safe alternative to hospital
 
03:56:56.000 --> 03:56:57.269 align:start position:0%
to seek a safe alternative to hospital
birth

03:56:57.269 --> 03:56:57.279 align:start position:0%
birth
 
03:56:59.990 --> 03:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
in recent years the oplc has made a
 
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
concerted effort to better support the
 
03:57:04.550 --> 03:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
work of the midwifery council
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
we leveraged every aspect of it
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
available to us as we carried out our
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
work that support was generally a
 
03:57:14.710 --> 03:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
helpful addition to the expertise of our
 
03:57:16.950 --> 03:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
members of our council though it often
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
brought delays to our processes and
 
03:57:21.990 --> 03:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
procedures sometimes by several months
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
due to constant changeovers in staff
 
03:57:26.710 --> 03:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
staff roles and an overall lack of
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
clarity within oplc about oplc staff
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
roles and processes
 
03:57:34.870 --> 03:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the relationship between
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
the council and the oplc was on the
 
03:57:40.309 --> 03:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
whole a complementary one that allowed
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
our expert council to ensure the highest
 
03:57:45.189 --> 03:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
standards for the practice of midwifery
 
03:57:46.469 --> 03:57:46.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:57:49.030 --> 03:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
and effectively oversee and regulate the
 
03:57:49.040 --> 03:57:50.309 align:start position:0%
and effectively oversee and regulate the
profession

03:57:50.309 --> 03:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
profession
 
03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
hb 1061 was drafted and filed by oplc
 
03:57:56.550 --> 03:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
with no advance notice
 
03:57:59.030 --> 03:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
no input and no opportunity for
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the new hampshire
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
midwifery council
 
03:58:05.110 --> 03:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
it is an ill-informed solution in search
 
03:58:06.389 --> 03:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
of a problem
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
and one that has potential to
 
03:58:10.229 --> 03:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
fundamentally undermine the safe
 
03:58:13.349 --> 03:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
practice of midwifery in our state
 
03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is crafted by oplc proposes
 
03:58:17.590 --> 03:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
for midwifery in new hampshire to no
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
longer be directly regulated and
 
03:58:21.830 --> 03:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
overseen by the council it also omits
 
03:58:23.670 --> 03:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
the public members perspective which
 
03:58:26.469 --> 03:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
we've discussed ad nauseam today
 
03:58:28.229 --> 03:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
so what could go wrong in having the
 
03:58:31.030 --> 03:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
complex history profession of midwifery
 
03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
directly regulated and overseen by
 
03:58:38.309 --> 03:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
furthermore as this proposed bill was
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
introduced without any communication
 
03:58:45.590 --> 03:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
with or guidance from the council itself
 
03:58:48.229 --> 03:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
it is also reasonable to question
 
03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
whether this proposed advisory board
 
03:58:52.710 --> 03:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
would have any meaningful influence over
 
03:58:54.870 --> 03:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
the decision-making and oversight of the
 
03:58:56.950 --> 03:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
so in the simplest terms there's no need
 
03:59:01.830 --> 03:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
for this legislation the new hampshire
 
03:59:03.750 --> 03:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
midwifery council should continue to
 
03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
effectively lead in the direct oversight
 
03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
and regulation of the practice of
 
03:59:11.110 --> 03:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
midwifery in our state as the council
 
03:59:13.990 --> 03:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
has done for 30 years
 
03:59:15.990 --> 03:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
i urge you to vote in expedient to
 
03:59:17.910 --> 03:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislate and of course i welcome your
 
03:59:17.920 --> 03:59:21.990 align:start position:0%
legislate and of course i welcome your
questions

03:59:21.990 --> 03:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:25.590 --> 03:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:27.910 --> 03:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
are you willing to take a question sure
 
03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
um from your experience can can you tell
 
03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
me how the oplc staff
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
interacts with your board
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know are they there at every meeting
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
and what services do they provide yes i
 
03:59:44.229 --> 03:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
can say over those seven years um or
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
almost seven years that relationship has
 
03:59:46.640 --> 03:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
almost seven years that relationship has
changed

03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
changed
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
um largely in a favorable direction
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
so in the last several years we've had a
 
03:59:55.830 --> 03:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
member of their staff present in every
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
one of our meetings
 
04:00:00.630 --> 04:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
taking minutes informing our processes
 
04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
providing us with sample language if we
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
have to issue letters to
 
04:00:07.429 --> 04:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
midwives or otherwise take action
 
04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
so it's been a very helpful relationship
 
04:00:12.229 --> 04:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
as i noted there have been some
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
delays to our process there's you know
 
04:00:16.630 --> 04:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
some lag time oftentimes in
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
implementation of things
 
04:00:20.469 --> 04:00:20.479 align:start position:0%
but it has been a beneficial
 
04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
relationship and frankly i don't see a
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.960 --> 04:00:28.469 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

04:00:28.469 --> 04:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:00:30.309 --> 04:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
and uh just one other thing about your
 
04:00:30.319 --> 04:00:31.590 align:start position:0%
and uh just one other thing about your
meetings

04:00:31.590 --> 04:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
04:00:33.429 --> 04:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
do you feel that
 
04:00:35.590 --> 04:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
being able to hold virtual meetings
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
would be a help or not i think it's
 
04:00:41.269 --> 04:00:41.279 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful particularly as
 
04:00:43.269 --> 04:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
members of the council live all over the
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
state and have considerable drive time
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:13.439 --> 04:01:14.790 align:start position:0%
 
hi

04:01:14.790 --> 04:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
hi
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon i'm coming today with
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
nothing written i'm coming with 40 years
 
04:01:21.750 --> 04:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
of experience
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
as a traditional doula excuse me if you
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
could just state your name for the
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
record julie
 
04:01:34.150 --> 04:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.870 --> 04:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm coming today as a mama of nine
 
04:01:36.880 --> 04:01:37.910 align:start position:0%
and i'm coming today as a mama of nine
babies

04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
babies
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
most home born
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
most of them 10 pounds
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
in my traditional doula work now i said
 
04:01:48.150 --> 04:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
all all mamas need is a mama in the room
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
with them as they're laboring
 
04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
to know that here this mom has had many
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
ten pound babies at home
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
works magic
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm coming with a little bit of i
 
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
said three minutes on my talk time
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
so somebody just kind of tell me but i'm
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
coming today with a little bit of a
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
viewpoint from a home birth mama and
 
04:02:10.950 --> 04:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
from the home front
 
04:02:12.550 --> 04:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
like the young man who spoke about
 
04:02:15.510 --> 04:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
expecting his baby soon
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
along with my nine babies we now have 29
 
04:02:18.479 --> 04:02:19.830 align:start position:0%
along with my nine babies we now have 29
grandbabies

04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
grandbabies
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
and midwives have been catching them and
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
these midwives in new hampshire are
 
04:02:23.920 --> 04:02:25.110 align:start position:0%
these midwives in new hampshire are
magic

04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
magic
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
along with skilled
 
04:02:27.439 --> 04:02:28.750 align:start position:0%
along with skilled
knowledgeable

04:02:28.750 --> 04:02:28.760 align:start position:0%

04:02:28.760 --> 04:02:30.309 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable
experienced

04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
04:02:30.319 --> 04:02:32.469 align:start position:0%
experienced
amazing

04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
amazing
 
04:02:35.830 --> 04:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
not only do they support their mamas
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
they support extended families
 
04:02:38.399 --> 04:02:39.429 align:start position:0%
they support extended families
in

04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of different different situations
 
04:02:44.870 --> 04:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
and always towards a healthier more
 
04:02:44.880 --> 04:02:46.389 align:start position:0%
and always towards a healthier more
independent

04:02:46.389 --> 04:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
independent
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
family life
 
04:02:49.830 --> 04:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm now
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
looking at my grandbabies
 
04:02:53.269 --> 04:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
that are being born
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
with the same midwife that they were
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
born into the hands of now these
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
grandbabies are coming into the same
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
hands and it's just beautiful
 
04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
as i travel around the us of a i've met
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
04:03:06.950 --> 04:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
homebirthing circles a lot of the
 
04:03:06.960 --> 04:03:08.309 align:start position:0%
homebirthing circles a lot of the
midwives

04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
midwives
 
04:03:11.189 --> 04:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
and there is just
 
04:03:11.199 --> 04:03:12.870 align:start position:0%
and there is just
no

04:03:12.870 --> 04:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
substitute for what this state has and
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
the freedom that we have
 
04:03:17.359 --> 04:03:18.630 align:start position:0%
the freedom that we have
and

04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
if i can say one thing about the small
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
number of midwives there are many more
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
student midwives that interact with
 
04:03:27.750 --> 04:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
these midwives
 
04:03:30.070 --> 04:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
that they support
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
and another thing is please let the
 
04:03:35.110 --> 04:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
midwives be midwives
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
with women
 
04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
those long drive times i get that
 
04:03:43.189 --> 04:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
like they don't need extra drive time so
 
04:03:45.830 --> 04:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
if there's anything you can do to help
 
04:03:47.910 --> 04:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
you know simplify that so they have more
 
04:03:47.920 --> 04:03:49.510 align:start position:0%
you know simplify that so they have more
time

04:03:49.510 --> 04:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
anyways so
 
04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
i guess we'll leave it with that if
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
there's any questions i'd be happy
 
04:03:59.189 --> 04:03:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:09.990 --> 04:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
hello my name is sandra holmes i am a
 
04:04:11.910 --> 04:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
resident of manchester new hampshire i
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
have had two children my first was
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
hospital born and my second was at home
 
04:04:28.189 --> 04:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.070 --> 04:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
hb1061-fn robs midwifery oversight from
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
people competent to set the standards of
 
04:04:35.349 --> 04:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
their profession and it puts it into the
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
hands of people not even competent to
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
practice the profession
 
04:04:40.950 --> 04:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
this puts the entire practice of
 
04:04:42.550 --> 04:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
midwifery into the hands of people who
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
know nothing about midwifery and who
 
04:04:46.150 --> 04:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest in the practice
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
ceasing to exist
 
04:04:48.720 --> 04:04:49.830 align:start position:0%
ceasing to exist
changes

04:04:49.830 --> 04:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
to the changing the composition of the
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
midwifery council from midwives and
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
their advisors to doctors and one
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
midwife takes the midwives out of the
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
driver's seat of their own profession
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
taking all the power from the midwifery
 
04:05:03.600 --> 04:05:04.790 align:start position:0%
taking all the power from the midwifery
council

04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
council
 
04:05:06.229 --> 04:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
and placing it into the hands of a
 
04:05:08.229 --> 04:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
single executive director is counter to
 
04:05:09.990 --> 04:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's values
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
powers should be vested widely across a
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
large council not concentrated in the
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
hands of a single person there is no
 
04:05:18.630 --> 04:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
need to change the composition of the
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
eleven months ago while hospitals were
 
04:05:26.309 --> 04:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
only allowing a single support person
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
into the labor and delivery room
 
04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
i gave birth to my daughter in my bed
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
with my husband and my mother with two
 
04:05:34.950 --> 04:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
midwives and my teenage son close at
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
hand able to meet his sister within
 
04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
moments of her birth i would not have
 
04:05:42.150 --> 04:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
while hospitals were forcing mothers and
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
their family member to wear masks
 
04:05:47.750 --> 04:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
through labor and delivery my daughter
 
04:05:49.830 --> 04:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
was born into a room with her parents
 
04:05:52.150 --> 04:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
and brothers and grandmothers unmasked
 
04:05:55.590 --> 04:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
faces as her first sight
 
04:05:56.550 --> 04:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have received that in the
 
04:05:56.560 --> 04:05:59.349 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have received that in the
hospital

04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:06:00.790 --> 04:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
my midwives ensured the health and
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
safety of me and my baby and they were
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
able to whisk us away to a hospital if
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
it became necessary
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
giving birth in this fashion was my
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
choice and my right and it is the right
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%

the passing of hb-1061-fn
 
04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%

my history as a midwife
 
04:07:10.150 --> 04:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
is um
 
04:07:12.150 --> 04:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
starting out in texas
 
04:07:14.229 --> 04:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
i was a midwife there i became a midwife
 
04:07:16.469 --> 04:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
there i was also a midwife for seven
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
years in louisiana
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
served as the president of the louisiana
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
midwives association for two years
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
and then five years ago my family moved
 
04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
up to vermont and i've been a vermont
 
04:07:29.429 --> 04:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
licensed midwife and a new hampshire
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
licensed midwife for five years
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
i come to you today to speak from the
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
perspective of a person a midwife who
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
has practiced under a midwifery advisory
 
04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
council in the state of louisiana
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
midwives in louisiana got licensure in
 
04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
1984 and very quickly after that
 
04:07:48.159 --> 04:07:48.830 align:start position:0%
1984 and very quickly after that
we

04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
were managed by the medic the board of
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
medical examiners with an advisory
 
04:07:54.479 --> 04:07:55.910 align:start position:0%
medical examiners with an advisory
committee

04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
this is how midwife was midwifery was
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
regulated in that state until 1999
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
when um i'm sorry 2012 when the advisory
 
04:08:10.870 --> 04:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee was abolished by governor's
 
04:08:10.880 --> 04:08:12.309 align:start position:0%
committee was abolished by governor's
order

04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
order
 
04:08:12.319 --> 04:08:13.269 align:start position:0%
order
so

04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
when i hear uh representatives coming in
 
04:08:17.910 --> 04:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
and talking about this wasn't the
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill this wasn't the
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
intention wasn't to be an assault on the
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
practice of midwifery in this state
 
04:08:27.429 --> 04:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that you all know that
 
04:08:32.309 --> 04:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
impact of bills and laws trump's
 
04:08:34.870 --> 04:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
intention and ultimately what is written
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
in the law and what is written in the
 
04:08:38.550 --> 04:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
bill takes on a life of its own we've
 
04:08:40.469 --> 04:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
seen this time and time again i mean
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
unique to this bill
 
04:08:45.590 --> 04:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm urging all of you to listen to
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
the voices of the constituents who have
 
04:08:49.990 --> 04:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
shown up here today mostly women and
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
their families and i want you to hear
 
04:08:55.670 --> 04:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
that the impact of midwifery any assault
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
on this profession
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
is an assault on the constituents of
 
04:09:00.870 --> 04:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
this state
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
that we serve
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:09:10.550 --> 04:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
i must say i drive past there every day
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
it'll be nice to put a face with the
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.110 --> 04:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:31.120 --> 04:09:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:38.950 --> 04:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the

04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
by saying thank you to
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
particularly members of the council who
 
04:09:57.990 --> 04:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
took time to come here the amount of
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
collaboration um and respect that
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
they've shown me in this dialogue as
 
04:10:03.189 --> 04:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
well as members of the public i think
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
this has been a very
 
04:10:08.830 --> 04:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
um it is not it was never my intent um
 
04:10:13.040 --> 04:10:14.149 align:start position:0%
um it is not it was never my intent um
to

04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
impact the ability of women to receive
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
care through midwifery others and i've
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
had extensive conversations with the
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
midwifery council i had drafted proposed
 
04:10:27.110 --> 04:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that i circulated to them
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
which would effectively change the
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
composition of the advisory council
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
as well as require a greater
 
04:10:38.710 --> 04:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
collaboration in the statute
 
04:10:38.720 --> 04:10:39.510 align:start position:0%
collaboration in the statute
the

04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:40.870 --> 04:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been raised are
 
04:10:40.880 --> 04:10:41.630 align:start position:0%
concerns that have been raised are
really

04:10:41.630 --> 04:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:10:41.640 --> 04:10:43.750 align:start position:0%
really

[Music]
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
the one thing that's missing here i
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
think is really the the
 
04:10:47.359 --> 04:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
think is really the the
justification

04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
justification
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
for the initial part of the bill
 
04:10:55.429 --> 04:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.030 --> 04:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to draw the committee's
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
my written testimony in which i laid out
 
04:11:02.399 --> 04:11:03.189 align:start position:0%
my written testimony in which i laid out
the

04:11:03.189 --> 04:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:05.189 --> 04:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
united states supreme court's decision
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
in north carolina state board of dental
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
examiners versus federal trade
 
04:11:08.399 --> 04:11:10.229 align:start position:0%
examiners versus federal trade
commission

04:11:10.229 --> 04:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with that opinion i
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
actually agree with a dissenting opinion
 
04:11:16.149 --> 04:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately there's no mechanism
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
to appeal a decision of the united
 
04:11:20.710 --> 04:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
states supreme court so it is what it is
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
and essentially what that case said was
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
when you have a state regulation
 
04:11:29.670 --> 04:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
comprised primarily of active market
 
04:11:29.680 --> 04:11:30.950 align:start position:0%
comprised primarily of active market
participants

04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
participants
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
which is which is the model we have in
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and obviously the general
 
04:11:37.510 --> 04:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
court chose wisely
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
prior to the 2015 case
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
when that happens
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
and they
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
make decisions either through licensure
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
or through regulation
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
or through investigation of complaints
 
04:11:54.630 --> 04:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
that that decision is subject to
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
antitrust scrutiny and there is no
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
immunity under the state
 
04:12:01.269 --> 04:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
if there's no state supervision which we
 
04:12:03.269 --> 04:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
have done here
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
the state is absolutely 100 gonna be
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
sued at some point i fully believe that
 
04:12:09.590 --> 04:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's warranted or not as a prior
 
04:12:09.600 --> 04:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
whether it's warranted or not as a prior
litigator

04:12:10.710 --> 04:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
litigator
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
this bill is really intended to be
 
04:12:12.479 --> 04:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
this bill is really intended to be
proactive

04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
proactive
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
we've got 27 licensees so the risk is
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
greater for in particular for this board
 
04:12:21.750 --> 04:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
because everybody knows each other
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think there's probably more members of
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
the public here than are actually
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
regulated by the council
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to have this
 
04:12:30.159 --> 04:12:31.670 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to have this
conversation

04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
with that backdrop
 
04:12:33.680 --> 04:12:34.950 align:start position:0%
with that backdrop
um

04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
of course the supreme court recognized
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
that the state is free to choose not to
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
immunity under the sherman act and if
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
the state would like to keep such a
 
04:12:48.149 --> 04:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
model um
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
then that's the state's prerogative
 
04:12:50.880 --> 04:12:51.910 align:start position:0%
then that's the state's prerogative
but

04:12:51.910 --> 04:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
it is a significant concern i have
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
um it's a significant concern that i
 
04:12:58.469 --> 04:12:58.479 align:start position:0%
think we should all have because i just
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
want to play this out
 
04:13:03.110 --> 04:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
if we if the state is sued by the ftc
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i have no doubt at some point that
 
04:13:08.229 --> 04:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:10.309 --> 04:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
the feds will file a lawsuit
 
04:13:12.229 --> 04:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
and we will either be forced into some
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
sort of consent decree
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
where we completely take away the
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
ability to regulate the professions in
 
04:13:21.030 --> 04:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
the manner that the state has chosen
 
04:13:23.670 --> 04:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
um or essentially it'll go to trial and
 
04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
the judge will choose to do the same
 
04:13:29.910 --> 04:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:31.830 --> 04:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
i would like to see new hampshire retain
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
its ability to determine what type of
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing structure it
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
should have
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
but at some point i think as we've seen
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
in other states north carolina and other
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
states i think that we're going to be
 
04:13:47.830 --> 04:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:50.389 --> 04:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to answer any questions
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
04:13:52.830 --> 04:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
the notion of an advisory council is not
 
04:14:04.870 --> 04:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
something i just dreamt up
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
we have that model in place here for
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
certain boards already
 
04:14:10.309 --> 04:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
that is the model that other states
 
04:14:10.319 --> 04:14:12.070 align:start position:0%
that is the model that other states
utilize

04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
04:14:14.389 --> 04:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
including vermont
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
there is a way for the boards and
 
04:14:19.269 --> 04:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
members of the profession and members of
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
administration to work collaboratively
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
with each other to ensure that the
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
expertise is appropriately leveraged
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
that members of the profession have an
 
04:14:31.030 --> 04:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
active voice and
 
04:14:31.040 --> 04:14:31.910 align:start position:0%
active voice and
in

04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
the regulations that are put into place
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
while at the same time providing
 
04:14:38.309 --> 04:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient state oversight
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the state is not uh
 
04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
potentially risking any liability for
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
any decisions that could that could
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
potentially be argued or viewed as
 
04:14:49.830 --> 04:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive in nature and whether
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
they are or they're not it doesn't
 
04:14:53.110 --> 04:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
matter because as we all know
 
04:14:55.349 --> 04:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
you can file a lawsuit against anything
 
04:14:57.910 --> 04:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
um so in any event happy to take any
 
04:14:59.670 --> 04:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
questions that's you have my written
 
04:15:02.149 --> 04:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that's the crux of
 
04:15:05.830 --> 04:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
the gist of this bill
 
04:15:07.510 --> 04:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative lekis
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:15:11.189 --> 04:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
so given
 
04:15:13.189 --> 04:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
those are your goals i'm i'm wondering
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
how that led to the
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
changes in the membership of the
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
advisory council which
 
04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
i saw as and i think other people here
 
04:15:24.630 --> 04:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
have seen is one of the most concerning
 
04:15:27.110 --> 04:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
parts of this i agree and i'll and i'll
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
be completely honest with you
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative as i was with the council
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't fully appreciate the um
 
04:15:36.070 --> 04:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
history there
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
um essentially all of our current
 
04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
advisory councils have three members
 
04:15:42.790 --> 04:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
so when drafting this i just picked the
 
04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know different types of people that
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
are currently serving on the committee
 
04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
i the amendment that i've drafted for
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
consideration i passed to the council
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
would have ex would expand that include
 
04:15:56.870 --> 04:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
the pediatrician the obstetrician the
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
three midwifery council members
 
04:15:59.359 --> 04:16:00.550 align:start position:0%
three midwifery council members
um

04:16:00.550 --> 04:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know i think it's important to note
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
though that at some point every member
 
04:16:06.149 --> 04:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
of this every licensee is going to be on
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:16:09.990 --> 04:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
because there's only 27 of them so i
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
think that's why
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:19.510 --> 04:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and thank you
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions gordon here
 
04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the supreme court's
 
04:16:28.710 --> 04:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
opinion in the case of north carolina
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
state board of dental examiners versus
 
04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
the ftc
 
04:16:35.030 --> 04:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
and it appears that this case began
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
when the board issued cease and desist
 
04:16:39.990 --> 04:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
orders to non-dentists who were
 
04:16:42.229 --> 04:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
providing teeth whitening services at a
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
lower cost
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
than the dentists were offering would
 
04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
you not agree that that is substantially
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
different than what's going on with
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
midwifery in the state of new hampshire
 
04:16:52.229 --> 04:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
where the midwives are providing their
 
04:16:54.550 --> 04:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
services at substantially lower costs
 
04:16:56.309 --> 04:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
than their competitors being on being
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
hospital births
 
04:16:59.590 --> 04:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
i would agree that case had different
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
facts but i do not agree that the ftc's
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
04:17:06.790 --> 04:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
essentially look into antitrust matters
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
or antitrust law generally is limited to
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
to those circumstances
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i can give you a long list of
 
04:17:16.710 --> 04:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
examples of observations we've made in
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
board meetings
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
um where
 
04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that the supreme court
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
recognized that you can't as a
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
professional and i'll say the same is
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
true for myself as a lawyer it's hard to
 
04:17:29.110 --> 04:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
take off that hat
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
and i think what the supreme court
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
recognized is inherent
 
04:17:33.120 --> 04:17:34.229 align:start position:0%
recognized is inherent
in

04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to
 
04:17:35.760 --> 04:17:38.710 align:start position:0%
the ability to
regulate

04:17:38.710 --> 04:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
whether implicit or otherwise
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to you're going to be
 
04:17:46.469 --> 04:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
swayed by your personal um
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
experience particularly as a business
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
owner this is this is more of a concern
 
04:17:54.550 --> 04:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
right when people in their business
 
04:17:57.030 --> 04:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know for example
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
if a board
 
04:18:00.830 --> 04:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
were to impose
 
04:18:00.840 --> 04:18:02.790 align:start position:0%
were to impose
regulations

04:18:02.790 --> 04:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
limiting let's say the dental board were
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
to impose regulations
 
04:18:09.189 --> 04:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
limiting the ability of a qualified
 
04:18:09.199 --> 04:18:10.870 align:start position:0%
limiting the ability of a qualified
anesthesiologist

04:18:10.870 --> 04:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
to provide anesthesia services in a
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
dental care practice
 
04:18:16.389 --> 04:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
because it would
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
protect the public but actually uh
 
04:18:23.349 --> 04:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
protect the business of the dental
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
anesthesia providers i think that's
 
04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
something the ftc could look into
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
and yet that's exactly some of the
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
things that we've observed
 
04:18:33.990 --> 04:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's limited to the
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
facts that were laid out in that case
 
04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
i think there's a lot of
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
soft decisions that are made that we see
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
um that are
 
04:18:47.189 --> 04:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
at times driven by the other hat that
 
04:18:49.750 --> 04:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
people are wearing and that's not to say
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
04:18:54.070 --> 04:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's you know these are people right
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
they wear different hats i wear many
 
04:18:57.510 --> 04:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
different hats and i think that's what
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
the supreme court recognizes that it's
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
very hard to take all hats off and so
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some state supervision
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
in order for the state to claim immunity
 
04:19:09.750 --> 04:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'll give you another example i think i
 
04:19:12.389 --> 04:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
gave it to you earlier the body art
 
04:19:14.950 --> 04:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
body artists wanted a bill to allow
 
04:19:16.389 --> 04:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
estheticians to be able to perform
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
microblading we got the bill
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
then they got a bunch of calls saying ah
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
that's going to ruin my business so they
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
decided no we're not going to write
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
rules well there's sufficient state
 
04:19:27.349 --> 04:19:27.359 align:start position:0%
supervision because they're an advisory
 
04:19:29.110 --> 04:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
board so i was able to say no we're
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with rulemaking
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
and please provide me with
 
04:19:31.920 --> 04:19:33.189 align:start position:0%
and please provide me with
recommendations

04:19:33.189 --> 04:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
and they did
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's a that's an issue that if we
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have that model
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
um they certainly wouldn't have
 
04:19:39.199 --> 04:19:40.389 align:start position:0%
um they certainly wouldn't have
regulated

04:19:40.389 --> 04:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
and i have no doubt that the
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
estheticians who are quite vocal you
 
04:19:45.590 --> 04:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
know would have would have been
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about that those are the types
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.550 --> 04:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative grota
 
04:19:56.790 --> 04:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you this morning when we heard
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1059
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
which was related to
 
04:20:04.630 --> 04:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
creating the position of
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
advisory boards for those you i'm sorry
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
positioner for the executive director of
 
04:20:09.279 --> 04:20:10.710 align:start position:0%
positioner for the executive director of
oplc

04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the advisory board
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
how would how does this situation differ
 
04:20:23.110 --> 04:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
um this situation is different in the
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
sense that what motivated a plc to
 
04:20:28.630 --> 04:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
pursue this bill was not a lack of
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
quorum it's more of just the really
 
04:20:33.110 --> 04:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
small size of the industry
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
and or the profession and the fact that
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think because of its small size it's
 
04:20:41.269 --> 04:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
at higher risk for scrutiny
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
on an anti-trust level everybody knows
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
each other
 
04:20:46.950 --> 04:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up please follow up
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
do we have any other similar
 
04:20:52.950 --> 04:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
boards that could fall under this
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
issue yes um
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
you have a court reporter's bill in
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
front of you but that that board
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
actually has
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
the two issues they're not meeting as a
 
04:21:03.990 --> 04:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
forum and there's only 60 people who are
 
04:21:04.000 --> 04:21:06.389 align:start position:0%
forum and there's only 60 people who are
regulated

04:21:06.389 --> 04:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
my current one of our current advisory
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
boards reflexology
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's also i think only 29
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
licensees and so that's why that model
 
04:21:15.429 --> 04:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
works out well
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
um we so the advisory boards generally
 
04:21:22.149 --> 04:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i i have two questions
 
04:21:29.520 --> 04:21:31.750 align:start position:0%
thank you i i have two questions
um

04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
one of them is aren't there any sort of
 
04:21:34.319 --> 04:21:35.269 align:start position:0%
one of them is aren't there any sort of
laws

04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
in existence in statute maybe not in the
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
oplc section
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
that protect the state to be against
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
being sued for this kind of thing
 
04:21:48.149 --> 04:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
well you they would be immune
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
if they were state supervision that's
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what the supreme court case said
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
that the state officials who are
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
arguably acting in an antitrust
 
04:21:58.800 --> 04:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
arguably acting in an antitrust
manner

04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
manner
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
could be immune from suit and liability
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
if the state had actively supervised
 
04:22:07.269 --> 04:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
them and that means that somebody who's
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
not part of the marketplace a member of
 
04:22:11.670 --> 04:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
the profession it has the capacity to
 
04:22:11.680 --> 04:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
the profession it has the capacity to
essentially

04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
04:22:15.429 --> 04:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
vet their decision-making process
 
04:22:16.870 --> 04:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly what this issue is
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
about there's
 
04:22:19.750 --> 04:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
04:22:22.469 --> 04:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
um there's no state supervision
 
04:22:25.110 --> 04:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
therefore you know for our 50 licensing
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
boards if one of them were to make a
 
04:22:27.680 --> 04:22:28.790 align:start position:0%
boards if one of them were to make a
decision

04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:22:31.590 --> 04:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
um or regulate in such a manner that
 
04:22:33.990 --> 04:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
could be perceived as keeping people out
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the marketplace
 
04:22:37.269 --> 04:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
because they want to retain business
 
04:22:39.830 --> 04:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's valid or not
 
04:22:39.840 --> 04:22:41.030 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's valid or not
um

04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
this state would be liable um potential
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
the state would be liable
 
04:22:47.910 --> 04:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
you you're recognized for follow-up but
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
if you could please bring your
 
04:22:51.429 --> 04:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
microphone closer to you because we
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
can't hear anything that you're saying
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:55.510 --> 04:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative likeliest you'll be after
 
04:22:57.429 --> 04:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
after representative fellows
 
04:22:57.439 --> 04:22:59.670 align:start position:0%
after representative fellows
um

04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:59.680 --> 04:23:00.950 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:23:00.960 --> 04:23:02.070 align:start position:0%
so
uh

04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
why isn't that the the staff that you
 
04:23:08.149 --> 04:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
provide that you provide legal advice
 
04:23:08.159 --> 04:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
provide that you provide legal advice
and

04:23:09.110 --> 04:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
administrative support to the boards why
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
isn't that enough
 
04:23:13.600 --> 04:23:14.550 align:start position:0%
isn't that enough
to

04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
qualify for supervision and my second
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
question is can you just tell me the
 
04:23:22.550 --> 04:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
difference between a board and a council
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
regarding the letter there's really not
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
a difference
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
we've got boards councils and
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
commissions they all function in the
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
same way
 
04:23:32.149 --> 04:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
regarding the former um
 
04:23:33.990 --> 04:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
providing assistance and administrative
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
support to does not constitute
 
04:23:37.830 --> 04:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
supervision supervision according to the
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
supreme court connotes some sort of
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.960 --> 04:23:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
to

04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
be part of the decision making i will
 
04:23:45.520 --> 04:23:46.870 align:start position:0%
be part of the decision making i will
say

04:23:46.870 --> 04:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:23:49.110 --> 04:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
whereas providing support
 
04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
does not
 
04:23:50.560 --> 04:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
does not
and

04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:54.630 --> 04:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
speaking not specifically to the council
 
04:23:57.110 --> 04:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's quite common for a plc to provide
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
legal advice and that's not that doesn't
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
go that's not heated so um
 
04:24:09.510 --> 04:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative lekas
 
04:24:17.030 --> 04:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:24:18.950 --> 04:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
sort of related i understand your
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
concern um
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:24:25.030 --> 04:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know what what i'm trying to get and
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
i i've got a question here is
 
04:24:30.630 --> 04:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
how can we let the midwives regulate
 
04:24:30.640 --> 04:24:32.309 align:start position:0%
how can we let the midwives regulate
midwifery

04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
midwifery
 
04:24:35.110 --> 04:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
while having some state supervision
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
to prevent them from getting in legal
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
antitrust trouble
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
related to that is in the other language
 
04:24:44.070 --> 04:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
we had elsewhere where it says oplc
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
executive director can do something
 
04:24:48.630 --> 04:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
with the um advice of the board the
 
04:24:50.149 --> 04:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
question is what does that really mean
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
where's the power who has control over
 
04:24:52.560 --> 04:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
where's the power who has control over
what

04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:24:55.990 --> 04:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
so with advice of the board means that i
 
04:24:58.070 --> 04:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
have to seek out advice of the board but
 
04:25:00.070 --> 04:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately the agency is the decision
 
04:25:00.080 --> 04:25:02.229 align:start position:0%
ultimately the agency is the decision
maker

04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
maker
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
that provides sufficient state
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
supervision but it also underlies the
 
04:25:08.550 --> 04:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
concerns that that professionals have
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
which is that the professionals don't
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
have complete control over the
 
04:25:11.760 --> 04:25:13.429 align:start position:0%
have complete control over the
profession

04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
profession
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
so this this bill
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
is one way
 
04:25:17.040 --> 04:25:18.630 align:start position:0%
is one way
of

04:25:18.630 --> 04:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know threading the needle so to
 
04:25:21.910 --> 04:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
speak and trying to
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
i think meet justifiable concerns
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
regarding uh liability
 
04:25:29.110 --> 04:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
but i think that the the council members
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
of the council other also proposed other
 
04:25:31.359 --> 04:25:32.550 align:start position:0%
of the council other also proposed other
language

04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that would
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that would actually
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
satisfy north carolina dental's
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
analysis i'd have to go back and take a
 
04:25:42.960 --> 04:25:44.309 align:start position:0%
analysis i'd have to go back and take a
look

04:25:44.309 --> 04:25:44.319 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
the agency is not i mean the agency will
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
work with the council work with members
 
04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
of the legislature in order to get to a
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
point where all
 
04:25:55.990 --> 04:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
all concerns are satisfied
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.439 --> 04:26:00.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:03.269 --> 04:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know would it satisfy do you think
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know the the legal requirement if
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
there was some kind of language that
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
said that uh
 
04:26:11.990 --> 04:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
that didn't give oplc any
 
04:26:14.550 --> 04:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
control over the the practice
 
04:26:17.510 --> 04:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
um you know what what's required to be a
 
04:26:19.910 --> 04:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
midwife or or all that
 
04:26:23.590 --> 04:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
other than specifically to um
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
that you know you could provide legal
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
advice on whether or not this conflicts
 
04:26:27.600 --> 04:26:28.710 align:start position:0%
advice on whether or not this conflicts
with

04:26:28.710 --> 04:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:26:30.309 --> 04:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the wording would be
 
04:26:31.990 --> 04:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know anti-trust law
 
04:26:34.469 --> 04:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
um and that that would be
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.349 --> 04:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so so presently the state
 
04:26:43.349 --> 04:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
presently the state has the capacity
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
through the attorney general right to
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
direct state officials to do certain
 
04:26:48.000 --> 04:26:49.269 align:start position:0%
direct state officials to do certain
things

04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:26:49.279 --> 04:26:51.670 align:start position:0%
things
um

04:26:51.670 --> 04:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
in my experience that's not often that
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't regularly occur
 
04:26:56.080 --> 04:26:57.269 align:start position:0%
doesn't regularly occur
um

04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
because it usually has to get really bad
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
in order for that to happen and even
 
04:27:00.399 --> 04:27:01.189 align:start position:0%
in order for that to happen and even
then

04:27:01.189 --> 04:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
i haven't observed that happen
 
04:27:02.560 --> 04:27:03.750 align:start position:0%
i haven't observed that happen
frequently

04:27:03.750 --> 04:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
you could certainly have some sort of
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement but the issue that
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
we're running into
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm not speaking specifically to the
 
04:27:14.389 --> 04:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
midwifery council is that there there
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
are certain boards am i a very small
 
04:27:16.960 --> 04:27:18.229 align:start position:0%
are certain boards am i a very small
minority

04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
minority
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
that regardless of what the statute says
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
they continue to do something in controv
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
contravention of the statute i can't
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
force somebody
 
04:27:28.229 --> 04:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
to do something that they don't want to
 
04:27:28.239 --> 04:27:30.309 align:start position:0%
to do something that they don't want to
do

04:27:30.309 --> 04:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:27:32.309 --> 04:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
so i think one thing the state could do
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
under the supreme court case the supreme
 
04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
court case could have i mean the state
 
04:27:39.110 --> 04:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
could have a clear policy favoring
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive regulation i don't
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
think the state wants to do that and i
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recommend it but that would
 
04:27:46.229 --> 04:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
satisfy the concerns
 
04:27:47.910 --> 04:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
you could have some sort of veto
 
04:27:50.070 --> 04:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
authority by a different body whether it
 
04:27:53.189 --> 04:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
be me or the legislature
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
certain decisions i think that would
 
04:28:04.469 --> 04:28:04.479 align:start position:0%
help i think that would satisfy
 
04:28:06.149 --> 04:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
and meet the requirements for state
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
supervision i think there are a couple
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
of different ways we could get there
 
04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
but ultimately you need somebody who's
 
04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
not a member of the profession who can
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
essentially veto certain decisions
 
04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's i think what the case gets at and
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:28:21.269 --> 04:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
i think that's what the general court
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be aware of just generally with
 
04:28:25.349 --> 04:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
our structure
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to see if we can work
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
towards that whether it's this bill or
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:36.870 --> 04:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative grota did you have a
 
04:28:36.880 --> 04:28:38.469 align:start position:0%
representative grota did you have a
question

04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:28:40.229 --> 04:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative black is asked it so
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.030 --> 04:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.830 --> 04:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
never going to get house broken
 
04:28:53.840 --> 04:28:55.030 align:start position:0%
never going to get house broken
um

04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
is uh i this is actually a question
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
prompted by what i've been hearing for
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%

04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
and all i want to say is you know
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
hearing that this is because of a
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
concern that the state might be sued
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
we have to take a step back and look at
 
04:31:08.950 --> 04:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
what's really truly right for
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
our patients our mothers and our babies
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
i can tell you right now what's
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
happening in healthcare that is overseen
 
04:31:19.990 --> 04:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
by oplc there's over 60
 
04:31:23.269 --> 04:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
licensed clinicians that zoom call with
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm a part of on a weekly basis
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
that are feeling very very um
 
04:31:33.030 --> 04:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
tied to doing what they used to be able
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
to do for their patients
 
04:31:38.309 --> 04:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
for example the autonomy to prescribe a
 
04:31:38.319 --> 04:31:39.750 align:start position:0%
for example the autonomy to prescribe a
medication

04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
medication
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
they actually have emails from their
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
employers that say if you prescribe this
 
04:31:47.670 --> 04:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
you will be fired we have patients that
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
are in the icu
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we're requesting basic interventions
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
that were always protocol with a patient
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the icu for daily labs right you
 
04:31:59.189 --> 04:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
would think you would get daily labs in
 
04:32:01.110 --> 04:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
the icu
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
tpn total parental nutrition for someone
 
04:32:06.070 --> 04:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
who's been in the hospital for over six
 
04:32:08.950 --> 04:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
days they're not getting nutrition basic
 
04:32:11.349 --> 04:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
things that were always a practice of
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
health care
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
we are now told
 
04:32:18.550 --> 04:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
in a video by dartmouth-hitchcock at 302
 
04:32:20.870 --> 04:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
that if you do anything outside of what
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
the administrators have deemed the
 
04:32:23.279 --> 04:32:25.189 align:start position:0%
the administrators have deemed the
protocol

04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
you will be disciplined
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
with me ma'am is this relative to it it
 
04:32:29.040 --> 04:32:30.149 align:start position:0%
with me ma'am is this relative to it it
is

04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
yes it is i'm getting right to it i
 
04:32:31.840 --> 04:32:32.830 align:start position:0%
yes it is i'm getting right to it i
promise

04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
promise
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
um individuals who
 
04:32:38.790 --> 04:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
are are practicing what's in the best
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
interest of their patient in that moment
 
04:32:42.950 --> 04:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
are being
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
stifled and it's costing lives
 
04:32:45.680 --> 04:32:46.550 align:start position:0%
stifled and it's costing lives
so

04:32:46.550 --> 04:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:32:49.990 --> 04:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
if we could somehow have the combination
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
of the oversight to protect the state
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
like we do now where they are
 
04:32:57.670 --> 04:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
collaborating but you allow the autonomy
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
of those providers to do what they need
 
04:33:01.269 --> 04:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
to do in that moment with their
 
04:33:01.279 --> 04:33:02.630 align:start position:0%
to do in that moment with their
experience

04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
when they've gone through the schooling
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
the testing the licensure
 
04:33:09.750 --> 04:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
and everything else without now what's
 
04:33:09.760 --> 04:33:10.949 align:start position:0%
and everything else without now what's
happening

04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
happening
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
is the federal government
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
is dictating
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
what people can do
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
in a way we've never seen before
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that's my concern as we discern that
 
04:33:26.709 --> 04:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
these associations for midwifery
 
04:33:26.719 --> 04:33:28.230 align:start position:0%
these associations for midwifery
reflexology

04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
reflexology
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be come under these
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
umbrellas the government overreach
 
04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
in my opinion and what i'm seeing in the
 
04:33:38.869 --> 04:33:38.879 align:start position:0%
last two years has actually cost lives
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
so we just need to be aware that
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
as we over regulate as government
 
04:33:44.320 --> 04:33:45.750 align:start position:0%
as we over regulate as government
overreaches

04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
overreaches
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
there is the potential for things to be
 
04:33:48.561 --> 04:33:49.510 align:start position:0%
there is the potential for things to be
done

04:33:49.510 --> 04:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
done in a collective professional
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
decision making but rather in the fear
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
of litigation and that's that's that
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
just can be very dangerous
 
04:34:03.349 --> 04:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time i oppose this
 
04:34:03.359 --> 04:34:06.789 align:start position:0%

house bill 1030
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
is what we would call a repair bill
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
this is based on a piece of legislation
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
that was passed
 
04:36:10.949 --> 04:36:10.959 align:start position:0%
in a prior session that inadvertently
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
omitted two branches of the united
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
states military
 
04:36:17.269 --> 04:36:17.279 align:start position:0%
that was something that was discovered
 
04:36:17.279 --> 04:36:18.629 align:start position:0%
that was something that was discovered
during

04:36:18.629 --> 04:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
during
 
04:36:21.429 --> 04:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
the process and frankly we were told
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%
that the senate was going to make those
 
04:36:22.959 --> 04:36:24.070 align:start position:0%
that the senate was going to make those
corrections

04:36:24.070 --> 04:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
04:36:26.949 --> 04:36:26.959 align:start position:0%
and they clearly did not
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
so all this bill does is it
 
04:36:33.510 --> 04:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
it adds the coast guard
 
04:36:33.520 --> 04:36:34.551 align:start position:0%
it adds the coast guard
and

04:36:34.551 --> 04:36:34.561 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:36.310 --> 04:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
air force marine corps and coast guard
 
04:36:38.310 --> 04:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
into the
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
list of military or department of
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
defense branches
 
04:36:41.760 --> 04:36:42.629 align:start position:0%
defense branches
that

04:36:42.629 --> 04:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
would qualify for the equivalency into
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
the lna field
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not entirely sure
 
04:36:53.189 --> 04:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
if the emails that came to me came to
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
all of you but there was some question
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
in reference to the space force not
 
04:36:58.551 --> 04:36:58.561 align:start position:0%
being included the medics in the space
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
force fall under the u.s air force they
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
do not have their own space force
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
medical corps
 
04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
so therefore they are not included
 
04:37:10.150 --> 04:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
beyond that like i said this is merely
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
just a housekeeping bill to
 
04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
place the branches of the military back
 
04:37:19.990 --> 04:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
or into the statute that were omitted
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:26.949 --> 04:37:26.959 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
seeing on thank you very much thank you
 
04:37:29.910 --> 04:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:37:38.629 --> 04:37:38.639 align:start position:0%

jess edwards representing auburn chester
 
04:37:44.470 --> 04:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
and sandown
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
um i
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
i meant to be supporting uh
 
04:37:50.230 --> 04:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative pearson in his uh
 
04:37:52.709 --> 04:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
presentation of this so i'm there's some
 
04:37:54.789 --> 04:37:54.799 align:start position:0%
risk of some redundancy but
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
um i've been following this bill with
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
interest for
 
04:38:00.789 --> 04:38:00.799 align:start position:0%
a couple of years now since it started
 
04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
with the air force and army recognizing
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
their medical training their enlisted
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
medical training
 
04:38:06.080 --> 04:38:07.269 align:start position:0%
medical training
and

04:38:07.269 --> 04:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
we noticed kind of early on that the
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
marines and navy had been overlooked and
 
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's just because the bill's
 
04:38:13.840 --> 04:38:15.109 align:start position:0%
i think it's just because the bill's
authors

04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
authors
 
04:38:15.119 --> 04:38:16.310 align:start position:0%
authors
hadn't

04:38:16.310 --> 04:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
hadn't
 
04:38:16.320 --> 04:38:17.510 align:start position:0%
hadn't
understood

04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
understood
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
how the marines used the navy corpsmen
 
04:38:23.109 --> 04:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
and and so it just got overlooked and we
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
04:38:28.000 --> 04:38:29.429 align:start position:0%
that this bill
could

04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:38:31.830 --> 04:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
self-adapt over time
 
04:38:31.840 --> 04:38:32.551 align:start position:0%
self-adapt over time
so

04:38:32.551 --> 04:38:32.561 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
we used the phrase on line seven
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
or others meaning
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
the department of defense
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
space command will be one of the
 
04:38:45.109 --> 04:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
department of defense and however they
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the next decade decide to staff their
 
04:38:47.680 --> 04:38:48.709 align:start position:0%
in the next decade decide to staff their
medic

04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
medic
 
04:38:50.789 --> 04:38:50.799 align:start position:0%
enlisted pool whether it be air force or
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
however they do it this bill should be
 
04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
intended to be flexible enough to adapt
 
04:38:58.949 --> 04:38:58.959 align:start position:0%
automatically over time without rewrite
 
04:39:01.029 --> 04:39:01.039 align:start position:0%
i'm a little uncomfortable putting
 
04:39:02.551 --> 04:39:02.561 align:start position:0%
things in there like
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
a specific military occupational skill
 
04:39:08.230 --> 04:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
like 68 whiskey because when i went into
 
04:39:10.869 --> 04:39:10.879 align:start position:0%
the army many decades ago those were
 
04:39:13.670 --> 04:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
called 91 bravos so i just would hate to
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
see the
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know law get weird because the dod
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
changes mosses but i think that's fine
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
for now we can we can just watch it and
 
04:39:26.470 --> 04:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know what a four november
 
04:39:26.480 --> 04:39:27.429 align:start position:0%
i don't know what a four november
zero

04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
zero
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
x-ray one is but i did look it up on the
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
internet and it seems to be the correct
 
04:39:33.039 --> 04:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
internet and it seems to be the correct
nomenclature

04:39:34.800 --> 04:39:34.810 align:start position:0%
nomenclature
 
04:39:34.810 --> 04:39:36.310 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:39:38.550 --> 04:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
i think i think this is uh really an
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
important bill we already passed the
 
04:39:43.030 --> 04:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill in concept last year we want to
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
recognize the military training
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
and bring those
 
04:39:49.270 --> 04:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
young men and women into our health care
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%

04:40:00.628 --> 04:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
spread out through the bill so we can
 
04:40:03.030 --> 04:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
avoid having to do this again
 
04:40:06.070 --> 04:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee

holderness
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
last year when we passed hb2
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that included a section
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
that combined
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
two boards the the board of speech
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
pathology and i'm not sure the exact
 
04:41:15.030 --> 04:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
title but the board that that had to do
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
with audiologists and hearing aid
 
04:41:17.760 --> 04:41:19.750 align:start position:0%
with audiologists and hearing aid
dealers

04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
04:41:22.470 --> 04:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
in the process of doing that
 
04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
the language
 
04:41:28.708 --> 04:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
neglected to include an audiologist
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
so this is a
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
correction to make sure that there's at
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
least one audiologist on the board that
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
oversees audiologists
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
all this bill does
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:41:47.350 --> 04:41:47.360 align:start position:0%

04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%

academy of audiology
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the amendment is to have
 
04:42:49.510 --> 04:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
both an audiologist and a hearing aid
 
04:42:52.868 --> 04:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
dealer sitting on this board
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
as these are different providers by

just briefly to run through that

audiologists are college and or

of practice includes that as well
 
04:43:52.070 --> 04:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
hearing aid dealers are simply trained

to perform a basic test for the purpose

aids
 
04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
and there's primarily business people
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:39.670 --> 04:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
um that's don't want to go too much more
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
than that
 
04:44:42.628 --> 04:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
the other comment i have as i'm aware
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
that the board has not actually met
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
since its inception
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
in july
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
and we the new hampshire academy of
 
04:44:53.830 --> 04:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
audiology has provided two names for
 
04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
members qualified members to sit on that
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
board and as yet that position has not
 
04:45:01.430 --> 04:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
been filled and we're a little
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
frustrated by that and we'd like to look
 
04:45:05.670 --> 04:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
forward to trying to get things moving
 
04:45:05.680 --> 04:45:06.868 align:start position:0%
forward to trying to get things moving
along

04:45:06.868 --> 04:45:06.878 align:start position:0%

04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair members of
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
the committee lindsay courtney executive
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
director oplc
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
um this bill is pretty clear uh this was
 
04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
a request that we made
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
in order to clarify that both an
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
audiologist and hearing aid dealer
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
should be represented on the board as
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
oplc believes that professionals should
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
have input into the regulation of their
 
04:46:19.280 --> 04:46:20.550 align:start position:0%
have input into the regulation of their
professions

04:46:20.550 --> 04:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
professions
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions if the
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
committee has any but other than that i
 
04:46:25.830 --> 04:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
think this bill is pretty
 
04:46:25.840 --> 04:46:27.350 align:start position:0%
think this bill is pretty
straightforward

04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
i do have a question i noticed that
 
04:46:31.750 --> 04:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
you're making the board six members
 
04:46:34.550 --> 04:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
so quorum is now four
 
04:46:34.560 --> 04:46:36.470 align:start position:0%
so quorum is now four
and

04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:39.030 --> 04:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
you have the possibility of ties
 
04:46:39.040 --> 04:46:40.628 align:start position:0%
you have the possibility of ties
true

04:46:40.628 --> 04:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:46:40.638 --> 04:46:41.830 align:start position:0%
true
um

04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
i think we would we would welcome an
 
04:46:48.150 --> 04:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it an odd number
 
04:46:48.160 --> 04:46:49.030 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it an odd number
are

04:46:49.030 --> 04:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
but we're a little concerned with
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
growing committees because we're already
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
having issues with uh obtaining members
 
04:46:56.160 --> 04:46:57.030 align:start position:0%
having issues with uh obtaining members
so

04:46:57.030 --> 04:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:58.868 --> 04:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't we wouldn't want to make the
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
committee so large i suppose seven would
 
04:47:00.878 --> 04:47:02.628 align:start position:0%
committee so large i suppose seven would
be

04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:47:02.638 --> 04:47:06.230 align:start position:0%
be
okay

04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's still pretty big but given the
 
04:47:09.670 --> 04:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
profession but
 
04:47:11.110 --> 04:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
but obviously we would support an
 
04:47:12.550 --> 04:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it an odd number of
 
04:47:12.560 --> 04:47:14.788 align:start position:0%
amendment to make it an odd number of
individuals

04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:23.350 --> 04:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you all right seeing none
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add one piece of
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
information based on
 
04:47:43.030 --> 04:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
what we heard
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
i know that um
 
04:47:50.230 --> 04:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
someone was nominated to be on the board
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
back in i think it was october the the
 
04:47:56.708 --> 04:47:56.718 align:start position:0%
governor made a nomination but then for
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
reasons we don't need to go into
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
that nomination was withdrawn so you
 
04:48:04.550 --> 04:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
know just to show you that there has
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
been an attempt to
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
get more people on the board and
 
04:48:11.670 --> 04:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
i could also share that
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
there was
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
some people
 
04:48:16.310 --> 04:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
i heard from constituents
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
that wished that there were two
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
audiologists on the board
 
04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
just in case one was not available so if
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
we want to increase the number that
 
04:48:27.190 --> 04:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
would be one way to do it make it two
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
audiologists instead of one
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows are
 
04:48:33.910 --> 04:48:33.920 align:start position:0%

address a problem we found
 
04:50:08.550 --> 04:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the medicare for schools program
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
where it was determined that a fair
 
04:50:10.878 --> 04:50:11.910 align:start position:0%
where it was determined that a fair
number

04:50:11.910 --> 04:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
of the speech language
 
04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
professionals in the school systems were
 
04:50:21.110 --> 04:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
some of them were given
 
04:50:24.390 --> 04:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
most of them are given temporary
 
04:50:24.400 --> 04:50:25.910 align:start position:0%
most of them are given temporary
licenses

04:50:25.910 --> 04:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
a good number of them qualified
 
04:50:32.550 --> 04:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
for a regular license some others don't
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
and those were
 
04:50:42.390 --> 04:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:42.400 --> 04:50:43.910 align:start position:0%
 
different

04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
profession different education they did
 
04:50:50.550 --> 04:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
graduate level training
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
in various issues
 
04:50:56.230 --> 04:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily the ones specified
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
by the speech language pathologists
 
04:51:00.240 --> 04:51:01.910 align:start position:0%
by the speech language pathologists
so

04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
this bill expands the
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.868 --> 04:51:12.878 align:start position:0%
people with that
 
04:51:14.868 --> 04:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
alternate education
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
to get so that they can get an
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate license
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure it was a request of jail
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
educa or the department of education or
 
04:51:29.670 --> 04:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
oplc but it was

simple one
 
04:51:45.350 --> 04:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
just looking at this
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
as it now creates a
 
04:51:49.590 --> 04:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph b and move c back so this is
 
04:51:49.600 --> 04:51:50.550 align:start position:0%
paragraph b and move c back so this is
now

04:51:50.550 --> 04:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
taking the requirement of a master's
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
degree and now allowing folks with a
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree to
 
04:51:58.150 --> 04:51:58.160 align:start position:0%
be licensed in this profession is that
 
04:52:00.868 --> 04:52:00.878 align:start position:0%

04:52:03.270 --> 04:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
sir okay it allows people with a
 
04:52:05.670 --> 04:52:05.680 align:start position:0%

04:53:37.920 --> 04:53:39.750 align:start position:0%
i think i might be providing some
testimony

04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:53:42.550 --> 04:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
that i'm not sure if you already have so
 
04:53:44.150 --> 04:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i'm going to be a little
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
ahead of what you already know or what's
 
04:53:48.788 --> 04:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
in you in front of you
 
04:53:51.590 --> 04:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
so my background pertains to
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
my personal professional affiliations is
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm the past president of new hampshire
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
speech language hearing association
 
04:54:01.350 --> 04:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
past president and vice president of
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
governmental affairs
 
04:54:06.628 --> 04:54:06.638 align:start position:0%
a past member of the speech pathology
 
04:54:09.030 --> 04:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
licensing board from the department of
 
04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
allied health
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
and i also was a past member for the
 
04:54:14.708 --> 04:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
committee of
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
three renewal of speech specialist rule
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
rules with the department of education
 
04:54:23.708 --> 04:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
um and i that was somewhere in like the
 
04:54:25.990 --> 04:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
mid-2000s so
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
um that's what i've got for my
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
background and i was probably on the
 
04:54:32.070 --> 04:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
initial board for about 12 years from
 
04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
about 1999 to about 2012
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:44.550 --> 04:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
i am in opposition to this bill and i'll
 
04:54:46.310 --> 04:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
explain why
 
04:54:46.320 --> 04:54:49.350 align:start position:0%
explain why
um

04:54:49.350 --> 04:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:51.190 --> 04:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start off by showing you
 
04:54:53.350 --> 04:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
this chart that was put together by
 
04:54:53.360 --> 04:54:54.948 align:start position:0%
this chart that was put together by
nishala

04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
nishala
 
04:54:59.190 --> 04:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
and it's got 2004 and 2007.
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
and the reason why nishla the new
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire speech language hearing
 
04:55:04.150 --> 04:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
association put this chart together is
 
04:55:04.160 --> 04:55:05.270 align:start position:0%
association put this chart together is
because

04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:55:08.310 --> 04:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
there was so much confusion among who a
 
04:55:08.320 --> 04:55:09.590 align:start position:0%
there was so much confusion among who a
speech

04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
speech
 
04:55:12.470 --> 04:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
provider was in the public schools
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the different routes to
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
our avenues to getting that
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
certification or job in the school so to
 
04:55:22.150 --> 04:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
speak was extremely confusing to the
 
04:55:22.160 --> 04:55:23.350 align:start position:0%
speak was extremely confusing to the
consumer

04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
the people who are parents of children
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
who receive these services in schools
 
04:55:28.878 --> 04:55:30.150 align:start position:0%
who receive these services in schools
so

04:55:30.150 --> 04:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything here is similar i
 
04:55:32.878 --> 04:55:33.830 align:start position:0%
pretty much everything here is similar i
have

04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:55:35.270 --> 04:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
the qualifications for a speech
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
pathologist who is licensed under the
 
04:55:37.600 --> 04:55:38.708 align:start position:0%
pathologist who is licensed under the
governing

04:55:38.708 --> 04:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
governing
 
04:55:40.550 --> 04:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
department of allied health
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
the speech specialist under the
 
04:55:43.830 --> 04:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
04:55:46.230 --> 04:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
the alternative for that was
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
offered and i think still is as far as
 
04:55:50.390 --> 04:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
an avenue to get certified through the
 
04:55:51.670 --> 04:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
04:55:53.430 --> 04:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
and then speech language pathology
 
04:55:56.070 --> 04:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
assistance the only difference on here
 
04:55:58.470 --> 04:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
now is that
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
speech pathology assistants or speech
 
04:56:02.470 --> 04:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
assistants are now
 
04:56:02.480 --> 04:56:03.350 align:start position:0%
assistants are now
under

04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:56:05.430 --> 04:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
the governing the speech pathology
 
04:56:07.990 --> 04:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
governing board and regulated by them at
 
04:56:11.350 --> 04:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
the time this hadn't been um
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
official yet it was a pending so that's
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
different and you can have this
 
04:56:19.110 --> 04:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
up here talks about all the different
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
disorders or
 
04:56:20.798 --> 04:56:22.868 align:start position:0%
disorders or
speech

04:56:22.868 --> 04:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
speech
 
04:56:24.948 --> 04:56:24.958 align:start position:0%
disorders and diseases and
 
04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
issues that people work with
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
in the profession and it's not just
 
04:56:28.798 --> 04:56:29.910 align:start position:0%
in the profession and it's not just
schools

04:56:29.910 --> 04:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
it is in all areas however just to
 
04:56:33.280 --> 04:56:34.708 align:start position:0%
it is in all areas however just to
mention

04:56:34.708 --> 04:56:34.718 align:start position:0%
mention
 
04:56:37.030 --> 04:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
the school population
 
04:56:39.110 --> 04:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
is just inundated or has a high
 
04:56:41.670 --> 04:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
population of severely impaired children
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
that does require
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
a graduate degree in the area of
 
04:56:47.510 --> 04:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
communication sciences endorsed
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
disorders and speech pathology
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
so these are significant disorders and i
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
have them all listed here and i'll just
 
04:56:57.110 --> 04:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
as a summary there's things like
 
04:56:59.190 --> 04:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
neurogenic disorders like strokes
 
04:57:02.550 --> 04:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
aphasia swallowing
 
04:57:04.550 --> 04:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
augmentative communication
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
and um and these are children that that
 
04:57:08.150 --> 04:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
have these
 
04:57:09.990 --> 04:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
these disorders and disabilities in
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
schools as well but this is from way
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
back when and because
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:19.990 --> 04:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
routine calls from parents because they
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
would find out
 
04:57:24.868 --> 04:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
after a while that their child was not
 
04:57:26.868 --> 04:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
being treated or serviced or through
 
04:57:30.150 --> 04:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
their iep by a qualified professional
 
04:57:32.788 --> 04:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
and that qualified professional or that
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
qualified employee or that employee
 
04:57:38.230 --> 04:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
was the type of person that this bill is
 
04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
recommending to license it was a person
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
that had an undergraduate degree but did
 
04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
not have
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
a graduate degree that is considered
 
04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
the highest level of standard with the
 
04:57:51.990 --> 04:57:52.000 align:start position:0%

04:57:58.830 --> 04:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:01.110 --> 04:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
licensure um
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if you've i i got a
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
memorandum that is from vicki chester
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
lee that she
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
was had submitted i don't know if you're
 
04:58:13.110 --> 04:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with it
 
04:58:14.708 --> 04:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
04:58:14.718 --> 04:58:15.510 align:start position:0%
at this point
so

04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:17.910 --> 04:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
i know she's going to be here to testify
 
04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
and i went through her report
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
or her memorandum and i wanted to bring
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
up some points that i'm
 
04:58:26.708 --> 04:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
have learned with the research i have
 
04:58:26.718 --> 04:58:29.590 align:start position:0%
have learned with the research i have
done

04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:58:29.600 --> 04:58:35.110 align:start position:0%
done
and

04:58:35.110 --> 04:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
one of the points that i want to make on
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
this on her report
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
is that vicki is currently not on the
 
04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
board of the new hampshire speech
 
04:58:46.390 --> 04:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
language hearing association she has
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
been such as myself
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
but i have a concern that this is on
 
04:58:51.120 --> 04:58:52.310 align:start position:0%
but i have a concern that this is on
the

04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
nishla letterhead
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
however anishla executive board board
 
04:59:00.550 --> 04:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
member has not submitted this to this
 
04:59:00.560 --> 04:59:06.550 align:start position:0%
member has not submitted this to this
committee

04:59:06.550 --> 04:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
i know there's an amendment that was
 
04:59:08.400 --> 04:59:09.510 align:start position:0%
i know there's an amendment that was
done

04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:59:11.830 --> 04:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
and the department of ed is here to
 
04:59:14.230 --> 04:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
speak to that and what i know about that
 
04:59:16.470 --> 04:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
amendment is because
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
our national organization in asha saw
 
04:59:21.990 --> 04:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the original
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
house bill 106
 
04:59:26.948 --> 04:59:26.958 align:start position:0%
it brought grave concern because what
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's about to do is bring this back to
 
04:59:31.910 --> 04:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
the convolution that everybody has dealt
 
04:59:31.920 --> 04:59:32.948 align:start position:0%
the convolution that everybody has dealt
with

04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:59:37.190 --> 04:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
so a little bit of background that i
 
04:59:41.190 --> 04:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
want to clarify in the memorandum that
 
04:59:42.310 --> 04:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
is that yes in the 1970s the degree
 
04:59:47.670 --> 04:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
program was
 
04:59:49.350 --> 04:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
clinically based
 
04:59:49.360 --> 04:59:50.788 align:start position:0%
clinically based
and

04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
certification or working in public
 
04:59:55.350 --> 04:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
schools was
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
was typical and accepted
 
05:00:01.990 --> 05:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
i would a graduate degree and a master's
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
degree in speech pathology or
 
05:00:11.190 --> 05:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:14.708 --> 05:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
has been the required degree
 
05:00:17.910 --> 05:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
and this state has well over a thousand
 
05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
if not more
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
speech pathologists who are sort of who
 
05:00:21.520 --> 05:00:22.390 align:start position:0%
speech pathologists who are sort of who
are

05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
who have that degree who are working in
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
05:00:29.670 --> 05:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm saying 40 years
 
05:00:32.230 --> 05:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
has gone by where people who have a
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree had the decision to
 
05:00:37.030 --> 05:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
either get a graduate degree in speech
 
05:00:37.040 --> 05:00:38.310 align:start position:0%
either get a graduate degree in speech
pathology

05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
pathology
 
05:00:38.320 --> 05:00:39.350 align:start position:0%
pathology
or

05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
they can
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:00:50.708 --> 05:00:50.718 align:start position:0%
the and then this criteria that i have
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
down here to get admission into that
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
program so in the early 1990s licensure
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
was enacted in new hampshire so um
 
05:01:02.070 --> 05:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
from there is when there was a divide
 
05:01:03.510 --> 05:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
some of the people who were already
 
05:01:03.520 --> 05:01:04.708 align:start position:0%
some of the people who were already
currently

05:01:04.708 --> 05:01:04.718 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
certified in the public schools
 
05:01:08.948 --> 05:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
were not going to
 
05:01:10.708 --> 05:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
or not did not want to go under
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
licensure when it was enacted in the
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
early 90s i don't remember the exact
 
05:01:14.000 --> 05:01:15.110 align:start position:0%
early 90s i don't remember the exact
date

05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
date
 
05:01:16.948 --> 05:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
but they decided that they wanted to
 
05:01:18.628 --> 05:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
stay with the department of ed and be
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
certified under there and that is how
 
05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
the speech-language specialist
 
05:01:25.350 --> 05:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
nomenclature came about because they
 
05:01:26.868 --> 05:01:26.878 align:start position:0%
couldn't be called speech pathologists
 
05:01:28.390 --> 05:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
because of the other thing
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
so from 1996 to 2001 the university of
 
05:01:35.030 --> 05:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire provided a master's in
 
05:01:35.040 --> 05:01:36.150 align:start position:0%
new hampshire provided a master's in
science

05:01:36.150 --> 05:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
science
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
in teaching communication disorders due
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
to the ida requirements
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
so that the people who did have the
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
but did not have the master's degrees
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
were able to
 
05:01:53.190 --> 05:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
keep their jobs and sustain sustain
 
05:01:54.868 --> 05:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
their jobs in the school
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
so here's the program it no longer
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
exists because it's just gone by these
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
these people have the opportunity or it
 
05:02:04.628 --> 05:02:04.638 align:start position:0%
was put there for that very reason so
 
05:02:08.230 --> 05:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
here's the program that unh had that was
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
called the masters in teaching program
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
that would certify the sls
 
05:02:14.948 --> 05:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
many people took advantage of that many
 
05:02:17.270 --> 05:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
many people who took advantage of that
 
05:02:17.280 --> 05:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
many people who took advantage of that
program

05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
this had a bachelor's degree they got
 
05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
this degree
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
but that was well after
 
05:02:28.550 --> 05:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
the 1970s we're talking about in the
 
05:02:28.560 --> 05:02:30.070 align:start position:0%
the 1970s we're talking about in the
1990s

05:02:30.070 --> 05:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
1990s
 
05:02:31.830 --> 05:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
that people were doing this program
 
05:02:33.910 --> 05:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
taking this program so they're fairly
 
05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
recent graduates
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
but now we're talking about probably 30
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
years since the licensure has been acted
 
05:02:43.590 --> 05:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
the qualifications and the criteria has
 
05:02:43.600 --> 05:02:44.788 align:start position:0%
the qualifications and the criteria has
been

05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:02:44.798 --> 05:02:46.310 align:start position:0%
been
clearly

05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
established and if you look in the
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:55.670 --> 05:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
the um there's
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's thousands of speech pathologists
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
here that are working
 
05:03:01.750 --> 05:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
so this is not anything new
 
05:03:04.150 --> 05:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
the grad the undergraduate degrees the
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
people they don't even really exist
 
05:03:09.030 --> 05:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
anymore it's it's like a dinosaur
 
05:03:09.040 --> 05:03:10.310 align:start position:0%
anymore it's it's like a dinosaur
um

05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
so these this this degree cannot bridge
 
05:03:14.708 --> 05:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
over into the american speech language
 
05:03:17.590 --> 05:03:17.600 align:start position:0%
hearing association to get certified
 
05:03:19.430 --> 05:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and that was as recent as a
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
conversation with susan adams who
 
05:03:23.430 --> 05:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
participated in the amendment
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and just to clarify that because i
 
05:03:28.868 --> 05:03:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.350 --> 05:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
so that so so what i'm going to just
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
talk about is some of that's one part of
 
05:03:36.390 --> 05:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
the memorandum to clarify those dates
 
05:03:38.070 --> 05:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
and what has occurred and transpired
 
05:03:44.070 --> 05:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:46.708 --> 05:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
and then in paragraph two it's it states
 
05:03:46.718 --> 05:03:47.510 align:start position:0%
and then in paragraph two it's it states
to

05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
you can eliminate the endorsement that a
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
licensed slp and sls
 
05:03:53.910 --> 05:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
have the endorsement of the department
 
05:03:55.750 --> 05:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
of ed although it's not rigorously
 
05:03:55.760 --> 05:03:57.590 align:start position:0%
of ed although it's not rigorously
enforced

05:03:57.590 --> 05:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%

that's here
 
05:04:02.400 --> 05:04:03.350 align:start position:0%
that's here
we

we
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:09.910 --> 05:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
their rsa that anybody who holds a

pathology shall be considered to have
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
met the requirements never in my over 25
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
26 whatever years i've been working have
 
05:04:26.788 --> 05:04:26.798 align:start position:0%
i ever had to get certified as a speech
 
05:04:26.798 --> 05:04:28.070 align:start position:0%
i ever had to get certified as a speech

05:04:28.070 --> 05:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:04:29.830 --> 05:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
specialist at the school i've only had
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
to have the speech pathology because
 
05:04:35.110 --> 05:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
that was the the optimal
 
05:04:35.120 --> 05:04:36.070 align:start position:0%
that was the the optimal
um

05:04:36.070 --> 05:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:36.080 --> 05:04:37.590 align:start position:0%
um
certification

05:04:37.590 --> 05:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:04:40.150 --> 05:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
to work in the school
 
05:04:42.788 --> 05:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
so that that's in here and it's it's not
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
a fact it's not true it doesn't have to
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
happen it's not something that has
 
05:04:46.400 --> 05:04:47.830 align:start position:0%
happen it's not something that has
happened

05:04:47.830 --> 05:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
happened
 
05:04:47.840 --> 05:04:52.390 align:start position:0%
happened
um

05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:55.990 --> 05:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
the other part one of the um
 
05:04:58.830 --> 05:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:02.550 --> 05:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
um to this memorandum
 
05:05:02.560 --> 05:05:03.990 align:start position:0%
um to this memorandum
um

05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:06.868 --> 05:05:06.878 align:start position:0%
it that that was to require the meets um
 
05:05:09.030 --> 05:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
the requirements for that on paragraph
 
05:05:09.040 --> 05:05:10.310 align:start position:0%
the requirements for that on paragraph
three

05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:05:10.320 --> 05:05:11.670 align:start position:0%
three
um

05:05:11.670 --> 05:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:14.788 --> 05:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
i'm just stating that it was says asha
 
05:05:16.708 --> 05:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
has objected to licensing these
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
individuals the individuals are these
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
undergraduate people
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
who this bill is trying to
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
allow to be licensed with degrees that
 
05:05:31.350 --> 05:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
are maybe in reading early childhood
 
05:05:32.948 --> 05:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
special education
 
05:05:35.430 --> 05:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
those types of things not
 
05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
a master of science degree and
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
communication disorders
 
05:05:41.350 --> 05:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll just tell you my experiences as
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
i see children because i work with very
 
05:05:45.190 --> 05:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
young children i would work with all
 
05:05:45.200 --> 05:05:46.310 align:start position:0%
young children i would work with all
ages

05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
ages
 
05:05:48.390 --> 05:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
but when they are not treated by a
 
05:05:51.430 --> 05:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
person who has the competency
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
they're not making the gains in progress
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
and parents don't even know who these
 
05:06:00.550 --> 05:06:00.560 align:start position:0%
people are or their qualifications
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
very often
 
05:06:04.390 --> 05:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
but to bring about
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
allowing licensed people
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
to allowing these
 
05:06:11.110 --> 05:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
undergraduates to be licensed and then
 
05:06:12.788 --> 05:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
say they're licensed
 
05:06:14.230 --> 05:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
now when they
 
05:06:17.590 --> 05:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
when parents are in an iep meeting
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
and they think this person is licensed
 
05:06:22.788 --> 05:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's actually deceiving when they don't
 
05:06:24.390 --> 05:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
have the same
 
05:06:29.430 --> 05:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
degree and expertise and knowledge that
 
05:06:29.440 --> 05:06:30.708 align:start position:0%
degree and expertise and knowledge that
the

05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:30.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:06:34.708 --> 05:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
slp has maybe in this district's next
 
05:06:34.718 --> 05:06:35.750 align:start position:0%
slp has maybe in this district's next
building

05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
building
 
05:06:39.270 --> 05:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
so this is very very gray
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to just confuse the public
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
and it's not protecting the consumer
 
05:06:46.718 --> 05:06:55.350 align:start position:0%
and it's not protecting the consumer
um

05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:58.868 --> 05:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
so i am not in support of this bill
 
05:06:58.878 --> 05:07:00.070 align:start position:0%
so i am not in support of this bill
because

05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
the educational and academic internship
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
training is not the same
 
05:07:08.788 --> 05:07:08.798 align:start position:0%
as as in an undergraduate undergraduate
 
05:07:08.798 --> 05:07:09.990 align:start position:0%
as as in an undergraduate undergraduate
degree

05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
degree
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
with an educational master's degree
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
described in the memorandum by victoria
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
chester lee
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
the count of
 
05:07:18.878 --> 05:07:21.750 align:start position:0%
the count of

05:07:21.750 --> 05:07:21.760 align:start position:0%

05:07:23.600 --> 05:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
center for medicaid
and

05:07:24.550 --> 05:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:24.560 --> 05:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
and
medicare

05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
medicare
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
their rules
 
05:07:29.510 --> 05:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
that you can review
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
require that
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
the person is qualified the quiet the
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
qualified person
 
05:07:39.190 --> 05:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
has these degrees
 
05:07:41.110 --> 05:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
they have these higher degrees that i'm
 
05:07:42.868 --> 05:07:42.878 align:start position:0%
mentioning to you right now that is by
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
medicaid for schools
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
and medicaid
 
05:07:49.910 --> 05:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
by the federal government
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
so i don't understand how a person with
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
an undergraduate degree without the
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
higher standard of the graduate degree
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
is actually going to be able to
 
05:08:03.430 --> 05:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
fulfill the medicaid requirement maybe
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's something i need to learn but i'm
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
just going by the documentation
 
05:08:08.160 --> 05:08:09.110 align:start position:0%
just going by the documentation
from

05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:08:13.830 --> 05:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:13.840 --> 05:08:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:20.070 --> 05:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
um medicaid to schools only began
 
05:08:21.510 --> 05:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
probably in the
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
late 1990s when i was working as a
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
school slp
 
05:08:28.788 --> 05:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
so that has been fairly recent meaning
 
05:08:32.150 --> 05:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
that by that time these undergraduate
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
people whoever aware they are
 
05:08:37.270 --> 05:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
if they were working under another
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
capacity or with a different degree
 
05:08:42.390 --> 05:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
a speech pathologist with an asha
 
05:08:45.430 --> 05:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
certification and licensure would sign
 
05:08:45.440 --> 05:08:47.430 align:start position:0%
certification and licensure would sign
their

05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:08:47.440 --> 05:08:49.190 align:start position:0%
their
their

05:08:49.190 --> 05:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:08:52.310 --> 05:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
documentation for delivery of services
 
05:08:54.868 --> 05:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
and the school would receive their
 
05:08:58.550 --> 05:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
medicaid funds for that child
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
but it had to be signed off by the
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
qualified provider which was
 
05:09:04.708 --> 05:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
the asha certified that i've said a
 
05:09:06.310 --> 05:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
million times that you might be tired of
 
05:09:06.320 --> 05:09:07.510 align:start position:0%
million times that you might be tired of
hearing

05:09:07.510 --> 05:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:09:07.520 --> 05:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
hearing
um

05:09:08.550 --> 05:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:08.560 --> 05:09:10.150 align:start position:0%
um
anyway

05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
so that that is that is not new i mean
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
this has been the past 30 years i don't
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
know where these undergraduates who from
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
the 1970s are coming from who are not
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
where they are i mean
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're retired but
 
05:09:26.788 --> 05:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
in any case um
 
05:09:26.798 --> 05:09:27.750 align:start position:0%
in any case um
um

05:09:27.750 --> 05:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know the the we these people that
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
in europe to see to
 
05:09:41.270 --> 05:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
adhere that people are going to be
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
protected and that they get the right
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
service deliveries
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is that i looked at
 
05:09:49.670 --> 05:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
the counterparts of my team members
 
05:09:51.270 --> 05:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
which are occupational therapists
 
05:09:52.788 --> 05:09:52.798 align:start position:0%
physical therapists
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
and they have pretty stringent
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines for reimbursement for
 
05:09:56.160 --> 05:09:57.270 align:start position:0%
guidelines for reimbursement for
medicaid

05:09:57.270 --> 05:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
05:10:00.070 --> 05:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
and there isn't anything that says that
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
a you know physical ed teacher could do
 
05:10:02.958 --> 05:10:04.070 align:start position:0%
a you know physical ed teacher could do
pt

05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
pt
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid reimbursement or something of
 
05:10:08.550 --> 05:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
that example
 
05:10:08.560 --> 05:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
that example
i

05:10:10.310 --> 05:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:10:13.270 --> 05:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
i think that it is uh
 
05:10:15.990 --> 05:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of progress because i understand
 
05:10:17.110 --> 05:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
there's somebody from the department of
 
05:10:19.110 --> 05:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
ed that's going to speak here in favor
 
05:10:19.120 --> 05:10:19.830 align:start position:0%
ed that's going to speak here in favor
of

05:10:19.830 --> 05:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
this and maybe
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
i heard supporting eliminating the
 
05:10:26.390 --> 05:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
speech specialist
 
05:10:26.400 --> 05:10:27.350 align:start position:0%
speech specialist
um

05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:30.628 --> 05:10:30.638 align:start position:0%
certification under the department of ed
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
and it that i would wholeheartedly agree
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
with and i think that it's there should
 
05:10:39.030 --> 05:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
be less convolution and i know that
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
ashes supports having only one body
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
be in the state
 
05:10:46.708 --> 05:10:46.718 align:start position:0%
to um be certified or
 
05:10:48.230 --> 05:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
the credentialed person for this
 
05:10:48.240 --> 05:10:49.590 align:start position:0%
the credentialed person for this
position

05:10:49.590 --> 05:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:10:51.670 --> 05:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
but as i said i was on a committee a
 
05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
long time ago i know the department of
 
05:10:56.150 --> 05:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
it has a lot of changes in there with
 
05:10:59.750 --> 05:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
different people who are no longer there
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
but my
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
experience is that the allied health and
 
05:11:05.590 --> 05:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
department of ed have never worked
 
05:11:05.600 --> 05:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
department of ed have never worked
together

05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:11:09.270 --> 05:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's gonna
 
05:11:09.280 --> 05:11:11.270 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's gonna
be

05:11:11.270 --> 05:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
quite an endeavor
 
05:11:13.840 --> 05:11:15.670 align:start position:0%
quite an endeavor
for

05:11:15.670 --> 05:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:11:17.590 --> 05:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
the department of eds who
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
relinquished this certification and i
 
05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
also know that they've held on to it
 
05:11:24.550 --> 05:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
they've loved it
 
05:11:27.190 --> 05:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
and i i'd be surprised if they if they
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
actually if this changes but that would
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
be a good thing
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think it should be at the
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:38.948 --> 05:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh the undergraduate
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
who you
 
05:11:43.030 --> 05:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
i don't have the requirements for an
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
undergraduate degree with me but you can
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
easily find them on the unh website but
 
05:11:50.230 --> 05:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
their coursework
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
is just very basic
 
05:11:55.350 --> 05:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
and their degrees in another area does
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
not touch upon any of these
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
criteria or disorders that are happening
 
05:12:03.990 --> 05:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the public schools
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
i have these papers that i can give to
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
05:12:10.150 --> 05:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i can leave them with you
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
and other documentations that i refer to
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the cms rules
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
and i if
 
05:12:19.350 --> 05:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
i strongly suggest that
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
you review this carefully
 
05:12:23.830 --> 05:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
if you know anybody in the profession
 
05:12:26.948 --> 05:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
a neighbor or a relative
 
05:12:29.990 --> 05:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
i would ask them their opinion before
 
05:12:32.708 --> 05:12:32.718 align:start position:0%
this huge change takes place
 
05:12:34.628 --> 05:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
and people like myself have to start
 
05:12:34.638 --> 05:12:36.230 align:start position:0%
and people like myself have to start
re-explaining

05:12:36.230 --> 05:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
re-explaining
 
05:12:39.030 --> 05:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
why they have a person who's not
 
05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
qualified working with their child
 
05:12:43.120 --> 05:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
qualified working with their child
um

05:12:43.990 --> 05:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the opportunity and if
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i actually don't
 
05:12:56.550 --> 05:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
have a question if i could just have one
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
second that might clear up um
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
a few things
 
05:13:02.150 --> 05:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
actually just one thing
 
05:13:03.430 --> 05:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned
 
05:13:05.510 --> 05:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools a lot
 
05:13:05.520 --> 05:13:06.550 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools a lot
and

05:13:06.550 --> 05:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:08.470 --> 05:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
prior to me being elected to be a state
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative i i actually worked in
 
05:13:12.868 --> 05:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
the special education department at a
 
05:13:14.948 --> 05:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
local school district and one of the
 
05:13:17.590 --> 05:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
jobs i had there was actually being the
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid coordinator
 
05:13:20.788 --> 05:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
god help me
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:25.200 --> 05:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:13:26.470 --> 05:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:29.030 --> 05:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
for those of you that don't know uh
 
05:13:30.868 --> 05:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
the testimony she gave is actually you
 
05:13:32.550 --> 05:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
know very much correct that you you did
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
these these professions had
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
professionals had to be licensed in
 
05:13:41.590 --> 05:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
order to sign off on these special
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
education services in order for the
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
schools to be reimbursed
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
and then i believe
 
05:13:49.110 --> 05:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
i want to say was three years ago it was
 
05:13:50.948 --> 05:13:50.958 align:start position:0%
at least two years ago
 
05:13:52.390 --> 05:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
that there was actually
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
a massive change that was met that was
 
05:13:56.788 --> 05:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
made to the medicaid to schools program
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
where it was no longer able to just be
 
05:14:01.350 --> 05:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
you know the speech pathologist signing
 
05:14:04.788 --> 05:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
off on the paraprofessionals or her coda
 
05:14:06.550 --> 05:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
it actually became where you actually
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
had to have a doctor a registered nurse
 
05:14:12.310 --> 05:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
practitioner um signing off on these
 
05:14:14.310 --> 05:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
on these ieps and
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
yes it
 
05:14:17.750 --> 05:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
it it created a little bit of of
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
confusion on
 
05:14:22.390 --> 05:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
so just wanted to to kind of clarify
 
05:14:26.390 --> 05:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
the question was would you agree that
 
05:14:30.628 --> 05:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
i tried to say in the beginning was more
 
05:14:34.150 --> 05:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
of a statement would you agree that that
 
05:14:35.510 --> 05:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
has created some confusion for the
 
05:14:38.628 --> 05:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools program
 
05:14:40.550 --> 05:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
well yeah bless you for that doing that
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
job because doing the whole
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
doing medicaid to schools is completely
 
05:14:45.920 --> 05:14:47.830 align:start position:0%
doing medicaid to schools is completely
confusing

05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i would agree with what you're
 
05:14:49.040 --> 05:14:50.070 align:start position:0%
yeah i would agree with what you're
saying

05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:14:53.830 --> 05:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
i also am a medicaid provider as a as a
 
05:14:56.310 --> 05:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
private practitioner i have a lot of
 
05:14:58.390 --> 05:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
experience with
 
05:15:00.628 --> 05:15:00.638 align:start position:0%
commercial reimbursement
 
05:15:03.590 --> 05:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
for um people that come in for treatment
 
05:15:04.868 --> 05:15:04.878 align:start position:0%
through their commercial insurance
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
companies i forgot to add that
 
05:15:07.760 --> 05:15:09.670 align:start position:0%
companies i forgot to add that
uh

05:15:09.670 --> 05:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
a license and with the different
 
05:15:14.948 --> 05:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
background how is that gonna work when
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
they when they require a commercial
 
05:15:19.030 --> 05:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
05:15:19.040 --> 05:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
insurance company
medicaid

05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:23.670 --> 05:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment as a provider in the state of
 
05:15:24.788 --> 05:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
well i'm licensed and i have other you
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
know other certificate my other
 
05:15:29.280 --> 05:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
know other certificate my other
certification

05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
certification
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
but how is that going to
 
05:15:35.670 --> 05:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
be delineated for somebody who's
 
05:15:39.270 --> 05:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
licensed with the undergraduate degree
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
how is that going to be able to be i'm
 
05:15:43.510 --> 05:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
just bringing it out rhetorically but
 
05:15:45.350 --> 05:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
how is that going to be
 
05:15:48.390 --> 05:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
monitored how how i realized that the
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
amendment has some really good
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place
 
05:15:54.240 --> 05:15:55.350 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place
but

05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
i've been on the licensing board i mean
 
05:15:59.430 --> 05:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
even that's hard to monitor people
 
05:15:59.440 --> 05:16:02.708 align:start position:0%
even that's hard to monitor people
so

05:16:02.708 --> 05:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
if i may mr chairman i
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure if i'm
 
05:16:10.708 --> 05:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly not an expert in this in
 
05:16:13.110 --> 05:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
this field um
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately our school that i that
 
05:16:17.830 --> 05:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
i worked with ended up doing away with
 
05:16:20.070 --> 05:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
the medicaid to schools program but if
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
if i'm not
 
05:16:21.520 --> 05:16:23.030 align:start position:0%
if i'm not
mistaken

05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
basically what happened with the other
 
05:16:27.590 --> 05:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
schools in the area that kept it
 
05:16:30.310 --> 05:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
they actually hired
 
05:16:32.230 --> 05:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
registered nurse practitioners to come
 
05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
in or or some physicians some of them
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
actually came in you know our school
 
05:16:38.708 --> 05:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
meets on tuesdays for their special
 
05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
education meetings so those particular
 
05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
professionals would actually come in and
 
05:16:42.958 --> 05:16:44.230 align:start position:0%
professionals would actually come in and
sit

05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
sit
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
for the special education meeting
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore they'd be able to sign off
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
that yes these services are required
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
is basically how it ended up going and
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
then after that
 
05:16:59.190 --> 05:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
other schools are basically
 
05:17:03.590 --> 05:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
emailing and or faxing the iep to
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
the medical professional they're signing
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
off yes these these services are
 
05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
required and then from there i believe
 
05:17:11.590 --> 05:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
you know in this case the speech
 
05:17:14.788 --> 05:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
pathologist is then able to sign off
 
05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
saying yes they received the services
 
05:17:19.590 --> 05:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
that this doctor has agreed
 
05:17:21.910 --> 05:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
is needed in order to be reimbursed to
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
the medicaid to schools program did i
 
05:17:25.350 --> 05:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
answer your question
 
05:17:26.628 --> 05:17:26.638 align:start position:0%
well partly
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
first of all i think the practice act
 
05:17:30.788 --> 05:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
for speech pathology allows the speech
 
05:17:32.708 --> 05:17:32.718 align:start position:0%
pathologist to not require an ordering
 
05:17:32.718 --> 05:17:33.220 align:start position:0%
pathologist to not require an ordering
physician

05:17:33.220 --> 05:17:33.230 align:start position:0%
physician
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:34.788 align:start position:0%
physician
[Music]

05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:17:36.788 --> 05:17:36.798 align:start position:0%
although i have to take that back that
 
05:17:39.030 --> 05:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's medicaid they do so they need to
 
05:17:41.350 --> 05:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
have the pcp
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
as i'm thinking that's correct
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
other commercial insurances don't um
 
05:17:48.788 --> 05:17:48.798 align:start position:0%
what i was bringing about is that
 
05:17:50.390 --> 05:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
um now that
 
05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
if the undergraduate person is licensed
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
as a just a licensed
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
clinician under the governing board
 
05:18:02.160 --> 05:18:03.270 align:start position:0%
clinician under the governing board
that

05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:05.590 --> 05:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
gives them the
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
um credential
 
05:18:08.240 --> 05:18:09.350 align:start position:0%
um credential
to

05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
not just do medicaid or sign off or on
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools and actually you're
 
05:18:15.350 --> 05:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
saying that we need to have the
 
05:18:17.430 --> 05:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
physician anyway no
 
05:18:17.440 --> 05:18:19.590 align:start position:0%
physician anyway no
okay

05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:18:21.510 --> 05:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
well anyway mike my other person my
 
05:18:21.520 --> 05:18:22.550 align:start position:0%
well anyway mike my other person my
other

05:18:22.550 --> 05:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
point on this is aside from medicaid to
 
05:18:27.270 --> 05:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
schools and working in a school if the
 
05:18:30.230 --> 05:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
license is convoluted that you have a
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
a speech pathologist who has the
 
05:18:33.750 --> 05:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
graduate degree
 
05:18:35.670 --> 05:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
of the highest level degree and then you
 
05:18:35.680 --> 05:18:36.628 align:start position:0%
of the highest level degree and then you
have

05:18:36.628 --> 05:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
a speech licensed speech pathologist who
 
05:18:41.910 --> 05:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
has an undergraduate degree that has
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
minimal minimal minimal
 
05:18:44.080 --> 05:18:45.510 align:start position:0%
minimal minimal minimal
requirements

05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:18:48.070 --> 05:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to fulfill the job and a
 
05:18:50.550 --> 05:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
degree in reading or something how is
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
that going to be delineated to the
 
05:18:52.080 --> 05:18:53.590 align:start position:0%
that going to be delineated to the
public

05:18:53.590 --> 05:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:18:56.550 --> 05:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
if they both have a license
 
05:18:58.628 --> 05:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
i don't have to show my license to
 
05:18:58.638 --> 05:18:59.750 align:start position:0%
i don't have to show my license to
anybody

05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
05:19:01.670 --> 05:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a special color to it
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
that says i've got this degree and this
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
person doesn't have that degree i have
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
to provide that license number through
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
other means
 
05:19:13.430 --> 05:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
to so that and then they can verify it
 
05:19:16.470 --> 05:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
but that's that's a lot of a lot of um
 
05:19:17.910 --> 05:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
red tape or
 
05:19:20.550 --> 05:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
layers to go through to to to prove that
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's actually licensed with a
 
05:19:24.390 --> 05:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
qualified degree
 
05:19:24.400 --> 05:19:25.350 align:start position:0%
qualified degree
um

05:19:25.350 --> 05:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:26.830 --> 05:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:19:29.590 --> 05:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
think i don't know if anybody's provided
 
05:19:31.110 --> 05:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
the qualifications for the master's
 
05:19:32.230 --> 05:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
level degree i don't know if there's
 
05:19:34.628 --> 05:19:34.638 align:start position:0%
time to do that after this committee i
 
05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that i've actually put
 
05:19:38.310 --> 05:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
things together
 
05:19:40.628 --> 05:19:40.638 align:start position:0%
very quickly i work like five days a
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
week 12 hours a day
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
and i've got a typos on here that i'm
 
05:19:46.868 --> 05:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
going to fix up and give back to you but
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you these documents
 
05:19:49.040 --> 05:19:49.990 align:start position:0%
and i'll give you these documents
but

05:19:49.990 --> 05:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:19:51.990 --> 05:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
those are the questions that i have and
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
the reason why i have them is because
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
those are the questions that i had to
 
05:19:58.150 --> 05:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
answer and find out about and i know
 
05:19:59.590 --> 05:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
that people will be coming into my
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
office asking me what does this mean
 
05:20:02.878 --> 05:20:04.550 align:start position:0%
office asking me what does this mean
and

05:20:04.550 --> 05:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:07.350 --> 05:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
it's something to be strongly
 
05:20:07.360 --> 05:20:08.628 align:start position:0%
it's something to be strongly
considered

05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
considered
 
05:20:08.638 --> 05:20:09.670 align:start position:0%
considered
before

05:20:09.670 --> 05:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:20:12.070 --> 05:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
agreeing to this and finding out exactly
 
05:20:15.030 --> 05:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
how it will affect everything
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
with the consumer
 
05:20:18.550 --> 05:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what the licensing board is
 
05:20:21.110 --> 05:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
about to protect the consumer
 
05:20:22.708 --> 05:20:22.718 align:start position:0%
any other questions i appreciate your
 
05:20:24.628 --> 05:20:24.638 align:start position:0%
testimony thanks on this matter thank
 
05:20:26.548 --> 05:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
you thanks
 
05:20:28.628 --> 05:20:28.638 align:start position:0%
if i can have a moment with um
 
05:20:31.510 --> 05:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire i i there's no
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
one's going to be shocked here that i
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
have a direct line to the chairman of
 
05:20:35.750 --> 05:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh since he since he's my father um
 
05:20:41.270 --> 05:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
and they are willing to take this
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill this this to me
 
05:20:45.110 --> 05:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
appears to be not really about licensing
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
but about qualifications under our
 
05:21:20.708 --> 05:21:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:30.470 --> 05:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i apologize for
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
not having written testimony i was not
 
05:21:33.910 --> 05:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
originally going to testify but i
 
05:21:36.548 --> 05:21:36.558 align:start position:0%
decided i needed to
 
05:21:39.270 --> 05:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
i am speaking in opposition to house
 
05:21:42.150 --> 05:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
bill 1016 as originally drafted in
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
support of amendment 0091h
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
which was my attempt to rewrite the bill
 
05:21:52.390 --> 05:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to tell you guys a story
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
i can't believe how old i am
 
05:21:57.430 --> 05:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
34 years ago my oldest daughter was born
 
05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
in wolfeboro
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
and like most young parents we brought
 
05:22:04.150 --> 05:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
her to the public school to begin her
 
05:22:06.390 --> 05:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
educational process
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
when becky went to public school i'm
 
05:22:10.548 --> 05:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't intend to put her name
 
05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
into the record
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
when my oldest daughter went into the
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
public school the only person in the
 
05:22:17.510 --> 05:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
world who could understand what she said
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
was her older brother
 
05:22:22.470 --> 05:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
she worked with a speech specialist at
 
05:22:24.708 --> 05:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
the school over the course of her first
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
year there in kindergarten
 
05:22:30.070 --> 05:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the year she really
 
05:22:32.548 --> 05:22:32.558 align:start position:0%
had not made any progress and we were
 
05:22:36.628 --> 05:22:36.638 align:start position:0%
given the choice of the iep process
 
05:22:39.430 --> 05:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we said no
 
05:22:39.440 --> 05:22:40.230 align:start position:0%
and we said no
we

05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
removed her from the system
 
05:22:44.868 --> 05:22:44.878 align:start position:0%
we found ourselves a speech-language
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
pathologist in sanford maine who had the
 
05:22:47.760 --> 05:22:49.110 align:start position:0%
pathologist in sanford maine who had the
credentials

05:22:49.110 --> 05:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
05:22:50.948 --> 05:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
who diagnosed my daughter as having
 
05:22:52.628 --> 05:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
exceedingly rare condition known as
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
speech apraxia and she worked with her
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
over the course of a great many years
 
05:23:00.310 --> 05:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the time
 
05:23:02.628 --> 05:23:02.638 align:start position:0%
my daughter successfully we graduated
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
her from home school
 
05:23:06.070 --> 05:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
she went to connecticut college where
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
she graduated on the dean's list
 
05:23:10.310 --> 05:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
she now runs her own business in the
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
state of massachusetts
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh she does theater lights
 
05:23:16.070 --> 05:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
and she's a fully functional member of
 
05:23:16.080 --> 05:23:17.350 align:start position:0%
and she's a fully functional member of
society

05:23:17.350 --> 05:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
society
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
i did that entirely on my dime we didn't
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
ask for the taxpayers dollar to do that
 
05:23:25.270 --> 05:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
it's important to me that we protect the
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
credential of speech-language
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
pathologists because i needed to find
 
05:23:31.670 --> 05:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
someone with qualifications to help my
 
05:23:31.680 --> 05:23:33.270 align:start position:0%
someone with qualifications to help my
daughter

05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
05:23:35.350 --> 05:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
and the school didn't do that
 
05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the person in the school is
 
05:23:39.430 --> 05:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
capable of taking care of all sorts of
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
things that were really common she had
 
05:23:43.270 --> 05:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
experience with but she was not
 
05:23:45.750 --> 05:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
a fully qualified individual
 
05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
the speech-language pathologist
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
eventually went on to become the speech
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
language pathologist at our local
 
05:23:52.470 --> 05:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
hospital where i'm a trustee
 
05:23:53.670 --> 05:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
and there are now many more
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
speech-language pathologists uh in the
 
05:23:56.868 --> 05:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire than there were
 
05:23:57.990 --> 05:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
my daughter's 34 now like i said i can't
 
05:24:02.868 --> 05:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
believe how old i am
 
05:24:04.548 --> 05:24:04.558 align:start position:0%
consequently i worked with attorney
 
05:24:07.430 --> 05:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
adams and ols to draft or redraft the
 
05:24:07.440 --> 05:24:08.390 align:start position:0%
adams and ols to draft or redraft the
bill

05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
in a way that would preserve the
 
05:24:12.548 --> 05:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
speech-language pathologist credential
 
05:24:14.390 --> 05:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
would allow us to
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
not violate the interstate compact which
 
05:24:18.788 --> 05:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
has now become
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
established law in the state of new
 
05:24:20.160 --> 05:24:21.190 align:start position:0%
established law in the state of new
hampshire

05:24:21.190 --> 05:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:24:22.708 --> 05:24:22.718 align:start position:0%
and would allow speech language
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
specialists to continue to do what they
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
are doing they can take care of common
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
things and they are providing a service
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
in the schools but they are not
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
speech-language pathologists and we need
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
and uh with that i'll conclude my
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'll be glad to take
 
05:24:38.798 --> 05:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'll be glad to take
questions

05:24:41.190 --> 05:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:24:42.310 --> 05:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative march
 
05:24:43.830 --> 05:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you so i'm
 
05:24:47.590 --> 05:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
glad things worked out for your daughter
 
05:24:47.600 --> 05:24:48.830 align:start position:0%
glad things worked out for your daughter
my

05:24:48.830 --> 05:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:24:48.840 --> 05:24:50.548 align:start position:0%
my
question

05:24:50.548 --> 05:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
is would
 
05:24:54.628 --> 05:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
would this amendment
 
05:24:57.670 --> 05:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
end up requiring that um
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
the people providing speech therapy in
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
the schools be
 
05:25:03.030 --> 05:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know the fully qualified speech
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
language pathologist if because if so my
 
05:25:06.788 --> 05:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
if the
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
people who were in the schools at the
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
time your daughter was having the issue
 
05:25:14.390 --> 05:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
are qualified to handle most things
 
05:25:15.990 --> 05:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
05:25:19.190 --> 05:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to require all of them have
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
greater qualifications when it might be
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
possible maybe the school should
 
05:25:24.310 --> 05:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
arrange some something else for your
 
05:25:26.470 --> 05:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
daughter to
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
find an appropriate person to help but
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
if they're not needed from
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the kids with
 
05:25:32.548 --> 05:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
problems is that really the right thing
 
05:25:34.948 --> 05:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
to do i i think that's a fair question
 
05:25:34.958 --> 05:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
to do i i think that's a fair question
um

05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:38.070 --> 05:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
i do worry about misdiagnosis i mean not
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
everybody has the wherewithal to
 
05:25:40.638 --> 05:25:42.310 align:start position:0%
everybody has the wherewithal to
basically

05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:25:44.390 --> 05:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
stick their finger at the system and and
 
05:25:46.150 --> 05:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
take their take it under their own
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility i'm i'm very happy for my
 
05:25:49.830 --> 05:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
daughter that we were able to do that
 
05:25:52.708 --> 05:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
for her and and i i worry that there are
 
05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
others in this world who could have been
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
in the same situation
 
05:25:59.430 --> 05:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
and not had that opportunity
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
we tried to strike a compromise such
 
05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
that the people who are currently
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
working in the schools would be able to
 
05:26:05.750 --> 05:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
continue working in the schools but the
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
new hires would have the
 
05:26:10.230 --> 05:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh credentials that are now much more
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
available than they were at the time
 
05:26:13.750 --> 05:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
because that seemed like a reasonable
 
05:26:15.990 --> 05:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
compromise i'm certainly amenable to
 
05:26:17.670 --> 05:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
hearing some other amendment if you have
 
05:26:19.190 --> 05:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
some better compromise you wish to
 
05:26:19.200 --> 05:26:20.310 align:start position:0%
some better compromise you wish to
propose

05:26:20.310 --> 05:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
propose
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:29.110 --> 05:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative marshall can you it it
 
05:26:31.670 --> 05:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
seems a little confusing to me
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:41.510 --> 05:26:41.520 align:start position:0%

so

05:26:58.070 --> 05:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative if you could give me a
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
page in line of what you're referring to
 
05:27:04.070 --> 05:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
then i could refer to what you're this
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
is at the very beginning of the bill
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's line three the bill is
 
05:27:09.120 --> 05:27:10.868 align:start position:0%
you know it's line three the bill is
drafted

05:27:10.868 --> 05:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
05:27:12.868 --> 05:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
introduced yes that's the only thing i
 
05:27:15.270 --> 05:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
have a copy of i'm sorry i have more
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
amendments in my folder and perhaps
 
05:27:20.150 --> 05:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt will hand you one
 
05:27:21.510 --> 05:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
i passed them out to the committee
 
05:27:23.350 --> 05:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
earlier today but perhaps i you weren't
 
05:27:24.470 --> 05:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
here at the time and i didn't get you
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
well let me see if i can put it this way
 
05:27:30.070 --> 05:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
so do you know the degree requirements
 
05:27:33.430 --> 05:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
for a speech language pathologist is
 
05:27:36.548 --> 05:27:36.558 align:start position:0%
does that require a master's degree
 
05:27:38.150 --> 05:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh there are people in the room who can
 
05:27:39.990 --> 05:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
answer that question better than i and
 
05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
yes there is a difference in the
 
05:27:41.200 --> 05:27:44.070 align:start position:0%
yes there is a difference in the
credentials

05:27:44.070 --> 05:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:44.080 --> 05:27:45.270 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:45.280 --> 05:27:46.788 align:start position:0%

yes thank you so since i saw nodding
heads

05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
heads
 
05:27:53.990 --> 05:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
if we're going to issue
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense to me
 
05:27:58.948 --> 05:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
that i i don't even believe there's a is
 
05:28:00.628 --> 05:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
there such a thing as a bachelor's
 
05:28:03.670 --> 05:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
degree in speech language pathology i'm
 
05:28:05.110 --> 05:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
just thinking that it's probably a
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
master's degree but i don't know
 
05:28:09.670 --> 05:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's my dilemma i agree with you that
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
the language in the original bill was
 
05:28:14.150 --> 05:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
incredibly confusing and that was
 
05:28:15.830 --> 05:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
one of the motivations behind my
 
05:28:17.670 --> 05:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
amendment which i think you now have in
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%

05:28:19.200 --> 05:28:23.510 align:start position:0%

05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
study this amendment to see if i can
 
05:28:28.708 --> 05:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
figure this out
 
05:28:36.708 --> 05:28:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:38.230 --> 05:28:38.240 align:start position:0%

the issues that i'm hoping will resolve
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
by the passage of the amendment to hb
 
05:31:06.628 --> 05:31:06.638 align:start position:0%

speech-language pathology services in

new hampshire into the office
 
05:31:16.708 --> 05:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
of licensed allied health professionals
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
having two agencies dealing with the
 
05:31:21.270 --> 05:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
same profession has caused confusion
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the public and to the profession
 
05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would also relieve the
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
05:31:30.310 --> 05:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
from the necessity of requiring licensed
 
05:31:32.470 --> 05:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
speech-language pathologists to also
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
hold the speech-language specialist
 
05:31:34.080 --> 05:31:35.270 align:start position:0%
hold the speech-language specialist
endorsement

05:31:35.270 --> 05:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
endorsement
 
05:31:37.190 --> 05:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the associated monitoring of that
 
05:31:37.200 --> 05:31:38.948 align:start position:0%
and the associated monitoring of that
endorsement

05:31:38.948 --> 05:31:38.958 align:start position:0%
endorsement
 
05:31:41.190 --> 05:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
an issue that arose was the conflict
 
05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
with the audiology speech-language
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
pathology interstate compact
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
which was passed when this
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
initiative was being developed it is
 
05:31:51.990 --> 05:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
exceptionally important that new
 
05:31:54.390 --> 05:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire comply with the requirements
 
05:31:56.548 --> 05:31:56.558 align:start position:0%
of the compact and the american speech
 
05:31:59.030 --> 05:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
and hearing association
 
05:32:01.350 --> 05:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
has suggested that a new license be
 
05:32:04.390 --> 05:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
issued for speech language specialists
 
05:32:06.070 --> 05:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
so that it would be a speech language
 
05:32:09.350 --> 05:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
specialist license administered through
 
05:32:11.350 --> 05:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
the allied health
 
05:32:12.470 --> 05:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
office of
 
05:32:15.750 --> 05:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
licensed allied health professionals
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
by using the alternative title the
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
individuals holding that license would
 
05:32:24.070 --> 05:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
automatically be excluded for any from
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:31.510 --> 05:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
the underlying issue is
 
05:32:31.520 --> 05:32:32.548 align:start position:0%
the underlying issue is
having

05:32:32.548 --> 05:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
having
 
05:32:32.558 --> 05:32:33.350 align:start position:0%
having
two

05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
governmental bodies
 
05:32:37.350 --> 05:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
dealing with the same profession
 
05:32:40.070 --> 05:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
in i think it was 2017
 
05:32:40.080 --> 05:32:41.350 align:start position:0%
in i think it was 2017
the

05:32:41.350 --> 05:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:42.708 --> 05:32:42.718 align:start position:0%
department of education had a
 
05:32:42.718 --> 05:32:44.070 align:start position:0%
department of education had a
subcommittee

05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
05:32:44.080 --> 05:32:44.948 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
that

05:32:44.948 --> 05:32:44.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:47.750 --> 05:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
worked on updating the rules for speech
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
language specialists
 
05:32:49.440 --> 05:32:50.548 align:start position:0%
language specialists
and

05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:50.558 --> 05:32:51.510 align:start position:0%
and
the

05:32:51.510 --> 05:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:53.830 --> 05:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
goal of that committee was to make
 
05:32:53.840 --> 05:32:54.628 align:start position:0%
goal of that committee was to make
the

05:32:54.628 --> 05:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:32:56.948 --> 05:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
rules for the speech language specialist
 
05:32:58.310 --> 05:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
equal to
 
05:32:59.830 --> 05:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
the requirements for speech-language
 
05:32:59.840 --> 05:33:01.910 align:start position:0%
the requirements for speech-language
pathologist

05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
pathologist
 
05:33:04.628 --> 05:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
at that time the main difference is
 
05:33:06.708 --> 05:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
that the speech-language pathologist has
 
05:33:09.030 --> 05:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
to take a national exam and i don't
 
05:33:12.830 --> 05:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:15.990 --> 05:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
however the individuals that we are
 
05:33:18.948 --> 05:33:18.958 align:start position:0%
trying to move over to
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
allied health
 
05:33:22.628 --> 05:33:22.638 align:start position:0%
have been in the field for 20 30 40
 
05:33:22.638 --> 05:33:23.830 align:start position:0%
have been in the field for 20 30 40
years

05:33:23.830 --> 05:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:33:23.840 --> 05:33:24.868 align:start position:0%
years
and

05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
the new requirements didn't affect them
 
05:33:31.590 --> 05:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
anyone coming along now
 
05:33:31.600 --> 05:33:32.548 align:start position:0%
anyone coming along now
would

05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
have to meet the new requirements
 
05:33:34.718 --> 05:33:35.830 align:start position:0%
have to meet the new requirements
and

05:33:35.830 --> 05:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:37.670 --> 05:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that most people would go for
 
05:33:39.910 --> 05:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
the license
 
05:33:42.628 --> 05:33:42.638 align:start position:0%
especially if we eliminate the
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:57.590 --> 05:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
credential an issue that arose today was
 
05:34:00.390 --> 05:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
the medicaid to schools program
 
05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
and i believe that they have changed the
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
rule so that speech language
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
pathologists can sign off and order
 
05:34:14.470 --> 05:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:20.230 --> 05:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
but i think they fixed it
 
05:34:20.240 --> 05:34:26.628 align:start position:0%
but i think they fixed it
um

05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%

our k-12 system
 
05:36:36.230 --> 05:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
and to that end i'm here to address
 
05:36:38.470 --> 05:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
strictly department of education related
 
05:36:38.480 --> 05:36:39.670 align:start position:0%
strictly department of education related
questions

05:36:39.670 --> 05:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:36:39.680 --> 05:36:40.868 align:start position:0%
questions
um

05:36:40.868 --> 05:36:40.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:43.350 --> 05:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
just some quick facts and figures for
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:36:46.948 --> 05:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
we currently license over 28 000
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
educators statewide
 
05:36:51.270 --> 05:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
in positions ranging from para educators
 
05:36:52.868 --> 05:36:52.878 align:start position:0%
to superintendents
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have approximately 88 different
 
05:36:58.628 --> 05:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
endorsements that we license
 
05:37:01.910 --> 05:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
of that over 28 000 we currently license
 
05:37:06.868 --> 05:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
less than 60 speech language specialists
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
and when we looked at this issue and
 
05:37:11.910 --> 05:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
analyzed it about 18 months ago when the
 
05:37:14.868 --> 05:37:14.878 align:start position:0%
medicaid to schools issue was was a very
 
05:37:16.548 --> 05:37:16.558 align:start position:0%
big topic
 
05:37:18.310 --> 05:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
what we found was
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
our sls
 
05:37:24.070 --> 05:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
base of that less than 60 less than 20
 
05:37:27.830 --> 05:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
were not speech language pathologists
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that less than 20 number the average
 
05:37:36.150 --> 05:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
one other piece of information
 
05:37:41.510 --> 05:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
every year i receive numerous phone
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:47.350 --> 05:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
asking why
 
05:37:49.510 --> 05:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
this speech language pathologist calling
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
us asking why they have to pay the
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
department of education for a license
 
05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
as well as oplc for a license
 
05:37:59.750 --> 05:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we support
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
moving this entirely to oplc in whatever
 
05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
form that takes we're not medical
 
05:38:06.150 --> 05:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
professionals we're educators
 
05:38:06.160 --> 05:38:07.510 align:start position:0%
professionals we're educators
but

05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:38:09.190 --> 05:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
the follow-up question to the dual
 
05:38:11.830 --> 05:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
licensure is always well physical
 
05:38:14.230 --> 05:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
therapists and occupational therapists
 
05:38:17.910 --> 05:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't need an education license why do i
 
05:38:20.470 --> 05:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
so hence hence the support for moving
 
05:38:20.480 --> 05:38:21.350 align:start position:0%
so hence hence the support for moving
this

05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:38:24.628 --> 05:38:24.638 align:start position:0%
to oplc
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:39.430 --> 05:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:42.390 --> 05:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
i have concerns about
 
05:38:42.400 --> 05:38:45.510 align:start position:0%
i have concerns about
us

05:38:45.510 --> 05:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:47.590 --> 05:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
operating in the state with speech
 
05:38:50.310 --> 05:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
language pathologists and speech
 
05:38:52.470 --> 05:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
language specialists
 
05:38:52.480 --> 05:38:53.270 align:start position:0%
language specialists
i

05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
i'm confused as hell by it i can't
 
05:38:56.470 --> 05:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
imagine how someone from the general
 
05:38:58.070 --> 05:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
public is going to be how does the
 
05:39:00.230 --> 05:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
05:39:01.750 --> 05:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
what would the department of education
 
05:39:03.430 --> 05:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
look for what would you guys be using
 
05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
would you be looking for pathologists or
 
05:39:05.360 --> 05:39:06.948 align:start position:0%
would you be looking for pathologists or
specialists

05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
specialists
 
05:39:06.958 --> 05:39:07.990 align:start position:0%
specialists
so

05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:39:09.590 --> 05:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
we have not licensed a new
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
speech-language specialist
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
that was not also a speech-language
 
05:39:16.150 --> 05:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
pathologist in many years predates my
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
time coming to the department
 
05:39:20.708 --> 05:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
so the only folks today getting licenses
 
05:39:22.628 --> 05:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
from the department of education are
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
already slps
 
05:39:27.030 --> 05:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
and as evidenced by our administrative
 
05:39:29.430 --> 05:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
rule which states that you know here's a
 
05:39:32.548 --> 05:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
list of competencies to be an sls
 
05:39:32.558 --> 05:39:33.670 align:start position:0%
list of competencies to be an sls
or

05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:39:35.430 --> 05:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
if you have a valid speech language
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
pathologist license we will take that in
 
05:39:39.510 --> 05:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
your fee and we will issue you a license
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
as an sls
 
05:39:40.798 --> 05:39:43.270 align:start position:0%
as an sls
so

05:39:43.270 --> 05:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:46.070 --> 05:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
we don't see an influx of folks coming
 
05:39:48.390 --> 05:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
in to get an sls license who aren't
 
05:39:51.110 --> 05:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
already an slp
 
05:39:52.628 --> 05:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
so i guess what i'm saying here is it's
 
05:39:56.548 --> 05:39:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:59.110 --> 05:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative fellows
 
05:40:01.190 --> 05:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
so since
 
05:40:05.350 --> 05:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
so you so the schools want to employ
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
speech language pathologists
 
05:40:08.638 --> 05:40:09.830 align:start position:0%
speech language pathologists
and

05:40:09.830 --> 05:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:12.230 --> 05:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
you would like to see them be licensed
 
05:40:15.350 --> 05:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
by oplc
 
05:40:19.190 --> 05:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
don't you also need to certify them
 
05:40:21.910 --> 05:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
because one of the things we heard in a
 
05:40:24.470 --> 05:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
in an earlier bill is that
 
05:40:24.480 --> 05:40:26.830 align:start position:0%
in an earlier bill is that
oplc

05:40:26.830 --> 05:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
05:40:26.840 --> 05:40:28.708 align:start position:0%
oplc
um

05:40:28.708 --> 05:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:28.718 --> 05:40:29.910 align:start position:0%
um

05:40:31.590 --> 05:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
do or has
 
05:40:33.750 --> 05:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
difficulty with doesn't know how to
 
05:40:35.830 --> 05:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
really you know have good ideas for
 
05:40:39.430 --> 05:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
handling backgrounds criminal background
 
05:40:41.670 --> 05:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
checks which is very important in
 
05:40:41.680 --> 05:40:43.590 align:start position:0%
checks which is very important in
schools

05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:40:45.990 --> 05:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
so how how would you make sure that they
 
05:40:47.830 --> 05:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
05:40:49.350 --> 05:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
that criminal record so you don't want
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
them in schools thank you
 
05:40:54.150 --> 05:40:54.160 align:start position:0%

05:40:58.310 --> 05:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
until this past legislative session we
 
05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
did not criminal record check
 
05:41:02.788 --> 05:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
license holders
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%

05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
application or renewal the department of
 
05:41:06.798 --> 05:41:08.230 align:start position:0%
application or renewal the department of
education

05:41:08.230 --> 05:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:41:10.070 --> 05:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
did not criminal background check
 
05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
criminal history checked those
 
05:41:11.520 --> 05:41:12.708 align:start position:0%
criminal history checked those
individuals

05:41:12.708 --> 05:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
05:41:15.110 --> 05:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
we used to and then in the 1990s for
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
some reason that was dropped and pushed
 
05:41:19.270 --> 05:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
off on the districts so the statute that
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
has existed now for many years is that
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
the district is responsible for the
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
criminal history records check there was
 
05:41:27.990 --> 05:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that passed in the last
 
05:41:30.628 --> 05:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
session that tasked the department of ed
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
with also performing a criminal record
 
05:41:35.670 --> 05:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
check for all new applicants
 
05:41:37.110 --> 05:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
and that will go into effect once the
 
05:41:39.830 --> 05:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
fbi authorizes us to receive the record
 
05:41:41.990 --> 05:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
but that has not happened at our level
 
05:41:45.030 --> 05:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:45.040 --> 05:41:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:41:46.390 --> 05:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:48.230 --> 05:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
so your question was
 
05:41:49.590 --> 05:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
what about criminal
 
05:41:51.750 --> 05:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
history record checks that is performed
 
05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
at the employment level by all districts
 
05:41:55.830 --> 05:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
it is the law
 
05:41:57.430 --> 05:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
and the department of education is
 
05:41:59.190 --> 05:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
phasing back in performing it on
 
05:41:59.200 --> 05:42:00.948 align:start position:0%
phasing back in performing it on
licensees

05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh so the law went into effect january
 
05:42:09.830 --> 05:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
1st however the fbi has not given
 
05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
department of safety permission to
 
05:42:14.470 --> 05:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
release the record to us it's imminent
 
05:42:15.750 --> 05:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
we're hoping
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the next few weeks we get that record
 
05:42:19.750 --> 05:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
that that approval because it's the fbi
 
05:42:19.760 --> 05:42:20.948 align:start position:0%
that that approval because it's the fbi
record

05:42:20.948 --> 05:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
record
 
05:42:20.958 --> 05:42:22.390 align:start position:0%
record
right

05:42:22.390 --> 05:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
yep follow-up
 
05:42:24.958 --> 05:42:26.070 align:start position:0%
yep follow-up
so

05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
when that so let's pretend everything
 
05:42:29.590 --> 05:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
goes as planned in
 
05:42:32.310 --> 05:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
two years from now
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
you do you don't do you want us to
 
05:42:35.200 --> 05:42:36.470 align:start position:0%
you do you don't do you want us to
delete

05:42:36.470 --> 05:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
delete
 
05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
well it says speech language
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
specialist do you should you have speech
 
05:42:44.470 --> 05:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
language pathologists
 
05:42:49.030 --> 05:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
in this section about licensing
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
no we don't believe so because again we
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
would be dual licensing one individual
 
05:42:55.350 --> 05:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
and the feedback we have received from
 
05:42:58.150 --> 05:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
the field is
 
05:43:01.670 --> 05:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners do not see the need to pay
 
05:43:03.670 --> 05:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
two different state agencies
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
for two different licenses to do the
 
05:43:06.390 --> 05:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
05:43:08.470 --> 05:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
additionally the criminal history record
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
check which i understand the concern
 
05:43:12.788 --> 05:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
about oplc but i can assure you that the
 
05:43:15.110 --> 05:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
district's by state statute also must
 
05:43:17.910 --> 05:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
perform a check before that person
 
05:43:19.990 --> 05:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
can be alone with a child
 
05:43:20.000 --> 05:43:20.788 align:start position:0%
can be alone with a child
are

05:43:20.788 --> 05:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:43:23.350 --> 05:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
is is d.o.e going to start doing
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
criminal record checks on new
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes including speech with
 
05:43:29.910 --> 05:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
any new any new applicant for any
 
05:43:32.310 --> 05:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
endorsement that we offer
 
05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
but that is strictly related to the
 
05:43:35.910 --> 05:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
license not the employment
 
05:43:37.910 --> 05:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
yeah one more representative
 
05:43:40.788 --> 05:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
so does that mean schools will employ
 
05:43:40.798 --> 05:43:41.830 align:start position:0%
so does that mean schools will employ
speech

05:43:41.830 --> 05:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
speech
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
speech language pathologists but there
 
05:43:46.390 --> 05:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
will be no
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
certification of those positions by the
 
05:43:51.430 --> 05:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
department of ed
 
05:43:52.628 --> 05:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
that would be the effect of this
 
05:43:54.868 --> 05:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
legislation we would no longer certify
 
05:43:57.590 --> 05:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
speech language specialists who may or
 
05:43:59.830 --> 05:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
may not be a pathologist
 
05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
speech language
 
05:44:04.390 --> 05:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay we don't license speech language
 
05:44:06.628 --> 05:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
pathologist today the license that
 
05:44:07.990 --> 05:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
department of ed gives out is a
 
05:44:09.670 --> 05:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
specialist license
 
05:44:11.430 --> 05:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
which if you are a speech language
 
05:44:13.670 --> 05:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
pathologist you are automatically
 
05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
granted the license because you meet the
 
05:44:15.920 --> 05:44:17.110 align:start position:0%
granted the license because you meet the
requirements

05:44:17.110 --> 05:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:44:17.120 --> 05:44:19.030 align:start position:0%
requirements
so

05:44:19.030 --> 05:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:44:22.390 --> 05:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay so that sounds to me like a unique
 
05:44:25.190 --> 05:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
situation for people who are employed by
 
05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:31.350 --> 05:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't know that you could
 
05:44:32.868 --> 05:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
speak to that but i'm not sure i
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
because it's beyond it's beyond your
 
05:44:35.520 --> 05:44:36.628 align:start position:0%
because it's beyond it's beyond your
scope

05:44:36.628 --> 05:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
scope
 
05:44:38.230 --> 05:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis
 
05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um just to make sure i
 
05:44:43.270 --> 05:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
understand correctly the
 
05:44:44.948 --> 05:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
background checks criminal background
 
05:44:46.548 --> 05:44:46.558 align:start position:0%
checks are done by the districts and are
 
05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
going to be done by the doe
 
05:44:50.150 --> 05:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
are going to be done for
 
05:44:50.160 --> 05:44:51.190 align:start position:0%
are going to be done for
anybody

05:44:51.190 --> 05:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
working in the schools
 
05:44:55.670 --> 05:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
and it's not tied to particular
 
05:44:58.708 --> 05:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
licensing is that correct
 
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
i mean so what i'm getting at is
 
05:45:03.910 --> 05:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
let's say oplc may or may not do any
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
kind of criminal background check for
 
05:45:07.830 --> 05:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
the speech language pathologist but and
 
05:45:09.670 --> 05:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be
 
05:45:11.350 --> 05:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
licensing them
 
05:45:13.830 --> 05:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
but regardless is it true that for them
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
to work in the school there's going to
 
05:45:17.430 --> 05:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
be a background check done
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative yes that is
 
05:45:19.680 --> 05:45:20.548 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative yes that is
correct

05:45:20.548 --> 05:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:28.230 --> 05:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
does any other member of the committee
 
05:45:30.310 --> 05:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
05:45:42.150 --> 05:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
is there any other member of the public
 
05:45:45.430 --> 05:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify if you could come
 
05:45:54.070 --> 05:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:55.190 --> 05:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
two things
 
05:45:56.788 --> 05:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
one it would i would prefer you bring it
 
05:45:59.990 --> 05:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
up now if you could for the clerk and
 
05:46:01.510 --> 05:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
the other one was the microphone but you
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
seem to have found that yes thank you uh
 
05:46:05.350 --> 05:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i'll be very
 
05:46:06.868 --> 05:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
brief for the record my name is tom
 
05:46:08.708 --> 05:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
prasal from demers and praise all here
 
05:46:10.548 --> 05:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
today representing the new hampshire
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
speech language hearing association
 
05:46:14.788 --> 05:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to address a couple
 
05:46:16.788 --> 05:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
points um when this bill was initially
 
05:46:19.750 --> 05:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
drafted it came from language that nisha
 
05:46:23.430 --> 05:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
had provided to representative mcguire
 
05:46:25.270 --> 05:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
after that was submitted to the office
 
05:46:27.270 --> 05:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
of legislative services nishala has
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
worked with asha the american speech and
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
hearing association
 
05:46:33.190 --> 05:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
to draft uh
 
05:46:35.590 --> 05:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
language and that is the amendment that
 
05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative marsh so kindly drafted
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
from ols so i think you know
 
05:46:42.708 --> 05:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
everybody here would agree that we
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
should focus on the amendment and not
 
05:46:46.628 --> 05:46:46.638 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill so i want to start
 
05:46:48.788 --> 05:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
off with that and second i just wanted
 
05:46:50.868 --> 05:46:50.878 align:start position:0%
to you know i think the point was raised
 
05:46:51.990 --> 05:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:46:54.390 --> 05:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
that um there's a currently two licenses
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
right you know and they if you're a
 
05:46:58.150 --> 05:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
speech language pathologist you're
 
05:46:59.510 --> 05:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
automatically a speech language
 
05:47:01.510 --> 05:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
specialist so there's no need to move
 
05:47:02.788 --> 05:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
forward with the speech language
 
05:47:05.110 --> 05:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
specialist license which is what what
 
05:47:07.030 --> 05:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment does if you see
 
05:47:08.548 --> 05:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
when you read through which i understand
 
05:47:10.708 --> 05:47:10.718 align:start position:0%
most of you just got it today you'll see
 
05:47:12.708 --> 05:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
it essentially phases out the speech
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
language specialist license
 
05:47:16.070 --> 05:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i understand the spill is going to
 
05:47:17.670 --> 05:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
sub-committee and i'm happy to work with
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
the committee through that process but i
 
05:47:21.830 --> 05:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
was just trying to hopefully simplify i
 
05:47:23.830 --> 05:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of confusion between
 
05:47:27.910 --> 05:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
sls slp sla a lot of that so just trying
 
05:47:27.920 --> 05:47:28.628 align:start position:0%
sls slp sla a lot of that so just trying
to

05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
simplify things a bit and with that
 
05:47:34.868 --> 05:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say but i'm happy
 
05:47:35.910 --> 05:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee during a
 
05:47:35.920 --> 05:47:37.270 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee during a
subcommittee

05:47:37.270 --> 05:47:37.280 align:start position:0%

05:48:06.230 --> 05:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:07.910 --> 05:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
i know i think i've spent the whole day
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:13.510 --> 05:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
lindsay courtney executive director oplc
 
05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
oplc would support any legislation that
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
would eliminate unnecessary duplicate
 
05:48:17.840 --> 05:48:20.150 align:start position:0%
would eliminate unnecessary duplicate
licenses

05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
i i can't testify to the board's
 
05:48:25.190 --> 05:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
position on this particular legislation
 
05:48:27.430 --> 05:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
but we certainly shared the initial
 
05:48:30.548 --> 05:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
concerns of the bill as proposed but we
 
05:48:31.990 --> 05:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
support the amendment i'd be happy to
 
05:48:34.070 --> 05:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
answer any questions i know that a
 
05:48:36.390 --> 05:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
question came up regarding criminal his
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
records history checks history records
 
05:48:38.558 --> 05:48:39.830 align:start position:0%
records history checks history records
checked

05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
checked
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
the speech language pathology board does
 
05:48:43.990 --> 05:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
currently require initial applicants to
 
05:48:46.230 --> 05:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
undergo criminal history records checks
 
05:48:47.670 --> 05:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
so that's currently being done happy to
 
05:48:54.310 --> 05:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
represent scitec
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i might as well go for it um
 
05:49:01.830 --> 05:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is actually a uh
 
05:49:03.670 --> 05:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
a question for
 
05:49:06.390 --> 05:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
is mr applebee's still here oh there he
 
05:49:07.830 --> 05:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
05:49:10.310 --> 05:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
you said you're waiting for the fbi to
 
05:49:10.320 --> 05:49:11.510 align:start position:0%
you said you're waiting for the fbi to
check

05:49:11.510 --> 05:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
check
 
05:49:14.070 --> 05:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh to to release how come the local
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
school district could do a background
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
check but the department of education
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
has to wait for the fbi to do something
 
05:49:26.230 --> 05:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:49:27.680 --> 05:49:30.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

05:49:30.310 --> 05:49:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:49:33.030 --> 05:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
the fbi is very particular about their
 
05:49:34.868 --> 05:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
approvals for release of their records
 
05:49:37.110 --> 05:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
around criminal history checks so they
 
05:49:40.470 --> 05:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
must approve all legislative changes
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
so there is already in our statutes
 
05:49:44.470 --> 05:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that the fbi is
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
approved for school districts
 
05:49:48.628 --> 05:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
but that language did not exist for the
 
05:49:50.948 --> 05:49:50.958 align:start position:0%
doe to receive the record
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're waiting on
 
05:49:58.708 --> 05:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:01.510 --> 05:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
well with that if uh if anybody else
 
05:50:04.868 --> 05:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
from the committee has any questions
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will close the public
 
05:59:35.830 --> 05:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:35.840 --> 06:14:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:14:49.750 --> 06:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:49.760 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
you
