era the past 40 years have 140 years
 
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
rather have led to
 
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
essentially some of the most significant
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
achievements in the history of
 
00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 align:start position:0%
civilization and
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
electricity has been largely responsible
 
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
for that electricity today is the
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
civilization some people have just
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
described the electricity grid as the
 
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
greatest machine that's ever been
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
built it's complex it's huge has many
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
many moving
 
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
parts and keeping it
 
00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
running reliably and
 
00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
stably with stability is an incredible
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
task but to protect our way of life we
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
grid the reliability of our grid relies
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
on is comprised of two components one is
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
capacity meeting demand generating
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
enough electricity to meet the
 
00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:27.639 align:start position:0%
demand but the other is stability and
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
stability has some tech technical ter
 
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
some technical components and some
 
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
some technical components and some
non-technical

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
non-technical
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
components one of the technical
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
components is frequency maintaining
 
00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
frequency of the power
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
system grid frequency refers to the rate
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
at which alternating current oscillates
 
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
hertz and deviation from the standard
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
frequency can have significant
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
consequences including potential damage
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
to equipment and disruptions in the
 
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
operation of electrical devices that
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
damage can be
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
significant if the grid were to go
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
down in such a way that major components
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
of grid infrastructure were damaged it
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
could take months some even say years to
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
restore that
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and in the
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
so the reliability and the stability of
 
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.509 align:start position:0%
so the reliability and the stability of
our

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
grid is a key to our
 
00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
continued life enjoyment of
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
think that's a kind of a preamble to
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
explain why I've introduced or why I am
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
1623 I call
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
this colloquially the New Hampshire

electrical
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
power we can't live without it simple as
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
that and because we live in a regional
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
grid there's not a lot we can do at the
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
state level to protect our electricity
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
Supply but we can do some
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
things this bill asserts the
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%

00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
happen this gives the state some

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
overreach this bill also establishes
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
that market forces should drive the

Preamble electricity is the lifeblood of
this

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
civilization and if we're not doing
 
00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519 align:start position:0%
everything we can to protect
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
it we're
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
not delivering on the Mandate of our
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
elected office to protect the health
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
citizens so I believe that as line 13 of
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
the states that the state has a duty to
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
defend the production and supply of
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
affordable reliable dispatchable and
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
interference and that's one of the
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
reasons that I submitted this
 
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
bill but in addition to the protections
 
00:12:54.189 --> 00:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
that it offers to the possibility that a
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
significant power generation Source
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
could be prematurely shut down the bill
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
also puts into
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
Concepts Concepts such as allowing

energy
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
resources to prescribe that government
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
intervention should be limited narrow
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
and necessary for a specific policy

and necessary for a specific policy
goal

00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
goal
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
to state emphatically
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire should
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
pursue goals like energy conservation
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
and efficiency according to Market
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
principles and without New Hampshire
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
shall maintain an environment that
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
allows for accurate Market signals while
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
balancing low consumer prices price
 
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
reliability and the bill goes on to say
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire shall promote the use
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
sources but that it should
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
consider the entire life cycle of that
 
00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:14.189 align:start position:0%
consider the entire life cycle of that
energy

00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
resource now there is a f fiscal note
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
attached to the uh bill which indicates
 
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:21.790 align:start position:0%
attached to the uh bill which indicates
that

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the Public
 
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.389 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the Public
Utilities

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
Utilities
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
Commission might be incurring some costs
 
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.629 align:start position:0%
Commission might be incurring some costs
if

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:14:31.749 --> 00:14:31.759 align:start position:0%
the section three of the bill was
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
ever uh required to be used to a section
 
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:37.880 align:start position:0%
two of the bill rather required to be
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
used to
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
um deal with an electricity generator
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's being prematurely forced to
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
retire that uh is a concern worth
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
discussing and I will probably discuss
 
00:14:59.430 --> 00:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
that with the department at a
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
before sometime before exec session to
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
see if there's a way we can address that
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
issue before we go to exec session so I
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
think I've lined laid out the uh the
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill as I intended it what I intended it
 
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.550 align:start position:0%
bill as I intended it what I intended it
for

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
it may not may not be the most elegant
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
template for a bill to do something to
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
help us protect our energy
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
resources but as the govern pointed out
 
00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
just yesterday or the day before the
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
States created the Federal Government
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
the federal government didn't create the
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
states so the most important part of
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
this legislation is to assert our state
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
sovereignty to do whatever we can to
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
protect the citizens who live here the
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
citizens who elected us to this
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
office this may not not be the most
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
elegant template as my good friend uh
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
from Lebanon will recall computer
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
programmers when they create or design
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
an algorithm they strive for
 
00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.710 align:start position:0%
an algorithm they strive for
Elegance

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
Elegance
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
efficiency uh speed Etc this may not be
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
the most elegant template for doing
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
something about protecting our health
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
and the safety of our citizens but I
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
like its simplicity and I like its
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
assertion of our state
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
sovereignty so with that I'll be happy
 
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
to answer questions if I can and then
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
listen to what I'm sure will be a
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
spirited uh
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
response uh thank you representative
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'll take the first question just for
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
administrative reasons on page two line
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
16 and in difference to what you said
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh when you talk about clean
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
energy would you all also say that that
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
should be read as non-carbon generating
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
energy or something to the effect that
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
yesterday you mean non-carbon dioxide
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
emitting right generation yeah yes
 
00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:17.590 align:start position:0%
emitting right generation yeah yes
absolutely

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
okay as uh I discussed yesterday there
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
is no definition and statute anywhere of
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
what clean clean energy is and in fact
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
it's a term that's been used used so
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
frequently that it probably has as many
 
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
meanings today as people want to ascribe
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
to it it it's come become kind of an
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
imprecise term so we probably should use
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
terms like non CO2 emitting sources
 
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.630 align:start position:0%
terms like non CO2 emitting sources
you're

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
paral thank you chair Thomas and thank
 
00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
you uh representative o for your test
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
Tony today I appreciate it hope I got
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
that right um go picking up on uh
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
um the last
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
question I am seeing that use of clean
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
energy sources by considering the
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
emissions throughout the entire life
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
cycle clean energy carbon free energy
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it does this
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
put an extra burden upon those what are
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
typically called renewable sources while
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
letting uh fossil fuel
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
account I wouldn't think so I think we
 
00:18:41.549 --> 00:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
should be taking into account for
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
build all the expenses that we're going
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
to recur to build
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
if emissions of carbon dioxide are
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
considered an
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
expense then we would have to take that
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
rals thank you Mr Vice chairman um and
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for taking my
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
question um as you noted in your opening
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
remarks um the state of New
 
00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gets its energy its
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
electricity as part of a
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
regional power
 
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
grid governed
 
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.630 align:start position:0%
grid governed
by

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
Regional um Regional
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
bodies um and I would note that these
 
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
Regional bodies and
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
the power generation facilities
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
that are governed
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
by uh the bodies the regional grid are
 
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
all privately owned
 
00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
um did you have in mind when you're
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
writing this bill did you have in mind
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
the situation uh that we've referenced a
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
couple times in the committee here uh
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
about the retirement of the Mystic River
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
Power Station uh in Boston is that what
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
is sort of
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
motivating this piece of
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
legislation no this uh piece of
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
legislation is focused on what few
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
generation sources are right here in New
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire such as cabber nuclear power
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
station the um gas fired power plant in
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
London der the Burgess biopower plant up
 
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.590 align:start position:0%
London der the Burgess biopower plant up
in

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
Berlin uh those kinds of resources that
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
are located in the state right follow up
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
follow up but um again noting that all
 
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.350 align:start position:0%
follow up but um again noting that all
of

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
those generating assets
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
are privately owned
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
facilities and and you make reference in
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
the legislation to you know Market
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
forces I guess I'm curious as to what is
 
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.830 align:start position:0%
forces I guess I'm curious as to what is
contemplated

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
contemplated
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
um what you're contemplating this giving
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
the State the power to sort of take
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
control or override um a a private
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
entity a business's decision
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
to you know potentially close a a power
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
plant are you contemplating that the
 
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire would step in
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't know take ownership or or
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
prevent uh something from happening with
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
one of these assets I guess I'm no
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
puzzle if you look at page two of the
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill line 18 it says an electricity
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
generator that receiv receives notice of
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
any Federal Regulation that may result
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
in the forced retirement of the
 
00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:12.430 align:start position:0%
in the forced retirement of the
generator's

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
generator's
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
facility shall and then at that point uh
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
it goes on to explain what a generator
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
can do to seek
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
relief so no I'm not saying that if a
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
private company that that owns a
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
generation plant for business reasons
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
decides it has to shut that plant down
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly within its rights to do
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
that that's apparently what's going to
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
be happening with Mystic station that
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned earlier what I'm
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
specifically concerned about here is
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
that uh regulation that is not
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
authorized by
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
specific congressionally passed law
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
could force a premature primate
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
premature retirement of
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
a power generation facility
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
and this gives the state an Avenue to
 
00:23:12.909 --> 00:23:12.919 align:start position:0%
deal with that if it should
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
happen Okay thank you representative
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
um understanding what you just said uh
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
are the plants in Bow as well as
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth the sheller
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
facility uh potential
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh entities that are under some kind of
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
non- congressional uh
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
oversight forcing potential shutdown or
 
00:23:51.149 --> 00:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
activities I'm not aware of any that are
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
currently happening but they would be
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
potential targets as would any other n
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr Vice chair and thank you
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
I I I I just want to follow up on a on a
 
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
on a comment you made um previously in
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
response to representative reels about
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
external regulatory authorities just I'm
 
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand a little bit better
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
what that is I what I heard you say was
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
that it was it would be a body that was
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
not specifically authorized by by by
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
Congress can you give me some examples
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
of that because you I'm thinking for
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
example of you know like isoo England I
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm guessing I I'm I'm not sure
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
but I assume that that somehow comes
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
under you know Authority granted by
 
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
Congress to FK and and other entities so
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
what what spec what spefic specific
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
external regulatory authorities do you
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
have in
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
mind so you're right ISO New England
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
falls under the federal power act which
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
is implemented by
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
furk however sometimes regulatory
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
agencies for example the
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
EPA promulgate regulations that are not
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by an act of
 
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.430 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by an act of
Congress

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
and frequently the EPA gets taken to
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
court over regulations that it
 
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.029 align:start position:0%
court over regulations that it
has

00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
established that are not directly
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
authorized by an act of Congress and the
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
courts then decide is that
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
constitutional or is that a violation of
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
the Constitution there is one pending
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
before The Supreme Court right now uh
 
00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.950 align:start position:0%
before The Supreme Court right now uh
concerning

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
a doctrine that goes back to 19 1984
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
called the
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
Chevron uh difference Doctrine and to me
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
that's a classic example
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
of federal regulatory overreach that a
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
state like New Hampshire exercising its
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
Sovereign rights ought to be able to
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
challenge if that if those regulations
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
are going to negatively impinge on the
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
health safety and Welfare of New
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
followup yes quickly so so on the you
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
know I'm glad you brought up the chevron
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
case um so in that instance um um you
 
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.190 align:start position:0%
case um so in that instance um um you
know

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:26:44.909 --> 00:26:44.919 align:start position:0%
somebody I can't remember who the
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs were but they took they went
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
to court Supreme Court made a ruling
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
that um the agencies did have the
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
authority under the Constitution so um
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't New Hampshire then follow that
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
Court ruling because it's it was
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
determined to be
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional or I I guess I wanted to
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
make sure you weren't suggesting that
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
even if the Supreme Court made a ruling
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
that something was constitutional New
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should still pursue a Avenue
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
that goes counter to that
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
ruling no you are correct I wouldn't uh
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
assert that but in the case of the
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
Chevron Doctrine case that's pending
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
before The Supreme Court it has not been
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
decided yet
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
and if the Supreme Court does
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
decide as some observers are suspecting
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
that it will set
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
aside the precedent of the Chevron
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
difference Doctrine then it will be more
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
it will be easier for individuals who
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
are who are harmed by regulatory
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
overreach to
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
find uh redress in in the courts for
 
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
behavior uh I'd like to remind before we
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
move on here we have five other speakers
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
on this topic uh time being what it is
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
and among those speakers are clean
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
energy new hampt Department of energy
 
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
New England power generator uh
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
conservation law so if you have any
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
questions that would be better presented
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
to those speakers I would suggest that
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
we hold them for that with that said uh
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
I'll call on representative Bernardi for
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
his question thank you Mr Vice chair so
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh non- Congressional uh uh
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
authorized action could also include uh
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
executive uh Decisions by the the
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
president that are not uh based in any
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh particular statutory uh uh approvals
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
most definitely those are some of the
 
00:28:58.029 --> 00:28:58.039 align:start position:0%
more dangerous um acttiv activities that
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:02.679 align:start position:0%
challenged representative
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um so to get back to the
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
bill one of the things that concerned me
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
when I saw this bill is that it seeks to
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
repeal uh the the statutory definition
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire energy policy under 378
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
37 colon 37 and that was a um an aspect
 
00:29:30.669 --> 00:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
of the leas cost integrated resource
 
00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:36.039 align:start position:0%
planning um RSA that was saved last year
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
during the Senate hearings on House Bill
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
281 folks realized that that was on the
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
chopping block and said we need to save
 
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
that definition and that definition
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
which is quite brief says the general
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
court declares that it shall be the
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
energy policy of this state to meet the
 
00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:55.240 align:start position:0%
energy needs of its citizens and
 
00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559 align:start position:0%
businesses of the state at thecal lest
 
00:29:59.549 --> 00:29:59.559 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost while providing for the
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
reliability and diversity of energy
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
sources to maximize the use of
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
costeffective Energy Efficiency and
 
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:08.039 align:start position:0%
other demand side resources and to
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
protect the safety and health of the
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
citizens the physical environment of the
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
state and the future supplies of
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
resources with consideration to the
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
financial stability of the state's
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
utilities it was discussed in that
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing that this was a um a a
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
well-defined and
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
suitable uh level of New Hampshire
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
energy policy in terms of a definitional
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
framework the issue that I have with the
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
bill is that when it redefines that
 
00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
framework it is it is taking the protect
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
the safety and health of the citizens
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
and sort of redefining the way we
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
approach that and um it's it the way to
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
my reading it looks like what it's
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
saying is we need to um be able to
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
provide fossil
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
fuel electric generation in order to
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
protect the safety of the citizens of
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
the state um which I think is is at odds
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the other um policy
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
decisions that have been made over the
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
past 20 years so I'm just trying to
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
figure out whether we're moving
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
backwards in putting that in removing
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
language that is more um inclusive of
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
the types of policies that we've been
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
moving towards to sort of put the thumb
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
on the scale of
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
um of energy sources that we have been
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
moving away
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
from well I didn't hear a question there
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
but I'll react to your statement by
 
00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.190 align:start position:0%
but I'll react to your statement by
saying

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
that this legislation attempts to deal
 
00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:52.870 align:start position:0%
that this legislation attempts to deal
with

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
reality the reality is that 80% of the
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
world's energy comes from fossil
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
fuels today and it has been this way for
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
the last 20 25
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
years in spite of the fact that we spent
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
7 trillion dollar to try to replace
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels with something
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
else and we haven't
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
succeeded because the replacement
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
technology just isn't up to the
 
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
task so I think it's time that we start
 
00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.549 align:start position:0%
task so I think it's time that we start
recognizing

00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:31.559 align:start position:0%
that this is our
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
future we might not love it we might not
 
00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
think it's perfect but this is our
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
future until something better comes
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
along now we don't want to erect
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
barriers to the possibility that
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
something better will come
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
along but at the same time we have to
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that we're not there yet it
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's maybe an unpleasant isn't
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
thing to have to acknowledge but it is
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
reality um May I follow up one follow up
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think uh I understand what
 
00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying and I understand where
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
you're coming from
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
I I would beg to differ on the
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
definition of of the safety uh of the
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
citizens I think that's where we have
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
the difference of opinion is that the
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
safety of the citizens representative
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
excuse me there's not a debate is is
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
your a question there
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah um the safety of the
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
citizens in terms of our energy policy
 
00:33:36.269 --> 00:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that's been in
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
statute is regards to lowering emissions
 
00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's in regards to the threat that
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
is posed from a warming
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
atmosphere so that's we're we're
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
changing that definition to mean
 
00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.789 align:start position:0%
changing that definition to mean
something

00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
else and that's that's what I'm asking
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
you about I'm saying is that is that the
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
since you just asked the same question
 
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
or made the same statement twice I'll
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
just repeat my response which is this
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
reality okay I think we've answered
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
asked enough questions uh from Mr
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
representative I would like to move on
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
we have five other speakers here and if
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
you have questions you can ask them as
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
well we're starting to go circular
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
around the same the same information so
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative o and I'm going
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
to call on Mr Sam Evans Brown from clean
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
energy New
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to give us your impression
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.200 align:start position:0%
uh I can I can wait okay uh for the
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
record uh Sam Evans Brown executive
 
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
director of clean energy New Hampshire I
 
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
will say Mr chair I always appreciate
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
how you call me Mr Sam Evans Brown makes
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
me feel very respected so always
 
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
something I appreciate when I get called
 
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
up to the Lector in
 
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
here um so I thought I'd just start by
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
reading into the into the uh uh the
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
record what the state current energy
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
policy declaration is it says the
 
00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
general court declares that it shall be
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
the energy policy of the state to meet
 
00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
the energy needs of the citizens and
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
businesses of the state at the lowest
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost which this statute will
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
repeal that phrase um while providing
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
for the reliability and diversity of
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
energy sources to maximize the use of
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
cost-effective Energy Efficiency and
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
other demands side resources and to
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
protect the health and safety of the
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
citizens the physical environment of the
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
state and the future supplies of
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
Resources with consideration of the
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
financial stability of the state's
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
utilities I see that as a very simple
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
declarative and adequate statement that
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
is going to be repealed if this bill
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
were to be uh adopted um in particular
 
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
there are a number of areas in this
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
statute that I find concerning that I'd
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
love to raise with the committee um but
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
since the the we have been told that
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is about reality um I'd also
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
like to uh talk about another aspect of
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
the reality that is confronting Us in
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
the state which is that currently uh
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
north of
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
99% of the resources that are proposed
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
that are part of the iso New England
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue are either wind
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
solar or batteries
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
99% so there there are vanishingly few
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
projects that are actually being
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
proposed by people who have access to
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
Capital that uh that are fossil fueled
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
resources there's something on the
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 180 megaw of gas turbine
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
imp improvements that are part of that
 
00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
interconnection que and so my concern
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
with this language is that what it is is
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
a giant flashing warning sign to any
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
developer that they shouldn't try to
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
build things in New Hampshire and that
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
they should take the capital that they
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
have and bring it to other states that
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
are more friendly to the types of
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
resources that are that are being
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
deployed um the question of why are
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
these resources being deployed is a
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
really important one and I would argue
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's because the market has spoken when
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
you look at levelized cost of energy
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
wind and solar are the cheapest resource
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
that you can deploy and if we were to
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
put into statute language that makes uh
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
a a statement such as the one that
 
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.589 align:start position:0%
a a statement such as the one that
appears

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
appears
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
on um page one line 25 with an EMP
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
emphasis on dispatchable resources
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
without regard of whether
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
dispatchability actually uh creates rate
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
payer savings um I think that we're
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
leaving a lot of rate payer benefit on
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
the table um I'd like to talk about a
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
couple of programs that I think would uh
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
confront difficulty in uh achieving
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory approval if this was the
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
energy policy that is on the books um so
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
for instance the New Hampshire saves
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
three-year plan which uh currently
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
creates is forecast to create $675
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
Million worth of rate pay or benefit I
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
think would face struggle getting
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
through the regulatory process with a
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
statement like the one that appears
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
online on page two uh that New Hampshire
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
Shel pursue pursue energy conservation
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
and efficiency according to Market
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
principles and without government
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
subsidies let's take a step back and
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
remember why New Hampshire saves exists
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
which is that it's broadly recognized
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
that Energy Efficiency is an area that
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
is a market failure in which uh uh folks
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
who make the decisions about about their
 
00:38:58.589 --> 00:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
their energy their energy Investments
 
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
frequently lack the information required
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
struggle to understand the cost benefit
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
um struggle to have the capital required
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
to to uh to invest in these
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
cost-effective measures um and so for
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
decades despite the fact that these are
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
cost-effective as as evidenced by the
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
large rate payer benefit that that acrs
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire saves plan we
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
have struggled to get folks to to invest
 
00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
in these measures of their own accord
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
that is a market failure and what are we
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
saying when we say that we want to
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
pursue Energy Efficiency strictly by
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
market principles it's essentially
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
saying let's not pursue uh those those
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
cost-effective uh Investments um
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
similarly Unitil just had approved a 5
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar array it's a
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
utility-owned solar array in Kingston
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh forecast to to generate $2
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
million worth of rate paay benefits by
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
2035 once it's up and running um the
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
emphasis on dispatchability might say
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to invest in that
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
type of of infrastructure regardless of
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
the rate payer benefit that's accured by
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh this acing from it um New Hampshire
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
is not you to to address a question that
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
was asked earlier we are not the entity
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
that ensures the reliability of the
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
electric grid that is ISO New England
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
that is their federally uh that is their
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
federally federally delegated Duty
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
because of the complexity of the the New
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
England grid and the fact that it
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
crosses State boundaries so it is not up
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
to us to ensure frequency uh reliability
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's what the iso is for and I think
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
putting into in language into State
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
Statute that suggests that that we're
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
trying to Eclipse that Authority from
 
00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:35.079 align:start position:0%
ISO New England is is unnecessary and
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
and again going back to the the simple
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
and elegant definition that we already
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
have in statute I would argue the
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
language is already a little bit there
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
that says that we want to make sure that
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
health and safety are are uh are ured
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
for our
 
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
citizens um and and lastly I I I take I
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
take exception as well to uh line 16 on
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
page two that uh that when we are
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
promoting the use of clean energy
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
resources by ensuring the life cycle uh
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
of of that energy resource it is
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
entirely unclear to me why we are only
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
considering the life cycle of just clean
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
energy resources I actually do think
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
that life cycle accounting is a very
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
important tool that we should be taking
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh taking into account for whatever
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
energy choice we make but uh it it seems
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
like a double standard that that would
 
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
only be applied to a single type of
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
resource in particular the mining burden
 
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
associated with fossil fuel extraction
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
is is quite intense and if you'll have
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
ever talked to folks who live um outside
 
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
of the you know the Eagle Ford Shale in
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
Texas and talk about the Benzene
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
emissions that come from those
 
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
facilities they'll they'll tell you that
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
there's burdens there as well um and and
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
so uh I think generally speaking I
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate the attempt to uh to try to
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
flesh out what the state's energy policy
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
is um I would argue that if uh this is
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
something that the general court wants
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
to uh Embark upon it should be done so
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
in in you know a more uh bipartisan way
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
that that solicits feedback from lots of
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
individuals and puts into puts into
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
place something that provides regulatory
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
certainty for our utilities as opposed
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
to um as opposed to this language so
 
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
with that I'll
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
pause thank you questions representative
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you um I wasn't able to
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
asked the prime sponsor so I guess I'll
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
ask you on uh line three page two it
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
talks about removing regulatory barriers
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
to Innovation to ensure that the state
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
can procure affordable reliable and
 
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
secure energy resources it doesn't say
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
removing some it says removing
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory barriers so my question to
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
you is do you see this as an attempt to
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
decouple New Hampshire from the United
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
States energy program Andor um ISO New
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
England um H uh well I'm I'm uh I know
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
you were hoping to ask the prime sponsor
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
that question so I will not I will not
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
speculate what the intention was there I
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
I personally actually see that line as
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
as less problematic than other pieces of
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation I would agree that
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
there are regulatory barriers to
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
Innovation um that that we could address
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
here in the state in terms of how the
 
00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission approaches
 
00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh investments in the energy system and
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
and in particular um opening up uh
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
distribution system improvements uh to
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
to uh investments from third parties
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
which I think is an area that that's
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
quite Prime for Innovation um so uh
 
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
again I i' prefer not to speculate as to
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
what that is about followup
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
followup thank you um and just my second
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
question to the prime sponsor you've
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
sort of covered it but I just want
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
confirmation on on line nine that that
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
statement without state government
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
subsidies that would essentially kill NH
 
00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
saves correct uh again it to me it is
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
actually un it is it is a matter of
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
substantial debate as to whether the
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
system benefits charge is indeed a
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
subsidy I would argue that that is a a
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
approved investment in a demand side
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
Resource as opposed to a subsidy uh I
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
know that opponents to the New Hampshire
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
saves program have have attempted to
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
characterize it as a subsidy but I would
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
reject that character a um I would be
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that that uh some Regulators
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
might use that language in order to
 
00:44:35.549 --> 00:44:35.559 align:start position:0%
attempt to dismantle pieces of our of
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
our rate pair funded Energy Efficiency
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
program thank you very
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
much representative leki uh thank you Mr
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you Mr Brown um
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
would we seem to be wrestling with the
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
concept of um you know the reliability
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
of Renewables and dispatchability and
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
would you um be in favor of perhaps when
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
people are doing industrial scale U
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
Renewables window power solar um that
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
they be a mandate that they have some
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
amount of that capacity be 24 hours of
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
backup so that they really could be
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
dispatchable uh I would not uh be in
 
00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
favor of that specific mandate that you
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
just put in place I would argue that we
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
are actually going to be seeing much
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
more coupled storage uh with renewable
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
energy variable Renewables uh going
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
forward because of Market forces uh the
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
reason that I think we'll be seeing that
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
is that uh interconnection is
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
increasingly the largest impediment to
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
deploying of any of these resources they
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
are they are low cost they make sense on
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
their own um but but finding a place to
 
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
plug them into the grid is getting
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
harder and harder and so uh I've heard
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
interconnection referred to as the pixie
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
dust of of these types of renewable
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
energy projects and so how do you
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
maximize the value of that very
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
expensive investment into
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
interconnection to the grid you do it
 
00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
with storage by therefore maximizing how
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
much you know minimizing how much you
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
have to spend on the infrastructure
 
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
interconnect and maximizing how much
 
00:46:05.309 --> 00:46:05.319 align:start position:0%
you're using that infrastructure so I
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't think we need a mandate I think
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
it'll happen on its
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
own follow up followup please um and
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
where what is the state of the uh
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
storage um ability how much energy can
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
you store how much does that cost so uh
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
the the cost of lithium ion storage is
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
falling rapidly there was a Quick bump
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic because of supply
 
00:46:31.109 --> 00:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
chain issues um but you know the the uh
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
solution to high prices is high prices
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
and uh there have been massive
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
announcements of of uh lithium
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
processing capacity all around the world
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
and so the cost of lithium is fall or
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
lithium ion battery cells is is falling
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
again um it's it's around the
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of $150 per megawatt hour
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
presently um and and declining there are
 
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:53.559 align:start position:0%
also other sources of of storage that um
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
that have announced really impressive
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
figures in particular um there's a
 
00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
company called form energy that has an
 
00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:01.559 align:start position:0%
iron air battery that that claims to be
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
able to do $20 per megawatt hour um they
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
have just built a production facility in
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
West Virginia and are starting to deploy
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
their first projects um that are on a
 
00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
pilot scale um and I'm very bullish on
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
that technology that's you know lithium
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
ion is typically in the neighborhood of
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
a 4our sort of a peaking resource you
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know you charge it during the the um
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
times of very low uh prices and then you
 
00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
discharge typically in the evening and
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
on a daily cycle uh versus the iron air
 
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
battery is really it's almost a seasonal
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
storage uh uh technology where you can
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
charge it for you can discharge it for
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
weeks at a time can be a a you know
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the battery you
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
put in you know one week two week 3 week
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
um resource so uh there's there's a lot
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
of innovation happening in the space and
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
I um I fully believe that by the time we
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
get to 2030 the the variability
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
challenge will be something that um that
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
feels much more soluble um I would say
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
though that currently we have a solution
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
to variability which is that we keep
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
capacity resources online and we just
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
run them less we use we use uh these
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
variable Renewables as fuel Savers and
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what was uh pointed out
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
by ISO New England and their decision to
 
00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
close the Mystic station is that we are
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
saving enormous amounts of fuels and
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's what gets us through the cold
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
snaps and we're saving those fuels
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
because you know even in the winter The
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
Sun Shines and we don't have to burn
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
quite so much oil okay I think we're
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit off topic for the
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
bill and we do have to move on we have
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
five more speakers here so thank you Mr
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
Sim Evan Brown for your testimony and uh
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for setting the standard I'm
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time I'm going to
 
00:48:43.109 --> 00:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
limit all other speakers to five minutes
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
or less if possible so next one on the
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:49:01.109 align:start position:0%
 
doe

00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh for the record
 
00:49:05.789 --> 00:49:05.799 align:start position:0%
Griffin robers State energy program
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
manager at the department of energy uh
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
all of you should have a letter of
 
00:49:11.789 --> 00:49:11.799 align:start position:0%
testimony from the Department that I had
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
passed out earlier I think some of you
 
00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
maybe weren't in the room when I passed
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
it out um as previously mentioned um the
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this bill as
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's introduced um as has been discussed
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
the bill primarily amends the uh new
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State policy statement in RSA
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
378 colon 37 toward the bottom of page
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
two um it also empowers the department
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
or the Pu to open an investigation into
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
whether the forced retirement of an
 
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
electric generator from a Federal
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
Regulation affects the reliability or
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
affordability of the state's energy
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
resources um and then the department of
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
the Pu May recommend any action
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to defend the generator
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
including appealing to the New Hampshire
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to file an action
 
00:49:56.589 --> 00:49:56.599 align:start position:0%
in court or to participate in
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
administrative proceedings um I do want
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
to note that the department does
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
recognize that RSA 378 colon 37 is a
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
policy statement from the New Hampshire
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
general court but we do have some
 
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:11.240 align:start position:0%
observations on the modified statement
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh some of which has been mentioned in
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
previous testimony um on page one lines
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
29 to 30 to the first two lines on page
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
two um require or I should say state
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
that new hampsh shall promote the
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
development of resources to enhance the
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
state's ability to respond to
 
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:31.589 align:start position:0%
state's ability to respond to
significant

00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
disruptions um New Hampshire does as has
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
been previously mentioned function um in
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
a regional market um New Hampshire
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
certainly does take part in uh
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
advocating at the regional level for
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
State interest but we do want to note
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
that several of the responsibilities on
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
those lines uh are within the previe of
 
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
iso New England again New Hampshire
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
isn't a regional market we do not
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
operate on our own um second secondly um
 
00:50:59.069 --> 00:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
lines 5 to 7 as well as 8 to9
 
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
um might will will uh will conflict with
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
current state Energy Efficiency programs
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
and renewable energy program statutes um
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
so for example lines 8 to9 uh indicate
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
that energy conservation and Energy
 
00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
Efficiency should be based on Market
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
principles without government subsidies
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
um this language does raise question
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
related to um rate payer Fund in Energy
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
Efficiency such as New Hampshire saves
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
especially uh considering the New
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire General Court's action in
 
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
recent years with House Bill 549 and
 
00:51:40.789 --> 00:51:40.799 align:start position:0%
Senate bill uh3 from last year um
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
additionally lines 5 to7 may be in
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
conflict with uh the state policy goal
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
under the renewable portfolio standard
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
to incentivize instate renewable uh
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
energy projects um the state's policy of
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
promoting renewable energy resources has
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
led to a regional market where uh
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates are sold
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
but that market would not exist without
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
government intervention so we did want
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
to note that um and then on the
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph a on page one which
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
is lines 24 to
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
26 and then on page two lines 16 to 17
 
00:52:23.309 --> 00:52:23.319 align:start position:0%
uh conflict with one another in one of
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
these areas New Hampshire is promoting
 
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
the development of resources without
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
preference to technology type but with
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
an emphasis on dispatchable resources
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
while in the other New Hampshire is
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
promoting clean energy sources that may
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be dispatchable like
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
solar or wind so there is an
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
inconsistency there between those two
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
statements um regarding the tail end of
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
page two regarding um an investigation
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
into the Force retirement of electric
 
00:52:52.789 --> 00:52:52.799 align:start position:0%
generators we do want to note that there
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
is no definition of electric generator
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
of what a Federal Regulation is or of
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
what a forced retirement is um given
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is part of a regional
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
grid could we be launching an
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
investigation into an electric generator
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's located in another state such as
 
00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
Connecticut um you know does does the
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
bill only focus on instate generators or
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
out of state generators what constitutes
 
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
a Federal Regulation uh you know is it
 
00:53:22.109 --> 00:53:22.119 align:start position:0%
an is it a federal rule is it an act of
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
Congress um again some of these things I
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
think think would be best uh kind of
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
ironed out with a little bit more
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
clarity if the department takes on this
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh responsibility and then finally um
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
the state investigation the bill does
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
indicate on
 
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
lines 23 I'm sorry 22 to 24 on page two
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
that the department or the Pu may open
 
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
an investigatory docket it may be an
 
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
inadequate use of resources if both the
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
department and the Pu had similar
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
investigations into the same thing um if
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
this bill is to move forward we would
 
00:53:59.069 --> 00:53:59.079 align:start position:0%
suggest striking the pu's involvement in
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
this bill and just shift it over to the
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
department for an investigation um and
 
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
with that that will conclude my
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to take any
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for keeping it just
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
under five minutes
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
plus uh representative um
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you Mr Vice chair and
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
you um you just mentioned that the state
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has promoted wind and
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
solar is that correct
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes under the state's renewable
 
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard follow-up question
 
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
sure followup uh do you have any idea
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
what the accumulated cost of that
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
promotion has been sure thank you for
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
the question so I don't have that number
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but we do include
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
an annual reports on the renewable
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
energy fund happy to share that with the
 
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:47.190 align:start position:0%
energy fund happy to share that with the
committee

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
afterwards represent
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
chran thank you Mr Vice chair thank you
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I was curious
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
to know your interpretation of um on
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
page two lines one through four I guess
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
um do you see compatibility or or
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps contrast between reserves of
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
proven and costeffective reserves versus
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
removing regulatory barriers to
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
Innovation um just those Innovation
 
00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:17.799 align:start position:0%
versus proven um struck me as a little
 
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:20.200 align:start position:0%
bit incompatible and I'm not sure how
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
how would you consider proven um from
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
your Vantage Point sure I I so I I again
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
as I previously mentioned we at the
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
department view this statement as purely
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
a legislative statement within the
 
00:55:33.069 --> 00:55:33.079 align:start position:0%
purview of the New Hampshire General
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
Court um in terms of maintaining
 
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
inadequate Supply including reserves of
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
proven and cost effective dispatchable
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
electricity reserves to meet grid demand
 
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned in my testimony you know
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
that responsibility is largely the
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
perview of iso New England um you know
 
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
to the extent the
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
state takes on these roles it it would
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
be a little bit of a shift from what
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
we've traditionally done
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
but again this is a a policy statement
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
so whatever the legislature deems
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
include representative
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
keplan thank you Mr Vice chair and thank
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr Rober for taking my question I
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up a little bit on
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
representative crean's question about
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
maintaining adequate supply of uh
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
reserves and you you you mention that
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
that would be a major shift and that
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
seems to be uh one of the aspirations of
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
this leg legislative uh of this bill is
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
to you know shift our policy and we can
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
argue about the aspirations and the
 
00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
direction that it's going but it's clear
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
that it conflicts with some of the major
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
policy decisions that the state has
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
undertaken in the last 20 years but just
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
getting back to uh uh say we say that
 
00:56:43.789 --> 00:56:43.799 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire was responsible
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
for maintaining adequate reserves how
 
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
would the state even do that sure sure
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question I guess I
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have an answer for
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
that again this doesn't this policy
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
statement is simply a policy statement
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't impose any specific tasks or
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but it does indicate
 
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:03.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire's or the
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislator's intent that the state will
 
00:57:08.829 --> 00:57:08.839 align:start position:0%
be engaging in these things so if it
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
maybe becomes a policy that is r that is
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
adopted by the legislature and signed
 
00:57:14.829 --> 00:57:14.839 align:start position:0%
into law it is something that you know
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
regulators and folks will be looking to
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
as you know means of undertaking
 
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.990 align:start position:0%
as you know means of undertaking
regulatory

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.029 --> 00:57:24.039 align:start position:0%
action remind the U committee that we
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
have other speakers as well so I'm going
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
to ask I'm going to call on one last
 
00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:30.280 align:start position:0%
question from representative Thomas
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh Vice chair um
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr robes for being here um you
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
testified that this bill um has flaws
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
that the bill has
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies that there's no
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
definitions there's elimination of State
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%
programs and there's uh conflict with
 
00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
ISO New England and there's an
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
inadequate use of resources and yet um
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
the department remains neutral
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
on this bill what would cause you to
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill sure and thank you for
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
the question again as I previously
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
stated this is a policy statement that
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
is adopted by the New Hampshire general
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
court and put into action by legislators
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
such as yourselves um we are respectful
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
of that this committee and other
 
00:58:20.069 --> 00:58:20.079 align:start position:0%
legislators make that determination um I
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to hypothesize on what
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
would make us oppose the bill I can only
 
00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:25.720 align:start position:0%
comment on the language that's in front
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
of me and as of right now we are
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
respectful of you know the dire
 
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
Direction the legislature wants to take
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
in modifying this and we've raised the
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
concerns and folks are certainly welcome
 
00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
to consider that as they potentially
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
amend the
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you with that thank
 
00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony Mr RAR thank you
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to call next on Miss Raley
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
Connors from New England power generator
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:59:06.029 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:59:06.029 --> 00:59:06.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time um for the
 
00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Molly Connors I'm with
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
the New England power generators
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
Association we're here to offer really
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
highlevel feedback on on
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
1623 um and for context um our policy is
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
really or our mission is to support
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
competitive wholesale s electricity
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
markets that are in New England that are
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
run and designed by ISO New England and
 
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
um regulated by um the federal
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
government um and for context throughout
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
New England our our Members Own and
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
operate about
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
27,300 megawatts of generating capacity
 
00:59:47.109 --> 00:59:47.119 align:start position:0%
so it's fair to say that um we we our
 
00:59:48.670 --> 00:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
Members Own and operate the vast
 
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
majority of the power plants um in the
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
in the region and within New Hampshire
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
our Members Own and operate about 4
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
4,300 megaw of generating capacity
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
employing about 1,500 people with
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
Millions paid in state and local taxes
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's important for us to
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
note that our members um own and operate
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
just about every type of generating um
 
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
technology there is they have fossil
 
01:00:15.309 --> 01:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
fuel units but they also have renewable
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
units batteries solar wind Hydro nuclear
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
and um pumped Hydro storage so we offer
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
a wide range of um a wide perspective in
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
that regard regarding technology so I
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
first off I want to say that we really
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the committee is taking
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
time to recognize and discuss the
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
challenges that our generators our
 
01:00:38.829 --> 01:00:38.839 align:start position:0%
members are facing in New England and we
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
want to highlight that they are facing
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
challenges Financial ones however the
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
types of challenges that our members are
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
facing are really
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
economics the vast majority of uh the
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
generating capacity in New England and
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
as was alluded to earlier the generators
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
that are not only providing energy and
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
capacity but frequency services and
 
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
other types of technical support they
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
recover their costs and E and really
 
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
live and die through the wholesale
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
electricity markets and those wholesale
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
electricity markets we have long
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
advocated are undervaluing the services
 
01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
that our Market that our members provide
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
and so we have been working um in New
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
England with a variety of stakeholders
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
including ISO New England to improve the
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
markets and
 
01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:26.839 align:start position:0%
I'm actually here to offer a little bit
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
of good news or something to be
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
optimistic about which is that is in New
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
England and the stakeholders um are are
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
working on improving the markets in a
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
way that are going to we think
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
meaningfully improve the the sort of
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
operating conditions and financial
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
conditions that our members are um
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
making living and dying by and so um we
 
01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
want to say that anything that New
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to do in order to
 
01:01:53.789 --> 01:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
address those Market challenges that our
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
members are facing ing are really best
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
done in collaboration with the other New
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
England states and this is because we
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
think that you know when you work across
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
state lines because our energy moves
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
across state lines the kinds of
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
improvements that you're going to get
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
are going to be more durable and more
 
01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
long lasting and we also just would
 
01:02:14.029 --> 01:02:14.039 align:start position:0%
would caution that the kinds of things
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
that states do outside the wholesale
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
electricity markets they can have
 
01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
unintended adverse consequences and so
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
whenever we go to a state legislature
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
that's talking about doing things out of
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
Market um or outside the wholesale
 
01:02:29.549 --> 01:02:29.559 align:start position:0%
electricity sort of Paradigm we we want
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
to caution and say you might have
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that are um not
 
01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
desirable and I also just in the
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
interest of time want to give a little
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
bit of context regarding the markets
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about the markets
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
that Isa New England runs and are
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
federally regulated that our members are
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
are operating
 
01:02:52.829 --> 01:02:52.839 align:start position:0%
in they are designed to drive Innovation
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
flexibility and efficienc efficiency
 
01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559 align:start position:0%
while also removing risk from captured
 
01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:01.960 align:start position:0%
rate payers and so um over time what the
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity markets have done
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
is Drive prices lower we are actually in
 
01:03:09.789 --> 01:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
a time of relatively low historic prices
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
at the wholesale level and that's
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
because the the Innovations and the
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that market participants
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
are doing are driving the cost to
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
generate electricity down overall that's
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
a good thing that's good for rate payers
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
certainly to have lower price at the
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
wholesale markets um it does create the
 
01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
other challenge though that if you're an
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
older facility that maybe um has um
 
01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
engineering challenges or um hasn't had
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
a lot of um Investments recently you're
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
less likely to be able to recover your
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
costs in the wholesale markets and
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's really the design of the market
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
and in turn the less efficient older
 
01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
units get replaced and the by more
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
efficient faster more Nimble resources
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
in the last 10 years or so nearly 10
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
10,000 megaw of of efficient um Power
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
Generation has come online to replace
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
older less efficient resources and so
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
really the the takeaway is if there is a
 
01:04:08.269 --> 01:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
resource if you have two resources to
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
choose from and one is older and less
 
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
efficient and one is newer and more
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
efficient the market is going to select
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
the newer one because it's going to be
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
more efficient and
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
Costless and so I just want to close by
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
um reiterating our gratitude that you
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
are looking at the challenge that our
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
our members are are facing want to
 
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
reiterate that we are working at the
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
regional level with stakeholders like
 
01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
other generators ISO New England State
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
officials including State officials from
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and officials from across
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
the region on fixing the wholesale
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
markets in a way that they can better
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
better uh remunerate our members for the
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
services that they provide and we
 
01:04:47.870 --> 01:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
encourage New Hampshire to work um
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
collaboratively I know it can be more
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
challenging and more timec consuming but
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
it also leads to more durable um
 
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
improvements and um I'm happy to answer
 
01:04:58.029 --> 01:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
any questions hopefully I hit the Tim
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
right thank you for
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
Testimony I'll take a few questions
 
01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.190 align:start position:0%
Testimony I'll take a few questions
representative

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
partial thank you chair and thank you
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today uh you uh
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that Innovations were driving
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
down the market prices to Historic lows
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
and uh could you cite some examples of
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
those inovit in um Innovations as for my
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
edification um sure well I mean the
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
historic ly famous one that is now less
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
popular in many conversations is that
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
the cost the cost of building and
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
operating a natural gas plant um drove
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
the costs in the wholesale electricity
 
01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
markets down that's because they were
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
more efficient than other existing
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
resources that were older and had more
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
expensive um fuels I know that many
 
01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
would you know rather see an even
 
01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:46.839 align:start position:0%
cleaner resource run but that's an
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
example of of an innovation that was not
 
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
driven by rirs that has driven the
 
01:05:53.269 --> 01:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
prices of electricity at the wholesale
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
level down
 
01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
honest answer sure representative
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
Berardi thank you Mr Vice chair so you
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh asked for collaboration amongst the
 
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:06.839 align:start position:0%
the states do do you think that
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts ban of pipelines is a
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
collaborative uh activity uh to
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
facilitate uh Power Generation in the
 
01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:19.400 align:start position:0%
New England region uh are you referring
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
to the court order several years ago um
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to the the m Massachusetts
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
legislature Banning power uh Banning the
 
01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh creation of new gas pipelines running
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
through the state as well as New York
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
has done the same
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
thing I um I have to admit I'm not
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with that particular law I do
 
01:06:42.109 --> 01:06:42.119 align:start position:0%
know that there was a a decisive Supreme
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
Court decision that said that electric
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
rate pairs cannot subsidize natural gas
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
pipeline which is something within um
 
01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
really about restructuring and who
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
should be bearing what risk what I can
 
01:06:56.349 --> 01:06:56.359 align:start position:0%
say is that in New England the states
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
and really through the federal power act
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
the states have the really have the
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility the authority to decide
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
what resource mix is within their state
 
01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
border and so if you know New Hampshire
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
you know has a disagreement with
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that is the nature of you
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
know sort of State sovereignty which is
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
also at the heart of this law right or
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
the bill in front of us within our state
 
01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
we should have a say and what the
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
resource mix
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
is and that's the reality my members
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
operate in every day okay we really need
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
to move on I'll take representative
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
mck's last question thank you Mr Vice
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
question Miss Connor um so in terms of
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
this legislation that you came out here
 
01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
to testify on um you mentioned in a very
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
delicate way unintended consequences uh
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
operating uh as though it's a regional
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
grid that we're participating in and so
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if if there is a
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
position uh in the power generators
 
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.670 align:start position:0%
position uh in the power generators
Association

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
about whether uh passing this bill as it
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
currently appears would be useful or not
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
helpful to the overall circumstance you
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
you were talking about having outliers
 
01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
with with uh rules that are very
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
different might might be difficult is
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
there anything difficult in this bill
 
01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:14.839 align:start position:0%
that you can point to um well some I I
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
can give high level sort of General
 
01:08:18.269 --> 01:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
feedback and and this came up in the
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
exchange with the Department of energy
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
um sort of you know to the to you never
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
want your power plants when they're
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
operating to have any confusion or um
 
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
conflicting signals about who's who they
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
should be following so in ISO New
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
England and I worked there for many
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
years um I'm partial to ISO New England
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
when they come up with their Market
 
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
rules they are designed to ensure
 
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
reliability and that it is in everyone's
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
best interest for the power plant to do
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
exactly what the control room says and
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
so one thing I would take away is if the
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
iso New England operators are saying
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
don't run we want to hold you in reserve
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
that that there's no ambiguity about
 
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
what a given power plan should be doing
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
because that's critical for reliability
 
01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing I would just
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
remind everyone and we say this
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere um subsidies beget subsidies
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
when you try to prevent a a power plant
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
from retiring one of the things that is
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
an option is to take that power plant
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
out of the markets and just put it on a
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
special contract and that contract is
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to be more expensive than what the
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
wholesale price was and and it's going
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
to make the problems within the
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market where prices are
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
already low even more difficult for the
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
existing members that aren't seeking to
 
01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
retire so there that's the kind of
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence I would allude to
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful yeah well
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony I
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate it we we do have time
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
constraints and I'll move on to Mr Nick
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
coff of the conservation law foundation
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
for his five minutes or less
 
01:09:52.719 --> 01:10:04.149 align:start position:0%
for his five minutes or less
testimony

01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
hey good morning uh my name is Nick
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
croff for the conservation law
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
Foundation um thank you for having me
 
01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:10.830 align:start position:0%
Foundation um thank you for having me
testify

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
today currently under the under the
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
378-3739 policy to favor fossil fuel
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels above all other concerns um
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
it perversely assumes that fossil fuels
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
are good for the environment for the
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
public health and the safety of the
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
state while completely ignoring their
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and their Public
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
Health impacts um as we've heard several
 
01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
times New Hampshire is part of iso New
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
England and I don't agree with a lot
 
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
with what ISO New England does but I
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
think they do a reasonably good job of
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
keeping the lights on for our region so
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
this bill's concern about reliability
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
dispatchability Etc is really misplaced
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
given iso's function um you know what's
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
a far far greater concern is um you know
 
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
that What's happen you know the the
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
effects of fossil fuel use and the
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
continued effects of fossil fuel use um
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
you know as as we're all aware um fossil
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
fuel use is is negatively damaging our
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
climate and is um you know causing
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
negative Health impacts with all the
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
particular matter from from many power
 
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
plants causing asthma health um heart
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
disease other other um netive Health
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
impacts and so you know but this bill
 
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
completely ignores ignores those impacts
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
by you know placing the thumb on the
 
01:11:33.189 --> 01:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
scale in favor of fossil fuels um you
 
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
know and with that in
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
mind um the bill claims to be
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
technologically neutral but you know
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
again as we've heard it contradicts
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
Itself by requiring a um an analysis of
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
the um you know of the life cycle
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
emissions for clean energy Technologies
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
but not a similar analysis for fossil
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
fuels so you know it's not it's not
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
technologically neutral even though it
 
01:11:59.870 --> 01:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
claims to be um and then
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
third fossil fuel plants aren't as
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
dispatchable or as reliable as we've
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
been led to believe um a recent report
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
by synaps uh energy economics found that
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
it takes 12 hours for Marx station to
 
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:15.400 align:start position:0%
turn on so that's not really a
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
dispatchable resource and then we we saw
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
in late 2022 the Christmas Eve storm
 
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
winter um winter storm Elliot you know
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
many oil plants natural gas plants
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
failed to turn on when there was a um
 
01:12:30.790 --> 01:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know a system issue that day and so
 
01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's reliability
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
issues with with natural gas and and oil
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
plants coal plants that are just being
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
glossed over by this um conversely
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
storage combined with Renewables have a
 
01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
you know have more and more potential to
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
provide dispatchability and reliability
 
01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
services to the grid um there's there's
 
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
a new storage project in gorm main being
 
01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
built um that would provide a lot of
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
liability benefits the grid um and then
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
finally last point I want to make is
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
that with respect to this investigation
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
that doe and pu could conduct into um
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
Force retirements I think I understand
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
it a little bit better after
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives Bose as explanation
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
but a lot of a lot of these potential
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
regulations that would be investigated
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know that the remedy that that might
 
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
be um effectuated by Doe or or the Pu
 
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
are going to be preempted by federal law
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
and so you know I I think I understand
 
01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
the the purpose there but you know there
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of federal
 
01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
regulations that the state's not be able
 
01:13:33.149 --> 01:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
to do anything about and so it seems to
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
be a waste of time and uh and resources
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
to require um doe to go through this
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
futile exercise um but thank you very
 
01:13:44.629 --> 01:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
much happy to answer any
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much for your
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh representative
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
kman thank thank you Mr Vice chair and
 
01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr cof for taking my question
 
01:13:56.910 --> 01:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask you a question that I
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have asked this
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
bill's sponsor and then U Mr Evans brown
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't called on but I'm going to
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
ask you for your opinion on this and
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
that is is it even possible to talk
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
about ignoring Market forces and I
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
understand that you know we've already
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
discussed um NH saves as um possibly
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
putting its thumb on Market forces but
 
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
it seems that uh there are other Market
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
forces outside of New Hampshire that
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
influen things such as uh federal tax
 
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
credits for Renewables such as the oil
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
depletion allowance is it even possible
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
to say everything is going to be only
 
01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
Market forces I mean no and I I think
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know that that kind of you
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
know um you know with utility regulation
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's the antithesis of the
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
market you know it's a heavily it's a
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
heavy regulated um you know industry
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
that basically gives utilities a
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
monopoly over over providing gas and
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
electric service and so you know there's
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
not a market there and yeah I I don't
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
think you can really
 
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
divorce um you know what's happening in
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from what's happening at
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
the federal level with with incentives
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
you know e either you know either
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
incentives for clean energy technology
 
01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
or you know the continued failure to um
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
completely completely account for the
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
externalities of of fossil fuel
 
01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
use okay seeing no other questions thank
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'm going to call next on
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
miss m friedricks from Durham
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
representing 350 New Hampshire uh again
 
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
please thank you um everyone for
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
welcoming me to the to the podium this
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
morning um and for hearing me and again
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is m
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
friedricks and I'm representing 350 NH
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to start by um kind of
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
echoing our support for representative
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
vos's statement um when he introduced
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
this bill that the grid is essential the
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
electric grid is essential to human
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
health and stability is in ut utmost
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
importance um in those considerations um
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
but we do have several concerns um where
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
this uh bill as introduced is
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
self-contradictory and some questions
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we would like to um voice for the
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee as well um so the first one um
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
is lines uh eight and n on page two um
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
where it states that New Hampshire shall
 
01:16:32.189 --> 01:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
shall pursue energy conservation and
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
efficiency according to Market
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
principles um and as mentioned by some
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
other um folks today who gave T their
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
testimony um there that in in practice
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
um conflicts with language elsewhere
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
about pursuing affordability cost
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness and low consumer prices
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
because we have seen that there are a
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
number of benefits um when subsidies are
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
used appropriately um such as through
 
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
program um another area of concern um is
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh again page two lines 16 and 17 um as
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
brought up um earlier in testimony today
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
that um you know this this uh Bill
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
states that New Hampshire shall promote
 
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
the use of clean energy sources by
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
considering the emissions of an energy
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
resource throughout the entire life
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
cycle um and yet uh on um in line 25 on
 
01:17:24.669 --> 01:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
page one um we state that there is
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
without preference for technology type
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
and so we do agree with representative
 
01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
's statement earlier in this hearing um
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
that really the entire life cycle should
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
be considered for all energy types and
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
not for only clean energy um I also
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to um add that there's concern
 
01:17:44.830 --> 01:17:44.840 align:start position:0%
that um this bill would add a Le a level
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
of government intervention um in
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
addition uh sorry that is not limited
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
narrow or necessary because we do
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
already have have um the Pu um acting in
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
on behalf of New Hampshire in
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
coordination with regional authorities
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
um I also have the the experience of
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
having lived in Argentina for um almost
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
10 years of my adult life which I think
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
has become famous for its economic
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
crisis and in that experience I really
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
learned firsthand that when regulation
 
01:18:15.679 --> 01:18:16.590 align:start position:0%
learned firsthand that when regulation
and

01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
administration becomes political that
 
01:18:22.510 --> 01:18:22.520 align:start position:0%
that is the most destabilizing Force um
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
in ex distance and really um when we
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
make our our um our Administration and
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
um our regulation of of things like our
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
utilities uh a political Choice then
 
01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
that is destabilizing um to the economy
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
and um to our society um we have some
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
questions about who would pay um to keep
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
a generator running if they were noticed
 
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
um because given that uh right now we
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
operate in uh a regional grid
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
um and the payment comes through the
 
01:18:58.430 --> 01:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
regional grid if um a facility was
 
01:19:00.629 --> 01:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
instructed to shut down um through some
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory body at the regional or
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
federal level um what would happen in
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the payment to keep that
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
facility running would it be New
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers then that are
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
continuing to operate that facility um
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
entire on tax entirely on taxpayer money
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
um while a decision is made about
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not that facility should um
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
should be shut down
 
01:19:27.310 --> 01:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
and then um lastly we share some uh
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
concerns about the use of the word
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
dispatchable throughout this text um
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
because it's really unclear if you have
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
one site that is a battery storage
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
facility and that is operated by a
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
separate owner from something that is a
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
renewable facility um and yet those two
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
can operate in conjunction to provide
 
01:19:48.669 --> 01:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
dispatchable energy how is that being
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
considered um and that's really unclear
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the language that is provided here um
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we also um Echo concerns
 
01:19:59.830 --> 01:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
um previously stated uh about replacing
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
the the language from 378 uh colon 37
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
because that definition was um reviewed
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
last year and decided that it was really
 
01:20:11.550 --> 01:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
the best possible language so reopening
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
that and revisiting that this year does
 
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
not seem a prudent um course of action
 
01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.590 align:start position:0%
not seem a prudent um course of action
thank

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Kenny
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thank you Mr Vice chair and
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned the impact of political forces
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
would you say there are political forces
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
here behind the promotion of wind and
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
solar um I think when when I made that
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
statement what I was really looking at
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
is um I think we want to be very careful
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
about sending conflicting messages to um
 
01:20:51.910 --> 01:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
businesses who operate as public
 
01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
utilities and to all of the businesses
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
and people who rely on the electric grid
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
um if we have um sort of fighting
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
occurring between um the the New
 
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state government and the other
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies that oversee our
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
regional grid so that's really the
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
political instability that um that I was
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
speaking to here follow
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
up yeah I may have misinterpreted what
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
you were meaning by political
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
instability but could you still answer
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
the question um I don't feel like I have
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
any information to answer that question
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
so my answer would be no but um I I
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
don't feel well enough informed to to
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
explain why that would be no it would be
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
based on I I don't have any information
 
01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.110 align:start position:0%
based on I I don't have any information
on

01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
partiel thank you chair and thank you
 
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um you were speaking
 
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
of Market forces and sometimes my
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
feeling is that market forces would tell
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
me the best way to heat my house is to
 
01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:49.719 align:start position:0%
burn it down without really thinking
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
about what I'm going to be doing
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um and this leads to my
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
question do you feel that there's an
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate role for our legislature to
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
protect the interest of the public both
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
environmentally and E economically by
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
riging in some Market forces when they
 
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.229 align:start position:0%
riging in some Market forces when they
become

01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
excessive um I absolutely do think that
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature plays an important role
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
in protecting the Health and Welfare of
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents and I think that
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
that role is um you know happens through
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
the the the bills um that are put forth
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
and are decided on by our legislature so
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
I think um you know as stated in others
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and I do not pretend to be an
 
01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:35.199 align:start position:0%
expert by any means on um you know on
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
the the electric grid and that's why I
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
kind of stated that um we we wanted to
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
share some comments and some questions
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
that we had uh because I think some
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
other folks have have much greater
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
expertise when they shared their
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
testimony but um I I can um you know uh
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
agree that
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
the public utilities is an unusual space
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
and that because it does not operate
 
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
entirely on Market forces um it is a
 
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
legal Monopoly which would not be a
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
Market Force um there are tighter
 
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
regulations that are that are imposed in
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
order to counterbalance that so um
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's the the best that I can um
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
respond to that question that's adate
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much seeing that other
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming down here again I'm
 
01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
going to call on the next speaker and I
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
I'll make this comment we've had a lot
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
of test Tony here today on this bill and
 
01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh we're beginning uh we we're hearing
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
the same testimonies uh involving their
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
same concerns on same portions of of the
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
bill so on uh your rest of the
 
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
testifiers if you could just merely
 
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
agree with some of the concerns that
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
have been previously stated and if we
 
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
have any new information to to talk
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
about we would certainly be glad to hear
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
that with that being said I'm going to
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
ask on Miss Heidi croll to come up here
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.950 --> 01:23:59.960 align:start position:0%
Association welcome thank you Mr
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
chairman uh good morning everyone for
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Heidi croll I work
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
at Gallagher cahan and gartell and I'm
 
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
representing the granite state hydr
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
Power Association here today before you
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
I will be brief um we do um share some
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that have been raised by
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
other speakers here before me today um
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
we appreciate the um focus on uh
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
resilience and reliability um and in
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
part we think that comes from um
 
01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
diversity of resources and we just
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that um the word
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
diversity has actually been removed it's
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
in it's in current law but we don't see
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
the word diversity in the bill um but uh
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
the word dispatchable appears seven
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
times and from a um Hydro run of river
 
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
perspective we just wanted to share that
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
you know technically we are not
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
dispatchable um in the sense that other
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know kind of the traditional sense
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
um but run of river is very reliable it
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
has some seasonal variability um but
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
generally uh it's running 247 unless
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of mechanical problem
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
with the facility so um you know we just
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to um say that we would have some
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
concerns with the with the emphasis on
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
dispatchability um and also had the same
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
flag that Doe brought up about um uh
 
01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:23.639 align:start position:0%
this legislation versus the RPS law RPS
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
law with that um happy to answer any
 
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
questions and I will we briefy New Year
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
on a time schedule thank you very much
 
01:25:35.310 --> 01:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
I'll call on representative U Thomas's
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr chair um I understand
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
you have some concerns um can you
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
clarify do oppose or uh support this
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh we are opposed as
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
introduced thank you representative
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned that
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
diversity leads to increased
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
reliability but would you say that
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
adding an unreliable resource to the mix
 
01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.189 align:start position:0%
adding an unreliable resource to the mix
increases

01:26:06.189 --> 01:26:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
reliability well I think we come at it
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of um you know it's
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
kind of like your finances uh when
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
you're going with a portfolio um you
 
01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
know different different resources have
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
different strengths and different
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
weaknesses um and depending on what's
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
happening in the markets happening with
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
weather um a whole variety of factors um
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
the diversity I think does overall um
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
bring some strength and and resilience
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:26:36.669 --> 01:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
grid thank you seeing none others thank
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony appreciate it and
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh we will call on the last testifier Mr
 
01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
John Gage representing himself and again
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
please limit to 5 minutes or less with
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
any new testimony that you may have
 
01:26:50.159 --> 01:26:51.189 align:start position:0%
any new testimony that you may have
thank

01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:27:00.149 align:start position:0%
thank
you

01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman thank you
 
01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.870 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman thank you
committee

01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm John Gage from Windham
 
01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
represented myself uh I agree with all
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
of the opposition uh testimony that has
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
um I guess uh starting with the um the
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
idea of this as being an energy
 
01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
Independence bill um it seems like this
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
is the opposite to me uh it ties us
 
01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
further to the fossil fuel industry um
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
if we were striving for energy
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
Independence in a state we would be
 
01:27:39.109 --> 01:27:39.119 align:start position:0%
heavily investing in Energy
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
Efficiency um wind and solar and Battery
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh and a smarter grid that would let
 
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
micro grids and
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.229 --> 01:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh diversity of energy sources is
 
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
hurting us right now we we are heavily
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
reliant on gas for our electricity
 
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
because of the regional production and
 
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
we felt that a couple years ago when our
 
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
prices spiked due to the volatility of
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
the gas market
 
01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:15.270 align:start position:0%
the gas market
globally

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
globally
 
01:28:18.070 --> 01:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
um I was a software developer for 35
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
years and uh yes elegant code is what
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
software developers strive for in my
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
group we used to say we need clean crisp
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
code and it's interesting looking at
 
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
legislature because it's very much like
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
software software you have a grammar and
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
you write rules and then things execute
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
through it and work gets done in
 
01:28:45.790 --> 01:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
legislature is the same way you write
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
rules and things
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
happen um we had a term for code that
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
was not well written and simple uh
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
spaghetti code um so there may be some
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislature that you could consider
 
01:29:05.950 --> 01:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
spaghetti code also um with hidden
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
motives and trying to tip the the scale
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
in certain ways that causes problems in
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
markets there's a lot of discussion
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
about Market forces and market pricing
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
language but nothing about the market
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
failure um the largest market failure in
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
the history of human civilization
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
according to Sir Nicholas Stern in the
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
stern report the external costs of using
 
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.189 align:start position:0%
stern report the external costs of using
fossil

01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
fossil
 
01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
fuels um these are not reflected in the
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
price of fossil fuels and this is a
 
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
market failure a classic market failure
 
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
from pollution and we're struggling
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
under that market failure right now
 
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of legislation trying to
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
deal with it in different
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
ways but there's a heavy influence of
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
the fossil fuel industry
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
um the Koch Network front
 
01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
groups trying to continue their social
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
engineering which has been going on for
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
decades to avoid us dealing with their
 
01:30:06.109 --> 01:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
pollution from accepting it to
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
regulating it and now we're even
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
ignoring what's going on in the rest of
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
the world uh in the United States and
 
01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
specifically New Hampshire the handout
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
that I just provided to you has a couple
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
graphs from the state and trends of
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
carbon pricing report from the world
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
Bank this body may not like talking
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
about carbon pricing very much uh it's a
 
01:30:31.149 --> 01:30:31.159 align:start position:0%
tax on energy right that's what the
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel industry wants to call it
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
economists say we're internalizing the
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
external costs of the pollution from
 
01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and their price so that we
 
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
get efficient market forces providing
 
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
the best benefits to
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
all carbon pricing is spreading around
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
the world it's in 23% of all fossil fuel
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
sold right now 73 73 countries and
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
regions are pricing carbon and that's
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
triple what it was a decade ago and
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
prices are rising and Border carbon
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
adjustments are starting in Taiwan and
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
soon in the EU countries are going to
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
start charging us exporters their carbon
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
price when we export goods into their
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
Market the EU has a price of $85 per ton
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the the low watermark for a safe
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
future is $135 per ton of CO2 emitted in
 
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
2030 Canada is using cash back carbon
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
pricing to hit that Target and the EU is
 
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:35.480 align:start position:0%
rising rapidly will obviously be closer
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
above that also and these countries are
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to start charging the US exporters
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
their carbon price this is
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
spreading I I want our state not to keep
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
its head in the sand about this we
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
should anticipate a federal carbon price
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
sometime this day
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
decade so back to
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
Simplicity carbon pricing is the
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
simplest way to to deal with pollution
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
because if you charge the fossil fuel
 
01:32:07.590 --> 01:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
industry a polluter fee the cost of
 
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
pollution is reflected in the price of
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
everything this
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
incentivizes clean energy and Energy
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
Efficiency um and it's going to happen
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
to us and New Hampshire is not going to
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
have a say about whether it happens but
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
we can anticipate it
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
so Market forces are great but when
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's incorrect pricing in a market
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
you make bad decisions if you just base
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
your decisions on current
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
prices so I would rewrite this whole
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
say let's leave RSA
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
378.5 s alone it sounds like an elegant
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
explanation of what our uh energy agenda
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
is um what we should do for State energy
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
policy is simply anticipate a minimum
 
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
federal carbon price coming at us the
 
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
document that I gave you gave the price
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
Model that we a very conservative one
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
that's happening around the world um by
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
anticipating this we would invest in
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency we would stop trying
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
to prop up fossil fuel energy we would
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
start accelerating our efforts to figure
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
out how to modernize our grid to prepare
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
for things like what Mr Sam Evans Brown
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
so eloquently spoke about in an energy
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
conference last year virtual power
 
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
producers batteries spread out which can
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
work together with software and provide
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
dispatchable energy cheaply so thank you
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony I'd be happy to
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you m Gage
 
01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:46.470 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you m Gage
you

01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh exceeded 5 minutes just a little bit
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
but you're able to sum up something
 
01:33:53.709 --> 01:33:53.719 align:start position:0%
about the bill in a few seconds so so
 
01:33:57.149 --> 01:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um seeing no other questions
 
01:33:58.990 --> 01:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
having no other pink cards I declare the
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh public hearing for 1623 closed
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
Point did I a quick question if I
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
could and the bell we um one of my
 
01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
constituents has asked if we could read
 
01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
the online uh the uh results of the
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
online submissions and how many people
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
signed it on the blue sheet
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm wonder if we're still doing
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe we're not reading
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
the online submissions but we can report
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
the results of blue sheet if if we have
 
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
it I'm sorry Vice chair um today I don't
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
have my electronic device and our
 
01:34:43.550 --> 01:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
assistant is not available I could give
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
you the blue sheet or the online
 
01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:47.560 align:start position:0%
submissions if you would like I I will
 
01:34:50.470 --> 01:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
get the blue sheet thank you
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
okay there'll be a short intermission
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%

okay let's open a public hearing on
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1487 relative to the health
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
health effects of 5G technology and I'll
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
ask representative geard the prime
 
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor to introduce this
 
01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%

report
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
there are there's a number of
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations and I did not want to
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
print out a ton of paper so I sent a
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
link in your email to the 5G commission
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
report if you want to follow along it's
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
Pages 9 through 9 through 17 are
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
basically what we'll be working
 
01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
from so starting from the
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
beginning this let's let's start from
 
01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:47.870 align:start position:0%
beginning this let's let's start from
beginning

01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:36:49.950 --> 01:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
beginning I don't want to claim that I'm
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
an expert on the effects
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
of not just 5G but the Wi-Fi and
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
cellular radiation in
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
general what this seeks to do is simply
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
alert the public to
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
the the amount of radiation that they're
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
receiving and allowing them to make the
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
decision if they wish
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
to well basically take it in and if not
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
then at least they'll know how to avoid
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
it and where it's being at the highest
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
levels so
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
the on line 10 we start with the
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
shall include links on the department
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
website that conclud uh contains
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
information about radio frequency
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
radiation from all sources including 5G
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
small cells deployed on public rights
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
away such information shall Al also
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
contain guidance on the proper use of
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
cell phones to minimize exposure to RF
 
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
radiation simple there's simple things
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
we can do as well simply putting phones
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
on airplane mode when putting them
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
against your body in your pocket things
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
to minimize radiation exposure that
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't really require much effort but it
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
does take knowledge and I didn't know
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
about that simple trick until
 
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
researching this so we also have public
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
service announcements on radio
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
television media to warn women
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
newborns and well really pregnant women
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
is what I meant to say about the
 
01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.750 align:start position:0%
is what I meant to say about the
potential

01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
harms and this is something I'm
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
particularly uh excited about is line 17
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
number three the Department of
 
01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services shall develop
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
exposure warning signs for posting in
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
commercial and public buildings
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
concerning RF radiation levels just to
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
allow people to know what they're being
 
01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:36.070 align:start position:0%
allow people to know what they're being
exposed

01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
to that's from recommendation recom uh
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation 13 recommendation three
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
which is on line 19 the Department of
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
invironmental Services shall require
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
that every poll or other structure in
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
the public rights away holding a 5G
 
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
antenna to be labeled in indicating RF
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
radiation being emitted from the antenna
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
such label shall be posted at eye level
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
and printed in such a way that is
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
away I I just don't I know we're way
 
01:39:07.589 --> 01:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
behind schedule I don't want to go
 
01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:09.320 align:start position:0%
through everything I'm trying
 
01:39:12.910 --> 01:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
to cover the ones that I think
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
are very simple to implement and very
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
important the line let's go to page two
 
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
line six home inspectors shall be
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
trained to measure the intensity of RF
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
radiation when doing inspections home
 
01:39:28.229 --> 01:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
inspectors shall send measurements of RF
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
radiation to the Department of
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services for publication
 
01:39:34.589 --> 01:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
on a map of state exposure levels that
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
way people will now be able to see where
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
radiation exposure is the most and I
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
think that when people are buying homes
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
that is something that they should know
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
about if they know about mold and other
 
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
possibly harmful elements to their
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
health then I think radiation exposure
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
is something something that should be
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
known as
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
well then I know the from the previous
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
terms HB 1644 dealing with setbacks for
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
wireless Towers this line 11 15 this is
 
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
a 1500t setback for new wireless
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
antenna and we
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
have on line 15 this is from
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation 14 recommendation 4 I'm
 
01:40:21.910 --> 01:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
sorry the board shall develop a plan to
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
be implemented in every school district
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
to migrate from wireless internet
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
connections for computers laptops
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
tablets and other wireless devices to
 
01:40:30.149 --> 01:40:30.159 align:start position:0%
internet connections that are either
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
hardwired or Optical connections within
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
5 years so obviously we can't transition
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
everything immediately but to to Simply
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
start moving away from Wi-Fi systems to
 
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
hardwired or Optical and
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully get away from the
 
01:40:54.990 --> 01:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
Wi-Fi systems that are not beneficial to
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
human life and
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
Wildlife um and that also is for
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
chartered schools as
 
01:41:05.589 --> 01:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
well and that's that's basically the
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
bill I mean there's more to it there's a
 
01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:08.390 align:start position:0%
bill I mean there's more to it there's a
couple

01:41:08.390 --> 01:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
couple
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
more for on page one real quick let's go
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
over and we have time 23 P line
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
23 doing signal measurements around
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
Wireless facilities in order to evaluate
 
01:41:22.350 --> 01:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
signal characteristics
 
01:41:25.270 --> 01:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
and the rules take into account the
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
impulsive nature of high data rate
 
01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
radiation that's different than simply
 
01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:30.510 align:start position:0%
radiation that's different than simply
steady

01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
steady
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
rate and that's exact that's basically
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
it I'll take questions but I I don't
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
want to Caan to be an expert on this I
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
simply came across the 5G commission
 
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
report I know a lot of people there's
 
01:41:43.229 --> 01:41:43.239 align:start position:0%
several people here that came to testify
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
in support of this and we're concerned
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
about the health effects and don't feel
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
that ignoring the the potential human
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
effects is something we can continue to
 
01:41:54.639 --> 01:42:02.750 align:start position:0%
effects is something we can continue to
do

01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you uh representative
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
Kaplan had a question for you yeah thank
 
01:42:10.510 --> 01:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chair and thank you
 
01:42:12.229 --> 01:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative Gart for coming in I just
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
have a quick question did you base this
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
legislation on any other templates from
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
other states or do you know of any other
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
states that are carrying out similar
 
01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.350 align:start position:0%
states that are carrying out similar
legislation

01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
no this is from the 5G commission report
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
that was you know commissioned by the
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
governor and it's simply taking the
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
there's a 300 page report and I don't
 
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
understand why we went through all the
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
effort of having a commission all those
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
hours of study just to walk away from it
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
and that's I just I think this deserves
 
01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
a hearing by a competent body and I'm
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
not claiming to be the competent expert
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
but I feel that the people on the
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
commission were and this deserves a
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.030 align:start position:0%
commission were and this deserves a
hearing

01:42:52.030 --> 01:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative geart it's nice to see
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
you again um when you asked us to go
 
01:43:01.229 --> 01:43:01.239 align:start position:0%
take a look at the report because you
 
01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
sent the link I I did as you instructed
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that when you sent us to
 
01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
page 19 it's a section of the report
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
that's uh titled Minority Report so the
 
01:43:11.679 --> 01:43:12.910 align:start position:0%
that's uh titled Minority Report so the
15

01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations before that were
 
01:43:19.229 --> 01:43:19.239 align:start position:0%
from no what are you oh I I I said not
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
page nine but I'm sorry
 
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
oh you said page nine page nine is
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that where the
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation start okay okay um all
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
right I might have misspoke I'm
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
having because I went right there okay I
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
was just GNA say it looks like there was
 
01:43:37.589 --> 01:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
a sort of a subcommittee that did
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
separate work um and there are
 
01:43:43.589 --> 01:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
um there are footnotes on the page that
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
say the commission discussions indicated
 
01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
the commission was comprised of many
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
individuals had who had preconceived
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
opinions about the safety of RF devices
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
and wireless technology in general and
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
due to many factors experts in favor of
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
Wireless technology were cut short from
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
participating um while other experts uh
 
01:44:06.189 --> 01:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
who were opposing RF devices were
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
allowed to to testify so it just goes on
 
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
to kind of say that it wasn't
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily A an evenly balanced effort
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know if were you involved in the
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
effort or are you just referring to the
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
report that came out of that sub
 
01:44:23.310 --> 01:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
committee I'm referring to the report
 
01:44:25.589 --> 01:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
that came out of the full body the full
 
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
but you weren't you weren't on it right
 
01:44:31.149 --> 01:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
no this is back in 2020 okay thank
 
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Thomas has a question
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um re I'm just
 
01:44:40.109 --> 01:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the practicality of of this
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
um of this proposed Bill sure on lines
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
um page two lines 4 through five and
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
it's just this whole the home inspector
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I assume when you mean home home
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
inspector you also mean building analyst
 
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
but it talks about how they're going to
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
be required to report RF
 
01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639 align:start position:0%
radiation so an uh an EMF detector costs
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
about $500 so um the co who pays for the
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
cost of that who does the training that
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
that you reference in the bill and who
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:15.719 --> 01:45:17.950 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
so this is from recommendation eight
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's page two it's sort of like it
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
starts at like line four no no I
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
understand I was trying to preface what
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
I was going to say so this is from
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation 8 and this is the full
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the report was
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
upgrade the educational offerings by the
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire office of professional
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
license certification for home
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
inspectors to include RF intensity
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
measurements home inspectors currently
 
01:45:42.990 --> 01:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
operate as private contractors who may
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
be hired by citizens or Enterprises to
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
measure such things as radon to collect
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
water samples or search for mold or
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
insect damage home inspectors routinely
 
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
Supply test results to both their
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
clients and government entities the
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
majority of the commission believes the
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
public has a right to discover on a
 
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis the RF power intensity
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
related to radio frequencies at a
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
property which they will be purchasing
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
or renting before the transaction is
 
01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
closed also the Proprietors of publicly
 
01:46:10.350 --> 01:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
accessible venues may wish to reassure
 
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
the public about the RF power intensity
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
within their establishments by posting
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
the data collected by a state approved
 
01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
inspector in addition such testing sh
 
01:46:20.430 --> 01:46:20.440 align:start position:0%
should be paid for by the party
 
01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
requesting it and the testing itself
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
should be performed by a professional
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
who owns or rents the test equipment and
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
has met the state requirements for
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
training of home inspectors regarding RF
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
measurements the majority of the
 
01:46:33.629 --> 01:46:33.639 align:start position:0%
commission proposes that home inspectors
 
01:46:37.149 --> 01:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
be offered training by NH oplc on how to
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
measure the on-site Peak and 24-hour
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
average RF intensities measurements of
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
frequencies and intensities will be
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
performed using lowcost equipment such
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
as GQ 390
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
MERS okay
 
01:46:52.589 --> 01:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
followup yes follow up all right on my
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
second uh concern about practicality is
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
in lines 15 through 18 where you say the
 
01:47:00.030 --> 01:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
board shall develop a plan to implement
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
in every school district I assume that
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
means public school yeah um to mitigate
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
from wireless internet connection for
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
computers laptops tablets and other
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
wireless devices to inter internet
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
connections that are hardwired or
 
01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
Optical connections is there a carve out
 
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
or would this impact specialed students
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
communication I'm well I mean I first
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
the easiest answer would be that you
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
guys at the committee you guys can
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
change the bill as you see fit but I
 
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know there was a need for that I
 
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
never that didn't occur to me so I'll
 
01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
have to admit that much if you want I
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
can read the recommendation from the
 
01:47:43.950 --> 01:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
actual report if no that's fine that's
 
01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
fine thank you pretty
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
sure representative Kennedy has a
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question um you
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
know the the gist of the bill as far as
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
I see it is that you would like the
 
01:48:03.149 --> 01:48:03.159 align:start position:0%
state to intervene to you know reduce or
 
01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
even eliminate wireless
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
communication and I think that's a
 
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
pretty tall order but um do you think
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's Justified for the state to do
 
01:48:14.109 --> 01:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
that given the the percentage of the
 
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
public that has this
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
concern I think that's a
 
01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:20.830 align:start position:0%
concern I think that's a
mischaracterization

01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
I think the public should
 
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
know the radio
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
frequency levels that they're being
 
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:33.070 align:start position:0%
frequency levels that they're being
exposed

01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
to okay um representative Ley has a
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
you representative I noticed that there
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
are a number of things here that would
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
be mandated um and they will cost money
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
and why is there no fiscal
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right seeing no
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
further questions thank uh
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gerard for U introducing
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
kukk welcome to
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
sdn Good morning thank you um I'm just a
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
regular old guy from the street not a
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
scientist not into Technologies very
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
largely but um there is a cell tower
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
that is approximately 90 ft from the
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
corner of my
 
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
home and I've been renting there for 12
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
years now next week it'll be 12 years um
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
homes in the neighborhood people have
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
moved in and purchase those
 
01:49:48.189 --> 01:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
homes and I've become friendly with my
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
neighbors have always been
 
01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
they end up moving out now the tower
 
01:49:56.109 --> 01:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
stands let's say it's
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
here I'm very close to it but all of
 
01:50:04.350 --> 01:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
these people are within 1,500 1200
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
children that lived in one of these
 
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
homes uh was fantastic and she came down
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
with brain cancer and her vision was
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
going away at 6 years old and they
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
packed up and moved out U another
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
Resident moved into a different house
 
01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:29.639 align:start position:0%
that house has been moved out of three
 
01:50:32.510 --> 01:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
times and they said there's something
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
wrong here there's something wrong with
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
the energy well my cousin worked in the
 
01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
military developing weapons and he told
 
01:50:44.069 --> 01:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
me about the dangers of
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic um energy and radiant
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
energy and he sent me this little
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
meter I walk outside with this and hold
 
01:50:59.069 --> 01:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
it up like this and it starts
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
screaming you hold it next to your phone
 
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:05.320 align:start position:0%
it does a little bit of light beeping
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
you hold it next to a microwave that's
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
running it goes off like that
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
Tower this little machine has prove to
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
me how
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
unsafe this energy is that comes off of
 
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:23.320 align:start position:0%
these towers forget the money that the
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
towers make and the ne necessity for
 
01:51:29.109 --> 01:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
communications and this and that these
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
are very dangerous to people 5G operates
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
at a wavelength that is used by the
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
military for damaging or burning the
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
skin of other human beings and they use
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
it they point of that people for crowd
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
control and they can move the people
 
01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:49.679 align:start position:0%
around um so that's basically what I
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to say um also with this little
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
tool came this
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
guide and it spells out here and I only
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
very quickly
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
read um all the things that have
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
happened to these neighbors they've got
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
listed here for this machine being one
 
01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
of the causes of leukemia for children
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
can cause cancer and accelerate
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
proliferation of cancer cells cause
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
direct harm to the human General system
 
01:52:22.030 --> 01:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
male and female nervous system and
 
01:52:24.669 --> 01:52:24.679 align:start position:0%
immune system can cause mental
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities of children dimin of vision
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
affect tissue development and skeletal
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
development of children this is a pretty
 
01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:35.350 align:start position:0%
development of children this is a pretty
mean

01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
stuff um can cause uh liver problems and
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
one of the main causes of card uh card
 
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
vascular disease and
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
diabetes um so if anybody here has a lap
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
top I would just like to hold this in
 
01:52:55.069 --> 01:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
front of the laptop and let you see the
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:58.239 --> 01:53:02.629 align:start position:0%
 
them

01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you maybe you could do that
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
offline uh out in the hallway I don't
 
01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate for right here in
 
01:53:09.079 --> 01:53:18.750 align:start position:0%
think it's appropriate for right here in
the

01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee Mr retti would you please uh
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
take your seat thank you thank you
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:56.669 align:start position:0%
 
CTI

01:53:56.669 --> 01:53:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.310 --> 01:53:59.320 align:start position:0%
morning I'm Andrew Thatcher I'm a board
 
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
certified health physicist and I'm here
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
to talk in strong opposition to the
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill I'm just going to go at a
 
01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
high level there because we've only got
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
a couple minutes get to
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me
 
01:54:18.270 --> 01:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
okay so the proposed bill is worried
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
about fifth gener eration technology but
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
5G includes 600 MHz 2500 MHz 5.5 GHz the
 
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
600 mahz used to be part of the UHF TV
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
Spectrum until
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
2018 the 2.4 2.5 GHz 5.5 GHz that's part
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the Wi-Fi networks we have in just
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
about every home and just about every
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
office building so I think the concern
 
01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
probably is related to millimeter wave
 
01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
the higher newer frequencies that are
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
used in 5G and so just at a high level
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about those exposures
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
briefly so millimeter waves which could
 
01:55:06.750 --> 01:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
be 24 28 gigahertz 37 39 GHz
 
01:55:09.629 --> 01:55:09.639 align:start position:0%
currently that's about 100,000 times
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
less energetic than the minimum energy
 
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
necessary which is ultra violet light to
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
cause any kind of genetic damage other
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
than tissue heating which is the basis
 
01:55:22.229 --> 01:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
of our standards which were
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
recently updated late 2019 same uh with
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
the worldwide itner regulations those
 
01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:29.910 align:start position:0%
the worldwide itner regulations those
were

01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
2020 so these 5G antennas for the
 
01:55:35.790 --> 01:55:35.800 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave antennas they're beam
 
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
forming antennas so they only have an
 
01:55:42.589 --> 01:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
antenna directed at a user and nobody
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
else and because they're using those
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
antennas just to an individual person
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
the output power from the individual
 
01:55:53.709 --> 01:55:53.719 align:start position:0%
antennas is about a tenth of a watt so
 
01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
even if I were standing in front of an
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
antenna array and let's say we've got 64
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
antennas in there I'm a few feet away
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
that total exposure is no more than a
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
handheld walkie Taki I use when I go
 
01:56:09.149 --> 01:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
hiking so you were talking about five
 
01:56:12.669 --> 01:56:12.679 align:start position:0%
six Watts total so combined with all
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
other exposures the 5G millimeter waves
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
is a negligible contribution to exposure
 
01:56:20.510 --> 01:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
there's just not a lot there
 
01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:23.719 align:start position:0%
um as far as the bill goes I could go
 
01:56:25.550 --> 01:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
into a lot of details I obviously don't
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
have time for that there are expert
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
reviews that are done every single year
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
sponsored by health organizations or
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
governmental those are all available
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
I've in my written testimony gave a few
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
examples of citations for those uh the
 
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
instruments that are used for those and
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
I do own one those are over $10,000 for
 
01:56:48.189 --> 01:56:48.199 align:start position:0%
the instruments to do accurate
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
measurements for this it cost a couple
 
01:56:52.910 --> 01:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
thousand for calibration these are not
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
cheap instruments home inspectors are
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
not able to generally operate things
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
like this they simply cost a whole lot
 
01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
of money um I'll open it up to questions
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for your time thank you
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
for coming here today and giving us your
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
written and spoken testimony appreciate
 
01:57:14.109 --> 01:57:14.119 align:start position:0%
that questions from the committee
 
01:57:14.119 --> 01:57:15.550 align:start position:0%
that questions from the committee
representative

01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
maybe you can help out a little bit here
 
01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
because you know we've been dealing with
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
this issue now for a number of years it
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
was a study bill before this and we
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
continue to get two dynamically opposed
 
01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:31.639 align:start position:0%
positions one is from people like
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
yourself that say that there is no
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
Health effect and that uh guidelines are
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
in effect and so forth and so on and
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's not an issue and then with the
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
other people that say it's totally
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
ruining their lives so uh I understand
 
01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
you have a very impressive background in
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
health physics but why do these people
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
people think it's ruining their lives if
 
01:57:53.629 --> 01:57:53.639 align:start position:0%
there is no Health threat that that's a
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
great question I mean I've been working
 
01:57:58.990 --> 01:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
in this field for 30 almost 35 years I'm
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
an expert Adent for the state of Hawaii
 
01:58:06.189 --> 01:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with 5G right now actually so
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's in my experience it's been
 
01:58:12.669 --> 01:58:12.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge that actually reduces the the
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
concerns a lot of times I'll give talks
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
for two or three hours and and walk
 
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
through the exposures walk through the
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
fact that uh these are just radio waves
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
they're the same thing that we've been
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
using since the 20s or 30s so the fact
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
that it's digitized or or it's
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
continuous or analog doesn't really
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
change the fact that it's just pure
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
energy and and what really matters is
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of energy being deposited the
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
basis of the standards is solely based
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
on heat and it's not because we haven't
 
01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
been trying to find other causes or
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
other impacts uh from the exposures it's
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
simply the fact that there's just pure
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
energy and the basis as far as the cells
 
01:58:59.950 --> 01:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
concern we do a lot of androgenous
 
01:59:02.229 --> 01:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
exogenous heat is generated in our
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
cellular level all the time you have to
 
01:59:07.149 --> 01:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
overcome a given amount of that for it
 
01:59:09.069 --> 01:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
to even be meaningful but the standards
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
are very protective for all ages there
 
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
was a recent um report or summary uh for
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
pregnant women which was mentioned and
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
that was just published in October
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
2023 and it reaffirms that the only
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
adverse effects are at levels that are
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
like 60 to 250 times what the allowable
 
01:59:35.470 --> 01:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
public limit is so followup followup and
 
01:59:37.709 --> 01:59:37.719 align:start position:0%
just to be clear we're dealing here with
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
100% nonionizing radiation correct I you
 
01:59:43.629 --> 01:59:43.639 align:start position:0%
know they use radiation I'm a nucle
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
engineer by training uh from the Navy so
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm I'm used to the term radi
 
01:59:51.390 --> 01:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
because I do in medical world in
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
ionizing radiation this isn't really
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
radiation it's simply a radio wave and
 
01:59:59.669 --> 01:59:59.679 align:start position:0%
and honestly it's it's not heartful I
 
02:00:01.709 --> 02:00:01.719 align:start position:0%
know that the millimeter waves are new
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
but back in the 70s can microwave ovens
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
were new and there was huge concerns
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
about we're putting cancer boxes in our
 
02:00:10.589 --> 02:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
kitchens and I don't think anyone
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
believes that anymore it's simply a new
 
02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
technology a new application but it's
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki has a question um
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:00:28.430 --> 02:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question um can you give us
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
some idea of what the depth of
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
penetration is of various things at
 
02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
various frequencies and Powers uh for
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
instance at a 100 um you know uh you
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
know low frequency AM radio penetration
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
to uh 23 GHz thanks for letting me do
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
that because I forgot to mention that so
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
let's go to higher the millimeter waves
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh at 24 or 39 gigahertz they penetrate
 
02:00:55.109 --> 02:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
a millimeter into the body so they don't
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
go beyond the depth of the skin that's
 
02:01:00.589 --> 02:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
it so your only exposure potential is to
 
02:01:03.470 --> 02:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
your eyes or to the skin now as you get
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
lower in frequencies as far as the human
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
body is concerned resonant frequency is
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
about 70 megahertz which is basically
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
close to FM radio that would be that
 
02:01:16.589 --> 02:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
would be a radio signal that's a long
 
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
enough wavelink that is absorbed very
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
efficiently into the body so usually the
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
frequencies like a Wi-Fi network that's
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
about a centimeter into the body not
 
02:01:30.069 --> 02:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
very far so even then you're not getting
 
02:01:31.830 --> 02:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
into Target organs or something of
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
thanks okay seeing no further questions
 
02:01:42.030 --> 02:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for being here and
 
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
offering your testimony and call the
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
last person who wants to speak on this
 
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
issue and that's ranne Chester of
 
02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:50.229 align:start position:0%
issue and that's ranne Chester of
Bedford

02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
Bedford
 
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:51.840 align:start position:0%
welcome to
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
SD thank you committee chair thank you
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
committee members um I was here uh prior
 
02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee being established in
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
2020 so I may be able to answer some of
 
02:02:08.629 --> 02:02:08.639 align:start position:0%
the questions that folks have you won't
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
see a lot of people coming to testify
 
02:02:14.589 --> 02:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
about this right now because they have
 
02:02:17.109 --> 02:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
saved their families and that's why
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
they're not here they have decided that
 
02:02:23.069 --> 02:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
it's more important to just get away
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
from what they believe is harming their
 
02:02:28.990 --> 02:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
their families and their children um I
 
02:02:31.069 --> 02:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
would encourage all of you folks to
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
listen to the heartwrenching testimony
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
that was that created that
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
commission it was
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching um I've heard a lot back
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
then and I heard some today it's cost-
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
prohibitive it's um they want easier
 
02:02:53.069 --> 02:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
faster access but at what cost that's
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
the one thing that all these PE
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
proponents that are pro um increasing
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
radio waves and uh radio frequencies
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's what they fail to tell us they
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
say this will give you quick easy
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
access at the cost of potentially your
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
health they never mention that and
 
02:03:18.669 --> 02:03:18.679 align:start position:0%
that's not okay we have spent a lot of
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
time time on this commission and there
 
02:03:23.950 --> 02:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
were a number of good things that came
 
02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
out of that commission and nothing was
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
done with it and we spent a lot of money
 
02:03:29.990 --> 02:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
on that commission too by the way um
 
02:03:31.390 --> 02:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
because we did a lot of
 
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:33.310 align:start position:0%
because we did a lot of
researches

02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
researches
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
um in the 60s it was the anti nausea
 
02:03:39.629 --> 02:03:39.639 align:start position:0%
medicine it was safe and effective
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
everyone believed it look at what we did
 
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
to our children DDT
 
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
Roundup aluminum and talcum powder the
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
pfas from St Kain took almost n years to
 
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
prove that they had been DET destroying
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
people what if we're right what if all
 
02:04:07.549 --> 02:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
these crazy conspiracist conspiracy
 
02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
theorists about they know their family
 
02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
they know when they moved into these
 
02:04:15.350 --> 02:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
facil these areas that they started
 
02:04:19.149 --> 02:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
having problems that's what they know
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
what if they're right is the state of
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire willing to say you're not
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
going to be able to say we didn't know
 
02:04:31.390 --> 02:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
you the state of New Hampshire will be
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
liable for all the damage that is being
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
done to our
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
citizens if we move forward um they
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about the commission
 
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
report and I just want to speak to the
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
comments on uh it was not equally
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
balanced if you look at that report um
 
02:04:51.350 --> 02:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
it was very very equally balanced um the
 
02:04:54.189 --> 02:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
problem is is that everybody in that
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
report other than the people on that
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
commission that were benefiting from the
 
02:05:05.109 --> 02:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
technology was against the technology
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean it's not balanced that
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
means that there are a lot more people
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.639 --> 02:05:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
problems

02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
problems
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh I look
 
02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
at right now what's going on in our
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
country there's a lack of trust there's
 
02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
a lack of trust for the science there's
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
a lack of trust for our government
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of a trust for our
 
02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
scientists because everybody has a price
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
and when I hear when I've read some of
 
02:05:36.669 --> 02:05:36.679 align:start position:0%
these um settlement
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
agreements the Johnson and Johnson
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement they
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
knew the risk of putting aluminum into
 
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
our bodies they took it anyways because
 
02:05:50.549 --> 02:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
it it was a cost risk
 
02:05:54.109 --> 02:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
benefit that should not be
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay that should not be okay I've heard
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
people speak to hear about um the
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
practicality shouldn't the practicality
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
of Life be more important than the cost
 
02:06:08.679 --> 02:06:09.910 align:start position:0%
of Life be more important than the cost
benefit

02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
analysis shouldn't it be more important
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
and more importantly this bill is not
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
eliminating 5G it is not a li it is not
 
02:06:24.390 --> 02:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
trying to destroy all our technology it
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
is merely a bill to say let's start
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
being proactive for a change the state
 
02:06:34.030 --> 02:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire needs to be proactive
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
instead of just jumping on the bandwagon
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
and saying okay now we have another
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
hundred million lawsuit settlement that
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
we have to try and pay let's be
 
02:06:46.589 --> 02:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
proactive and let's start reporting a
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
$500 um EMF or
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
RF recorder is not prohibitive to a
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
building inspector it is not building
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
inspectors make a lot of money off of
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
their profession and actually it's a
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
huge and increasing need if anything it
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
would benefit our our communities
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
because we would be able to encourage
 
02:07:14.470 --> 02:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
more building inspectors to come to go
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
into that profession because they truly
 
02:07:18.629 --> 02:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
feel like they're doing something we are
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
already do it with black mold we all
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
already do it with so many
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
things I was personally affected by St
 
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
Copan and PF the PFS p psfs p whatever
 
02:07:37.589 --> 02:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
um the bottom line is is that we started
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
screaming almost nine years before the
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
final settlement says oh yeah we were
 
02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:47.719 align:start position:0%
doing that they they St Cobain had done
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
it everywhere where they'd been and
 
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
still it was allowed to happen to our
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
communities that's not
 
02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
okay so I want all of you to really
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
consider as you're thinking about this
 
02:08:06.910 --> 02:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
bill the importance of what's what's
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
more important the lives of our New
 
02:08:12.149 --> 02:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens or the pockets of our
 
02:08:13.950 --> 02:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
people who are benefiting from this kind
 
02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:14.790 align:start position:0%
people who are benefiting from this kind
of

02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
resource thank you and I'm willing to
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
take any questions well thank you we
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate you coming down to give us
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
for I see none so thank you very much
 
02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
and we have no further pink cards no
 
02:08:35.790 --> 02:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh I haven't seen any further pink cards
 
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
are there pink cards out there that I
 
02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.830 align:start position:0%
are there pink cards out there that I
should

02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
see didn't get to
 
02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:51.870 align:start position:0%
see didn't get to
you

02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:53.950 --> 02:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
so apparently we do have another person
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
who would like to speak to us Alexandra
 
02:09:00.669 --> 02:09:00.679 align:start position:0%

02:09:04.950 --> 02:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
um please uh keep your remarks brief and
 
02:09:07.149 --> 02:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
try not to repeat any testimony we've
 
02:09:14.549 --> 02:09:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:14.559 --> 02:09:17.069 align:start position:0%
 
much

02:09:17.069 --> 02:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay all right right um thank you all
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
for giving me this opportunity to speak
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Alexander manella I'm from we
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm here in support of
 
02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.149 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm here in support of
HB

02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
HB
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
1487 I'm not here to prove that that the
 
02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
technology is harmful or dangerous I
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
believe this is um the hazards are
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
already established and I think the
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
Telecom corporations know this because
 
02:09:45.629 --> 02:09:45.639 align:start position:0%
they take measures to protect their
 
02:09:48.910 --> 02:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
workers from this technology
 
02:09:51.270 --> 02:09:51.280 align:start position:0%
right um they done certain personal
 
02:09:53.470 --> 02:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
protective equipment um when they do
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance on on it um there are
 
02:09:59.430 --> 02:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
warning signs around a lot of this
 
02:10:02.189 --> 02:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
equipment um when they do upgrades or
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance they shut the equipment down
 
02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
before they send human beings up there
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
to to work on it so it's not I can't
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
tell you exactly how Hazard this
 
02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
hazardous this technology is but there
 
02:10:16.709 --> 02:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
is some risk that I think we should all
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
consider so I'm not going to repeat
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
anything I'm just going to focus on why
 
02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:23.559 align:start position:0%
um I support this bill what I like about
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
it and then I'm going to speak to the
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
exhibit that I submitted so first of all
 
02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amendments to RSA 12
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
kilo um the things I like about
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
this um it it promotes transparency and
 
02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
that's really my main thing just being
 
02:10:41.830 --> 02:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
transparent right before you release
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
this safe and effective technology tell
 
02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
me why it's so safe and effective right
 
02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
be transparent with us that's that's my
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
my only um ask here so some of the
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations were to provide an
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
update an upto-date map of exposure
 
02:10:57.910 --> 02:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
levels locations of where this
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
technology has been deployed right so we
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
can see that to the public can see it
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
and it's readily available to us so I
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
like that I also like the the
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation to improve and
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
standardize signage for this technology
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
so for example I spent a lot of time in
 
02:11:17.109 --> 02:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I see these 5G mini
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
Towers going up all around their eye
 
02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
level with bedroom windows they're right
 
02:11:22.149 --> 02:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
outside of
 
02:11:25.109 --> 02:11:25.119 align:start position:0%
residences okay if it's safe it's safe
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I see little warning signs on them
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
and they're they're usually high up on
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
the utility pole small text not easily
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
legible kind of hard to see I think the
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
signage should be clear and apparent it
 
02:11:39.790 --> 02:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
should be bright yellow large legible
 
02:11:41.709 --> 02:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
and maybe even put it in braille right
 
02:11:43.390 --> 02:11:43.400 align:start position:0%
there's some risk here that the public
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be aware of um so I like that
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
again for transparency the next thing I
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
like about this bill is taking
 
02:11:52.990 --> 02:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
measurements and collecting data okay if
 
02:11:55.950 --> 02:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
it's safe let's let's just show show us
 
02:11:57.069 --> 02:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
that it's safe right there's a lot of
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
people that are concerned about it um so
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
take some measurements put the data out
 
02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
there and then let the public decide um
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
help you know let us make informed
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
decisions as to whether or not we want
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be um around this so I I don't I
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
can't tell you what the effects are on
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
the human body of cellular radiation or
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
um you know RF technology I can't give
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
you you know what exactly happens but
 
02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
let's measure it let's find out um and
 
02:12:32.270 --> 02:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe um you know having really fast
 
02:12:35.310 --> 02:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
wireless internet um outweighs the you
 
02:12:38.149 --> 02:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
know the risks to human health right so
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
but put that out there um I'll move on
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
so section four the recommendations for
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
wireless carriers I see cellular panels
 
02:12:48.510 --> 02:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
popping up like on the crazy iest things
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere there's panels on Office
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
Buildings and schools on uh it's it's
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
everywhere and then you have these 5G
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
mini Towers popping up in residential
 
02:12:58.790 --> 02:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
areas I think we need to put some
 
02:13:00.990 --> 02:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
limitations on where we put this stuff
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
um there was a recommendation for a 500
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
meter setback um in front of residences
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and schools so I think um
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
creating some limitations for Telecom
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
corporations to to adhere to would be U
 
02:13:16.830 --> 02:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
beneficial as well so those are the
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
reasons I support the bill um I think
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
these recommendations most of them are
 
02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
they're reasonable they are easily
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
enforcable and I I don't think a lot of
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
them are cost prohibitive either I think
 
02:13:30.149 --> 02:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
we kind of overthink that a lot and then
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's things we can do to kind of
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
enforce these things easily um and I
 
02:13:38.830 --> 02:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
know nothing is free but um I think it's
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
more important like the the cost of this
 
02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
is less important than
 
02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
um um giving corporations free reign
 
02:13:50.830 --> 02:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
right and and it's more important that
 
02:13:52.549 --> 02:13:52.559 align:start position:0%
we force organizations to be forthcoming
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
with information sorry for stumbling
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
there um and then lastly I just want to
 
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
refer you all to the exhibit that I
 
02:14:02.589 --> 02:14:02.599 align:start position:0%
passed around all right so I submitted
 
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
this just to kind of show you what I
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
think the attitude is of some of the
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
Telecom corporations that roll out this
 
02:14:11.549 --> 02:14:11.559 align:start position:0%
technology um it it seems to go
 
02:14:13.229 --> 02:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
unchecked so what you're looking at here
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's a giant cell tower in Bedford New
 
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's not easily
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
recognizable usually because it's you
 
02:14:21.149 --> 02:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
know in the summer and the spring it's
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
covered by trees and stuff but you know
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
in the winter you could see it pretty
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
clearly and it's located right by
 
02:14:30.549 --> 02:14:30.559 align:start position:0%
Ridgewood nursing home and a 62 plus um
 
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
disabled Community like right in the
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
corner in the parking lot and um I I
 
02:14:37.709 --> 02:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
don't know I just I think that's a
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
really peculiar place to put one of
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
these things and I wonder like you know
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
would any of you um want to live by this
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
or have it in your backyard or
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
um have your family near this um but you
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
know someone out there thought oh this
 
02:14:55.229 --> 02:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
is like the perfect spot for one of
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
these antennas you have elderly people
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
here and um you know a nursing home here
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
these people are on their way out anyway
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
just put it here no one will ever notice
 
02:15:05.709 --> 02:15:05.719 align:start position:0%
but I noticed it
 
02:15:05.719 --> 02:15:07.669 align:start position:0%
but I noticed it
um

02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
so um that's that's mostly what I have
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
here um I understand cellular technology
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
is advancing I use a cell phone um I I
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
just think we need to have a little more
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
transparency on on this technology
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm asking for here not
 
02:15:27.189 --> 02:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
Banning 5G I it's not ruining my life in
 
02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
any way I just like the information to
 
02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
be visible so we can make informed
 
02:15:33.709 --> 02:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
decisions I'll leave it at that thank
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you we appreciate your
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Ms would like
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
to ask you a question thank you Mr chair
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
02:15:47.350 --> 02:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the things that I
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
thought I heard heard you advocate for
 
02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
was signage explaining to people what
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
the the risks are um is there is there a
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
is there a
 
02:16:03.470 --> 02:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
definitive study that you know you can
 
02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
reference that would be referenced on
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
that signage to let people know that
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
there is a risk I personally don't have
 
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
one but there's existing signage up
 
02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
there now right so there must be some
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
risk if the Telecom comp compes are
 
02:16:19.950 --> 02:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
putting signs up there there's some
 
02:16:22.189 --> 02:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
study out there I don't have I'm not an
 
02:16:24.549 --> 02:16:24.559 align:start position:0%
expert there but you know clearly
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
hazard representative parshall has a
 
02:16:41.309 --> 02:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you chair and thank
 
02:16:44.629 --> 02:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um you mentioned
 
02:16:46.110 --> 02:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
if you were asking if people would like
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
to live near these cell to towers are
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
you aware of the decrease in property
 
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
values when these towers are placed near
 
02:16:57.150 --> 02:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
residential areas yes do you have any
 
02:17:00.389 --> 02:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
figures numbers on that I do not okay
 
02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:03.559 align:start position:0%
would be surprised to hear they were 7.4
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:13.150 --> 02:17:13.160 align:start position:0%
all okay seeing no further questions I
 
02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for thank you uh
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
talking to us here this morning and
 
02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
since I have no more pink cards I'm
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to bring to a close the public
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
1487 can uh I have filled out pardon I
 
02:17:31.389 --> 02:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
just say one thing take a minute okay
 
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
well if if you fill out a pink card and
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
don't give it to me then I can't
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
possibly know that you want to
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
speak so I've already closed the public
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm sorry we're going to have to
 
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe I Can Read just one
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
second I just want to remind everybody
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
you're made out of 70% water and water
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
is imprinted through radio waves the
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
bees they feel it more than we do and
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
these are very important factors of
 
02:18:01.629 --> 02:18:01.639 align:start position:0%
what's going on here microwave works by
 
02:18:04.389 --> 02:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
heating up the water vibrating the
 
02:18:06.509 --> 02:18:06.519 align:start position:0%
molecules we're all dealing with way
 
02:18:08.629 --> 02:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
more anxiety than we have over the last
 
02:18:08.639 --> 02:18:09.509 align:start position:0%
more anxiety than we have over the last
20

02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
20
 
02:18:12.070 --> 02:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
years this is a big deal everybody think
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%

02:18:21.389 --> 02:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
us please hand in your print card first
 
02:18:25.629 --> 02:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate that okay now we're done and
 
02:18:28.389 --> 02:18:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh so we're going to take a lunch break
 
02:18:29.469 --> 02:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to come back at
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
1:30 for a full committee work session
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
and later this afternoon we're going to
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
have an exec session and I want to alert
 
02:18:38.589 --> 02:18:38.599 align:start position:0%
the members of the
 
02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee that the speaker and the clerk
 
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
are requesting that all committee
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
reports what we used to to call blurbs
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
be handed in to the chair before you
 
02:18:58.669 --> 02:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
leave at the end of the day so if you
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
think that you might be writing a
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
committee report either a major majority
 
02:19:04.910 --> 02:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
or Minority
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
Report think about how you can work on
 
02:19:10.429 --> 02:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
that maybe during your lunch break or at
 
02:19:12.389 --> 02:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
some other time so that you can get it
 
02:19:15.230 --> 02:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
to me before you leave the building this
 
02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
evening and you might want to confer
 
02:19:19.309 --> 02:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
with your caucus leader if you're not
 
02:19:20.709 --> 02:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
sure if you're going to be on the hook
 
02:19:23.629 --> 02:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
for writing said report any reports that
 
02:19:25.870 --> 02:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
I do not get before the close of
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
business um today will not be included
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
in the calendar and that's per the
 
02:19:34.950 --> 02:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
speaker and the house
 
02:19:37.709 --> 02:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
clerk so with that enjoy your lunch and
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.439 --> 03:34:15.429 align:start position:0%
 
1:30

03:34:15.429 --> 03:34:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:19.630 --> 03:34:19.640 align:start position:0%
work session on bills that we will
 
03:34:25.950 --> 03:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:25.960 --> 03:34:28.030 align:start position:0%
 
3:00

03:34:28.030 --> 03:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
3:00
 
03:34:31.750 --> 03:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
so we might as well take these in order
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
as they're listed in the scheduling
 
03:34:39.790 --> 03:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
notice the first bill listed there is
 
03:34:43.309 --> 03:34:43.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 16 97-
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
FN the original title was suspending New
 
03:34:48.429 --> 03:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's participation in emissions
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
reduction credit programs for a period
 
03:34:54.269 --> 03:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
of two years we all know from the public
 
03:34:57.110 --> 03:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
hearing that that was not the intent of
 
03:34:57.120 --> 03:34:58.790 align:start position:0%
hearing that that was not the intent of
the

03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:02.429 --> 03:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
sponsors and that what they really
 
03:35:05.229 --> 03:35:05.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was address some issues
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
raised by Forest carbon credit
 
03:35:09.600 --> 03:35:13.030 align:start position:0%
raised by Forest carbon credit
programs

03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:16.189 --> 03:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
so in response to that public hearing I
 
03:35:16.199 --> 03:35:18.229 align:start position:0%
so in response to that public hearing I
went

03:35:18.229 --> 03:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
went
 
03:35:21.670 --> 03:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
to well first we had some uh internal
 
03:35:23.710 --> 03:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
discussions and then I went to OS and
 
03:35:27.229 --> 03:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
requested an amendment and Os
 
03:35:30.309 --> 03:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
produced an amendment for
 
03:35:32.469 --> 03:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
us it
 
03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
is amendment number
 
03:35:40.110 --> 03:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
224-0318 and I passed it out yesterday
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
to every
 
03:35:43.389 --> 03:35:43.399 align:start position:0%
everyone and so I'm assuming that
 
03:35:46.030 --> 03:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
everyone has a copy of
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:53.150 --> 03:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
correct am
 
03:35:53.160 --> 03:35:55.189 align:start position:0%
correct am
again

03:35:55.189 --> 03:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:35:58.389 --> 03:35:58.399 align:start position:0%
2024 D
 
03:35:58.399 --> 03:36:06.950 align:start position:0%
2024 D
0310

03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
H so the name of the bill has been
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
changed to
 
03:36:14.110 --> 03:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
relative to enrollment of forest land in
 
03:36:14.120 --> 03:36:16.510 align:start position:0%
relative to enrollment of forest land in
carbon

03:36:16.510 --> 03:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
carbon
 
03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
programs and the amendment replaces all
 
03:36:24.309 --> 03:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill after the enacting
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
Clause with the text that you see on
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:37.110 --> 03:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
30 since uh we didn't receive this
 
03:36:39.469 --> 03:36:39.479 align:start position:0%
amendment until yesterday afternoon at
 
03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:47.189 --> 03:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
3:00 there was no way to really there
 
03:36:49.510 --> 03:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
was no time really to figure out whether
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
this did what we wanted it to do until
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
after we completed
 
03:37:01.110 --> 03:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:03.630 --> 03:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday after we did complete that
 
03:37:05.710 --> 03:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
work we looked at this amendment and
 
03:37:08.590 --> 03:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
discovered that it doesn't actually do
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:16.590 --> 03:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
so as a result of that after we continue
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
our discussion here in a few
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
minutes when we get to exec session I'm
 
03:37:23.950 --> 03:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
going to be calling I'm going to open
 
03:37:25.950 --> 03:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
the exec session because it is a
 
03:37:27.389 --> 03:37:27.399 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting but then I'm
 
03:37:29.309 --> 03:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
immediately going to call for a
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
recess now we're going
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
to have to move that exec session to
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
another date because we need an
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that actually works and is
 
03:37:41.880 --> 03:37:43.349 align:start position:0%
amendment that actually works and is
actually

03:37:43.349 --> 03:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
effective just doing an amendment that
 
03:37:49.150 --> 03:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything isn't
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
useful so we're going to spend another
 
03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
week and I've got uh some folks like
 
03:37:58.990 --> 03:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
Jason stock of the Timberland Owners
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
Association and some lobbyists like Dave
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
czy working on some new language that
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:38:09.510 --> 03:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
effective and attempt to address some of
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
the issues that this
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
bill has
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
raised so I'm I'm willing to have a
 
03:38:20.990 --> 03:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee discussion right now about the
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that's before us even though
 
03:38:25.710 --> 03:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
that will not be the final Amendment if
 
03:38:31.189 --> 03:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
on representative Harrington could you
 
03:38:37.269 --> 03:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
give us like a brief summary or outline
 
03:38:39.550 --> 03:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
of what this new Amendment to the
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
amendment's going to to do so we have
 
03:38:43.269 --> 03:38:43.279 align:start position:0%
some idea of what to expect because I
 
03:38:44.830 --> 03:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
mean if you say this there's there's a
 
03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
bunch of things in this amendment I
 
03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
clearly don't support so I'm wondering
 
03:38:50.670 --> 03:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
if they're still going to be
 
03:38:53.429 --> 03:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
there all right so the as the public
 
03:38:56.349 --> 03:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
hearing revealed there's three basic
 
03:38:56.359 --> 03:38:58.510 align:start position:0%
hearing revealed there's three basic
problems

03:38:58.510 --> 03:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
problems
 
03:39:01.150 --> 03:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
that the sponsors of the bill are trying
 
03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
to solve trying to resolve the first
 
03:39:07.389 --> 03:39:07.399 align:start position:0%
problem is loss of Timber tax
 
03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
revenue and section one of the amendment
 
03:39:14.429 --> 03:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you actually
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
addresses that issue by requiring the
 
03:39:19.710 --> 03:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
03:39:23.710 --> 03:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
to develop rules to implement RSA 79
 
03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:24.950 align:start position:0%
to develop rules to implement RSA 79
colon

03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
colon
 
03:39:28.870 --> 03:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
5 and that will be part of the new
 
03:39:32.590 --> 03:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
well where the problems arise are
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
the ru
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
making an establishment of a forest
 
03:39:46.510 --> 03:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
registry the language that's here
 
03:39:49.710 --> 03:39:49.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't really work from what I've been
 
03:39:53.309 --> 03:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
told and so we need some new language
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
that will
 
03:39:57.950 --> 03:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
work furthermore the very last section
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
of the amendment lines 27- 29 about
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
conservation easements I'm told
 
03:40:05.750 --> 03:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
easements I'm told that that language
 
03:40:08.429 --> 03:40:08.439 align:start position:0%
also is
 
03:40:10.590 --> 03:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
probably not going to work for a lot of
 
03:40:13.229 --> 03:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
people so we probably will delete that
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
section Al
 
03:40:17.590 --> 03:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
together so what we'll end up with is an
 
03:40:19.429 --> 03:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that has some new language
 
03:40:23.910 --> 03:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
about creating a forest lands registry
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
that contains information about carbon
 
03:40:26.160 --> 03:40:27.750 align:start position:0%
that contains information about carbon
credit

03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
credit
 
03:40:30.950 --> 03:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
programs what will it look like exactly
 
03:40:35.349 --> 03:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure at this point but
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
uh the goal will be to get this language
 
03:40:41.349 --> 03:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
out soon enough so that all of us will
 
03:40:45.070 --> 03:40:45.080 align:start position:0%
be able to study it and evaluate it for
 
03:40:48.510 --> 03:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
multiple days before we have our next
 
03:40:51.550 --> 03:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
work session and exec session on this
 
03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:54.150 align:start position:0%
work session and exec session on this
topic

03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
topic
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
because we feel and particularly house
 
03:40:59.550 --> 03:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
leadership feels that this is an
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
important subject that we need to get
 
03:41:06.389 --> 03:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
some some clear clarity about and so
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to do that before we
 
03:41:10.750 --> 03:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
03:41:12.319 --> 03:41:14.269 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
representative

03:41:14.269 --> 03:41:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:41:16.389 --> 03:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
Harrington well it answers my question
 
03:41:19.469 --> 03:41:19.479 align:start position:0%
but doesn't elay my concerns thank you
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
well this is a work station and there
 
03:41:23.550 --> 03:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
are people in the room who will be
 
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
working on an amendment Amendment
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
language if you want to share your
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:37.349 --> 03:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
helpful well I guess my major concern
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
was I'm trying to figure I haven't read
 
03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
this RSA 7 95 but I think it refers to
 
03:41:44.670 --> 03:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
the rather archaic old law that says if
 
03:41:47.070 --> 03:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
you don't cut down your Timber the towns
 
03:41:50.070 --> 03:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
can tax you for not cutting it uh that's
 
03:41:51.790 --> 03:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
a stupid law in my opinion shouldn't be
 
03:41:53.510 --> 03:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
on the books if you own the property you
 
03:41:55.149 --> 03:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to cut your Lumber down you
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to and you shouldn't be
 
03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
penalized for that by any stretch of
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
that and by putting in the bill to
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
develop new rules to do that I like I
 
03:42:06.670 --> 03:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
say real problem with that okay good
 
03:42:09.550 --> 03:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
that's good feedback representative ner
 
03:42:11.910 --> 03:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
um have do we have copies of the
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
amendment or notes on it yes they were
 
03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
passed out yesterday they were passed
 
03:42:19.630 --> 03:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
out yesterday are there any extra copies
 
03:42:19.640 --> 03:42:20.550 align:start position:0%
out yesterday are there any extra copies
you

03:42:20.550 --> 03:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:42:22.750 --> 03:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
take I don't know if there were extra
 
03:42:24.990 --> 03:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
copies Christie do you
 
03:42:28.269 --> 03:42:28.279 align:start position:0%
know oh they're gone okay no extra
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
copies apparently
 
03:42:34.110 --> 03:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
sorry any further discussion before we
 
03:42:37.630 --> 03:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank you um did
 
03:42:39.349 --> 03:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
you list all the areas that we were
 
03:42:40.590 --> 03:42:40.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about because there's
 
03:42:42.510 --> 03:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't been mentioned
 
03:42:44.269 --> 03:42:44.279 align:start position:0%
that at least I'm concerned about and
 
03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
that is the effect on the support for
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
the timber industry the Mills the people
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
who transport Lumber and if Timber isn't
 
03:42:55.550 --> 03:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
being cut then they are affected deeply
 
03:42:58.630 --> 03:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
as well and as we heard during testimony
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
that throws into question the survival
 
03:43:04.950 --> 03:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
of the Timber industry if the support
 
03:43:07.710 --> 03:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
for the timber industry is not
 
03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
viable thank you for remember
 
03:43:13.349 --> 03:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
remembering that I had U I had not
 
03:43:14.870 --> 03:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
forgotten it but I had forgotten to
 
03:43:14.880 --> 03:43:15.750 align:start position:0%
forgotten it but I had forgotten to
mention

03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
mention
 
03:43:15.760 --> 03:43:17.830 align:start position:0%
mention
it

03:43:17.830 --> 03:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
uh coming up with legislative language
 
03:43:22.670 --> 03:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
to solve that problem
 
03:43:25.710 --> 03:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
is probably outside the scope of what we
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
can do in the short term that sounds
 
03:43:32.429 --> 03:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
like a a long-term problem that's going
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
to take some significant work to come up
 
03:43:37.990 --> 03:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
with a solution if there even is a
 
03:43:41.309 --> 03:43:41.319 align:start position:0%
solution because now you're talking
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
about the mar the market private markets
 
03:43:48.910 --> 03:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
and uh whether government's going to try
 
03:43:51.389 --> 03:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
to intervene in those markets that's a
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
tricky tricky subject as you well know
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
so the amendment may not be able to
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
address that issue but if we can address
 
03:44:00.550 --> 03:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
issues maybe we can get somewhere and
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
make some you know some significant
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
progress anybody
 
03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:12.870 align:start position:0%
progress anybody
else

03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
all right let's move on then from
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:27.229 --> 03:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
1700 so
 
03:44:27.239 --> 03:44:28.750 align:start position:0%
1700 so
representative

03:44:28.750 --> 03:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:44:30.990 --> 03:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
Thomas Vice chair
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
Thomas has an amendment
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:42.189 --> 03:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:42.199 --> 03:44:43.349 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:44:43.349 --> 03:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:44:50.670 --> 03:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
it repeals RSA 12- F which is a
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization statute that was placed
 
03:44:57.630 --> 03:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
into the rsas back in
 
03:45:00.110 --> 03:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
1985 nobody seems to know whether it's
 
03:45:03.189 --> 03:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
ever been used but allows weather
 
03:45:08.070 --> 03:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh represent or vice chair Thomas
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
decided that it would be appropriate to
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
repeal that legislation since it's not
 
03:45:19.870 --> 03:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
being used
 
03:45:23.149 --> 03:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
anyway and so that would be the our plan
 
03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:25.479 align:start position:0%
going forward you want to pass that out
 
03:45:28.110 --> 03:45:28.120 align:start position:0%
dou or did you already do that I've
 
03:45:29.910 --> 03:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
already passed it
 
03:45:33.189 --> 03:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
around okay I haven't seen a copy but I
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
think extras
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
here thank you thank
 
03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:40.670 align:start position:0%
here thank you thank
you

03:45:40.670 --> 03:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:45:42.910 --> 03:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
so Doug do you want Vice chair Thomas
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
please yes well in the interest of
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
keeping it simple we looked at you know
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
the overall Bill and a lot of that bill
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
was unworkable or or areas that were
 
03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
sort of uh hard to substantiate uh
 
03:46:08.389 --> 03:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
certainly to put into effect but the one
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
area that seemed to be something that
 
03:46:14.510 --> 03:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
had some good good purpose was that U
 
03:46:17.189 --> 03:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
ancient RSA that no one seems to
 
03:46:19.189 --> 03:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
remember ever having it been enacted and
 
03:46:20.950 --> 03:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
certainly it's not something that we
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
were particularly wanted to do at this
 
03:46:25.710 --> 03:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
time so at the very least uh to get this
 
03:46:29.469 --> 03:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
thing rolling uh we felt that um having
 
03:46:32.309 --> 03:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
a simple deletion of that RSA was at
 
03:46:34.630 --> 03:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
least one step in in the direction of
 
03:46:36.910 --> 03:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
something we could get done this year so
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
that's why we did
 
03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:40.189 align:start position:0%
that's why we did
it

03:46:40.189 --> 03:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:46:43.990 --> 03:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
comments representative Corman thank you
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
um so I'm actually looking at the
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
RSA and the RSA says any department or
 
03:46:50.510 --> 03:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
agency of the state may with the
 
03:46:52.149 --> 03:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
approval of the governor and Council and
 
03:46:54.070 --> 03:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
within the limits of appropriated funds
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
or by means of gifts Etc engage in and
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
undertake experimentation in the
 
03:47:00.149 --> 03:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
techniques and methods for weather
 
03:47:02.189 --> 03:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
modification and may cooperate therein
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
with the federal government with
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
authorized agencies of other states and
 
03:47:07.389 --> 03:47:07.399 align:start position:0%
with interested persons and
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
organizations and then it goes on to
 
03:47:12.510 --> 03:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
list some guard rails some conditions so
 
03:47:16.269 --> 03:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is if we repeal this
 
03:47:19.910 --> 03:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're repealing any guard rails that are
 
03:47:23.349 --> 03:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
in place and I don't know of any
 
03:47:26.070 --> 03:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
language anywhere that says that uh
 
03:47:30.429 --> 03:47:30.439 align:start position:0%
whether modification may not happen so
 
03:47:31.990 --> 03:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
if there isn't language anywhere that
 
03:47:33.630 --> 03:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
says it may not happen it maybe I'm
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
wrong maybe there is some somewhere but
 
03:47:37.030 --> 03:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
if there isn't language that says it may
 
03:47:39.670 --> 03:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
not happen seems like then maybe it may
 
03:47:41.070 --> 03:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
happen and we're removing the guard
 
03:47:42.630 --> 03:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
rails and I'm just a little concerned
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
about that I certainly agree with the
 
03:47:47.309 --> 03:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
the spirit of trying to fix this but I'm
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
just a little concerned about throwing
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
out the baby with the bath
 
03:47:57.269 --> 03:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
water in your reading of the RSA is it
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
your sense that this applies to
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
governmental weather
 
03:48:05.149 --> 03:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
modification yes I mean it just says any
 
03:48:07.269 --> 03:48:07.279 align:start position:0%
department or agency of the state it
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anything about anybody else
 
03:48:13.830 --> 03:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
so if we remove the Authority for the
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
state to engage in weather
 
03:48:19.149 --> 03:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
modification I think that would make a
 
03:48:22.670 --> 03:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:25.149 --> 03:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
happy I mean my comment was I don't know
 
03:48:26.990 --> 03:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
if if we have anywhere that says the
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
state may
 
03:48:31.830 --> 03:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
not well if we're removing the Authority
 
03:48:35.229 --> 03:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
for the state to do it then how would
 
03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
the state do it if it was
 
03:48:38.399 --> 03:48:40.030 align:start position:0%
the state do it if it was
gone

03:48:40.030 --> 03:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
gone
 
03:48:41.790 --> 03:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
I see your your point you're trying to
 
03:48:43.950 --> 03:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
say should we forbid the state from
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
doing this but that's a different
 
03:48:48.429 --> 03:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
question than just repealing
 
03:48:52.670 --> 03:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
this particular RSA representative
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
Harrington um one of the things I'd be
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
curious about this I don't know if
 
03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
anybody knows this uh RSA was written
 
03:49:01.510 --> 03:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
some time ago has any department or
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
agency ever applied to the executive
 
03:49:05.389 --> 03:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
Council for approval for weather
 
03:49:08.149 --> 03:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
modification because that may be a good
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
way of getting a handle on this if it's
 
03:49:12.950 --> 03:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
never been used then the maybe it just
 
03:49:16.189 --> 03:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
becomes a useless law um that would be
 
03:49:17.710 --> 03:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
something we could look at I do have to
 
03:49:19.189 --> 03:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative saying
 
03:49:21.510 --> 03:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
that if you just repeal it then does it
 
03:49:23.670 --> 03:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
mean well then any Department can do
 
03:49:24.910 --> 03:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
whatever they want because there's no
 
03:49:27.469 --> 03:49:27.479 align:start position:0%
prohibition and that's sort of a long
 
03:49:30.389 --> 03:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
fuzzy uh legal road to go down because
 
03:49:31.670 --> 03:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
you have to look exactly what their
 
03:49:33.950 --> 03:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
duties are and so forth that I probably
 
03:49:35.990 --> 03:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
want to avoid but I think first could we
 
03:49:38.590 --> 03:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
find out has any department or agency
 
03:49:40.110 --> 03:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
ever apply to the the executive Council
 
03:49:42.309 --> 03:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
for approval to do weather modifications
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a record of it somewhere
 
03:49:46.469 --> 03:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
done representative nter thank you
 
03:49:52.229 --> 03:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
during the hearing um some people
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
testified about um there being aluminum
 
03:49:58.110 --> 03:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
being sprayed and um I don't know what
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
that if it's really being sprayed or not
 
03:50:01.590 --> 03:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
but what I do know and I brought this in
 
03:50:03.710 --> 03:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
for informational purposes is that
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
aluminum is in vaccines and vaccines
 
03:50:09.309 --> 03:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
aluminum has been implicated as a Cause
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
of brain damage suspected factor in
 
03:50:13.469 --> 03:50:13.479 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease dementia seizures
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
and Comas allergic reactions can occur
 
03:50:18.910 --> 03:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
on skin there's also a note that when
 
03:50:20.630 --> 03:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
babies are hours or days old is
 
03:50:21.830 --> 03:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
impossible to know if they have an
 
03:50:24.189 --> 03:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
allergy so I just wanted to to put that
 
03:50:26.670 --> 03:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
out there um that
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
aluminum it's it's everywhere including
 
03:50:30.000 --> 03:50:31.389 align:start position:0%
aluminum it's it's everywhere including
the

03:50:31.389 --> 03:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:34.750 --> 03:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
shots okay thank you represent Vice
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
chair Thomas yes thank you Mr chair
 
03:50:38.590 --> 03:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
getting back to uh representative
 
03:50:41.670 --> 03:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington's um comments I believe if I
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
recall correctly we heard during
 
03:50:45.630 --> 03:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that at least to the best of
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
their recollection no one there at the
 
03:50:51.189 --> 03:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
time and and no state agency could ever
 
03:50:54.429 --> 03:50:54.439 align:start position:0%
recall this RSA being enacted or to be
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
used although we didn't do an extensive
 
03:50:59.070 --> 03:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
investigation Research into it uh the
 
03:51:00.309 --> 03:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
people that were here at the time said
 
03:51:01.950 --> 03:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
that they were unaware of it ever being
 
03:51:06.550 --> 03:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:11.469 --> 03:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
this representative Thomas yes thank you
 
03:51:14.349 --> 03:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm hearing that it's an older
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
law um and that it it may not be
 
03:51:20.710 --> 03:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
effective but I'm wondering why it was
 
03:51:22.710 --> 03:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
put in place in the first place does
 
03:51:24.830 --> 03:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
anybody have any of that history why did
 
03:51:28.349 --> 03:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
law I have no idea I don't recall if we
 
03:51:33.389 --> 03:51:33.399 align:start position:0%
asked that question during the public
 
03:51:35.910 --> 03:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
hearing but representative nter do you
 
03:51:38.030 --> 03:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
know the answer no but I'm wondering if
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
it was a rule put in place because um
 
03:51:44.830 --> 03:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
going just to compare going back um I
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
don't know to 2011 there was um we
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
repealed a bill uh we repealed a law
 
03:51:53.229 --> 03:51:53.239 align:start position:0%
that was never voted on by the
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
legislature it was put in place by the
 
03:51:57.309 --> 03:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
department of fishing game as a rule and
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
that happens a
 
03:52:01.990 --> 03:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
lot rules are different from from state
 
03:52:06.189 --> 03:52:06.199 align:start position:0%
law okay yeah they're completely
 
03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
different yes um Chris
 
03:52:12.750 --> 03:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
could you see if you could do some
 
03:52:15.990 --> 03:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
research to find out why that law was
 
03:52:20.189 --> 03:52:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.199 --> 03:52:25.670 align:start position:0%
 
12f

03:52:25.670 --> 03:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.910 --> 03:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay we'll see what you can find out for
 
03:52:31.469 --> 03:52:31.479 align:start position:0%
now and if you find anything let us know
 
03:52:34.990 --> 03:52:35.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't then we'll we have options
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is a proposed amendment we don't
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
have to adopt this amendment
 
03:52:41.790 --> 03:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
if we don't adopt this amendment then
 
03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have to make another judgment
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
about what to do with this bill
 
03:52:45.359 --> 03:52:47.229 align:start position:0%
about what to do with this bill
representative

03:52:47.229 --> 03:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:52:51.630 --> 03:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
PL thank you chair uh in the previous uh
 
03:52:54.750 --> 03:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
testimony there was no mention they did
 
03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
re they claim they did research on this
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
and even there's no mention of the
 
03:53:01.790 --> 03:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
federal authorities who's supposed to
 
03:53:05.510 --> 03:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
report to the state agency have making
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
any um notice of spraying so whatever so
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
I think it has been looked into um I'm
 
03:53:16.990 --> 03:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
sure if there was it would have been
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:25.870 --> 03:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
testimony so apparently this uh statute
 
03:53:29.950 --> 03:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
2021 modified but I don't know what the
 
03:53:32.640 --> 03:53:37.950 align:start position:0%
2021 modified but I don't know what the
modification

03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
was

03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.389 --> 03:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
I have that in my okay so apparently
 
03:53:52.110 --> 03:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
this was modified by a bill filed by
 
03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative Judy Aaron in 2020 or
 
03:54:00.070 --> 03:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
2021 yes and it was there was a uh an
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
article in the newspaper that I printed
 
03:54:03.510 --> 03:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
which was in my book and I probably
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
can't put my hands on it immediately but
 
03:54:07.429 --> 03:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
it was basically the bill was passed to
 
03:54:09.269 --> 03:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that there would be notice
 
03:54:17.110 --> 03:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.670 --> 03:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
um so there is language in here about
 
03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
disclosing to the public the chemical
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
compounds and Technologies to be used in
 
03:54:25.229 --> 03:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
proposed weather
 
03:54:25.239 --> 03:54:31.870 align:start position:0%
proposed weather
modification

03:54:31.870 --> 03:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
Etc okay any further comments uh
 
03:54:35.279 --> 03:54:36.950 align:start position:0%
Etc okay any further comments uh
representative

03:54:36.950 --> 03:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:54:40.110 --> 03:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
Thomas um and I I don't see that
 
03:54:44.429 --> 03:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
modified bill from 2021 but um
 
03:54:49.269 --> 03:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
who gives the the uh notification of of
 
03:54:52.349 --> 03:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
something and has notification ever been
 
03:54:59.389 --> 03:54:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:11.229 align:start position:0%
 
statute

03:55:11.229 --> 03:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:13.149 --> 03:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm going to assume it's Dees
 
03:55:15.510 --> 03:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
because they've got an air division the
 
03:55:17.149 --> 03:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
department or agency of the state
 
03:55:19.429 --> 03:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
participating in such engagement or
 
03:55:22.149 --> 03:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
experimentation shall do the following
 
03:55:23.830 --> 03:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
place a public notice in at least four
 
03:55:26.389 --> 03:55:26.399 align:start position:0%
newspapers within the state and on the
 
03:55:28.630 --> 03:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
departmental internet website informing
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
the public of the date and type of the
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
proposed weather modification program or
 
03:55:36.910 --> 03:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
experimentation events within the state
 
03:55:39.309 --> 03:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
do that answer your question well
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
the follow-up was or not the followup
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
but the other part of my question was
 
03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
has that ever been
 
03:55:49.469 --> 03:55:49.479 align:start position:0%
done has Dees ever or or the agency ever
 
03:55:49.479 --> 03:55:50.269 align:start position:0%
done has Dees ever or or the agency ever
put

03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
put
 
03:55:52.389 --> 03:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
for have have they gone through this
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism or is it just they're in case
 
03:55:58.269 --> 03:55:58.279 align:start position:0%
someday since it is an an existing state
 
03:56:00.830 --> 03:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
law I would surmise that if any
 
03:56:03.269 --> 03:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
department has engaged in this activity
 
03:56:05.149 --> 03:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
they would have followed the law and
 
03:56:08.110 --> 03:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
notified the public do I know of any
 
03:56:11.229 --> 03:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
instance where that's happened I do
 
03:56:16.030 --> 03:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
not yep representative PL uh thank you
 
03:56:16.040 --> 03:56:17.990 align:start position:0%
not yep representative PL uh thank you

chair
 
03:56:20.469 --> 03:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
um maybe to answer this question I just
 
03:56:21.870 --> 03:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
want to bring the chair's attention
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's another amendment in for
 
03:56:27.990 --> 03:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
1700 and the sponsor representative
 
03:56:31.149 --> 03:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
Penza is in the audience maybe she if
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to ask she could
 
03:56:35.630 --> 03:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
have have done research or know of
 
03:56:37.630 --> 03:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
research done on that just to bring it
 
03:56:39.830 --> 03:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
to your attention thank you okay thank
 
03:56:43.870 --> 03:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
you representative muns Mr chair I I I
 
03:56:46.389 --> 03:56:46.399 align:start position:0%
just did a little search and there was a
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
bill passed in 2021 HB
 
03:56:54.750 --> 03:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
128 which added section two to the RSA
 
03:56:58.630 --> 03:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
as we see it now previous to um that
 
03:57:00.510 --> 03:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill passing the only things on the
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
books the only thing on the books was
 
03:57:02.640 --> 03:57:04.830 align:start position:0%
books the only thing on the books was
section

03:57:04.830 --> 03:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:57:11.550 --> 03:57:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:14.070 --> 03:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
one so section two is all about
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
disclosure and public input that bill
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
added all the disclosure requirements
 
03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for looking that up
 
03:57:23.670 --> 03:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that representative
 
03:57:26.590 --> 03:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah Mr chair just to answer the
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
question about the dees and and their
 
03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge about these programs when when
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
we had the dees uh Comm I believe he was
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the air Resources
 
03:57:36.990 --> 03:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
Division he was in here testifying I
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
asked him do you have you known of any
 
03:57:41.469 --> 03:57:41.479 align:start position:0%
such programs of experimentation taking
 
03:57:43.149 --> 03:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
place at the federal level and he said
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
no not that his not so I mean I'm
 
03:57:47.550 --> 03:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
assuming that that would also cover any
 
03:57:48.910 --> 03:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
cooperating sort of weather
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
experimentation that was done by any
 
03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
Department his
 
03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
department so just I wanted to offer
 
03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
that so representative Corman were was
 
03:58:02.910 --> 03:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
section two of the statute the guard
 
03:58:06.309 --> 03:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
rails that you spoke of earlier okay yes
 
03:58:06.319 --> 03:58:07.510 align:start position:0%
rails that you spoke of earlier okay yes
further

03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:10.670 align:start position:0%
further
discussion

03:58:10.670 --> 03:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:12.110 --> 03:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
so how do you guys want to proceed do
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
you want to consider this amendment at
 
03:58:17.070 --> 03:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
an executive session or take some other
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
action on this
 
03:58:20.110 --> 03:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
bill any
 
03:58:23.149 --> 03:58:23.159 align:start position:0%
comment representative liwicki I'm in
 
03:58:25.469 --> 03:58:25.479 align:start position:0%
favor of uh adopting the
 
03:58:28.590 --> 03:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
amendment thank
 
03:58:31.110 --> 03:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
you anyone else have preferences
 
03:58:33.030 --> 03:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative parshall uh can we
 
03:58:34.349 --> 03:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
specify which amendment I assume we're
 
03:58:36.349 --> 03:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
talking about uh uh representative
 
03:58:38.309 --> 03:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
Thomas's uh Amendment but I just want to
 
03:58:40.229 --> 03:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's yeah it's 202
 
03:58:47.790 --> 03:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:51.790 --> 03:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
you any further representative Kaplan I
 
03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
I suppose I just want to Echo
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
representative corman's uh hesitance
 
03:58:59.229 --> 03:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
about just eliminating this uh section
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
12f colon one given that it it adds the
 
03:59:06.510 --> 03:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
guard rails of notification and uh
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
public input public it solicits public
 
03:59:10.750 --> 03:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
input regarding any proposed weather
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
modification program um which seems to
 
03:59:16.950 --> 03:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
me that that's sort of what the original
 
03:59:18.790 --> 03:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
sponsors of the bill intended in the
 
03:59:20.830 --> 03:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
first place is to have some sort of
 
03:59:23.830 --> 03:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
guard rails around any future weather
 
03:59:23.840 --> 03:59:25.429 align:start position:0%
guard rails around any future weather
modification

03:59:25.429 --> 03:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
modification
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
experimentation okay representative MC
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
Williams thank you shair v um this has
 
03:59:31.910 --> 03:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
been a really helpful conversation and
 
03:59:33.389 --> 03:59:33.399 align:start position:0%
I'm glad we're having a work session on
 
03:59:35.429 --> 03:59:35.439 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment I think that we
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
may be able to take a little bit of a
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
more uh moderated TCT instead of
 
03:59:42.990 --> 03:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
repealing this uh provision altogether
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
if we were to put a moratorium on this
 
03:59:46.550 --> 03:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
provision for a certain number of years
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
say two years to give some time to look
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
into this I think that it would be
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate seeing as we don't have any
 
03:59:54.070 --> 03:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
evidence that this is actually being
 
03:59:56.510 --> 03:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
used but there is evidence that as of
 
03:59:59.469 --> 03:59:59.479 align:start position:0%
2021 there was a second piece added to
 
04:00:01.870 --> 04:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
the RSA on the books to make sure that
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's disclosure so the section one is
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
really the portion I think we could put
 
04:00:08.429 --> 04:00:08.439 align:start position:0%
a a two-year hold on and just say we
 
04:00:10.870 --> 04:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
cannot for the next two years and then
 
04:00:12.670 --> 04:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
it would be repealed after that period
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
of time rather than completely repealing
 
04:00:16.710 --> 04:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
this out of whole cloth and removing an
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
RSA thank you interesting idea
 
04:00:20.080 --> 04:00:21.349 align:start position:0%
RSA thank you interesting idea
representative

04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:00:23.550 --> 04:00:23.560 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah you my I I share the
 
04:00:26.349 --> 04:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
concern it's been stated because uh we
 
04:00:28.149 --> 04:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if this has been used at all
 
04:00:29.710 --> 04:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it was put in and it was never
 
04:00:32.510 --> 04:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
used we don't know why someone opted in
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
2021 at least not the president as to
 
04:00:36.429 --> 04:00:36.439 align:start position:0%
why they thought it was necessary to put
 
04:00:38.469 --> 04:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
those additional disclosure things in
 
04:00:40.429 --> 04:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
there were was it being used and it
 
04:00:42.750 --> 04:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't being disclosed to the public th
 
04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
those are questions I think we need to
 
04:00:46.990 --> 04:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
answer because before we just repeal
 
04:00:48.990 --> 04:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
this we got to figure out if it's really
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
necessary to have some controls on that
 
04:00:53.790 --> 04:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
so I would opt that we wait a little bit
 
04:00:56.790 --> 04:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
on this I know it's a uh it's an FN bill
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's an early bill but I think
 
04:01:01.030 --> 04:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
we could wait another few days or till
 
04:01:03.750 --> 04:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
next week and find out has is there any
 
04:01:05.229 --> 04:01:05.239 align:start position:0%
record of the executive Council
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
approving a weather modification has any
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
Department ever had any record of
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
requesting it and why was the uh 2021
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
Bill written something must have
 
04:01:16.590 --> 04:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
prompted that not just someone going
 
04:01:18.750 --> 04:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
through the rsas and saying boy it'd be
 
04:01:20.030 --> 04:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
nice to have public disclosure on
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
weather modifications so I I just think
 
04:01:24.189 --> 04:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
we should give it a little bit more time
 
04:01:26.189 --> 04:01:26.199 align:start position:0%
before we make a decision whether to
 
04:01:30.990 --> 04:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:33.510 --> 04:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
is oh I don't think unfortunately that
 
04:01:36.429 --> 04:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
we have said time I think we have to
 
04:01:38.429 --> 04:01:38.439 align:start position:0%
make a decision today this is an early
 
04:01:40.590 --> 04:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
bill so we have to decide what we're
 
04:01:43.269 --> 04:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
going to do we could amend
 
04:01:46.830 --> 04:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
it as has been offered here the other
 
04:01:48.790 --> 04:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
option would be to itl the
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
bill so we have to decide what we want
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
to do between now and 3 o'cl
 
04:01:58.429 --> 04:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas yes um Just In
 
04:01:59.830 --> 04:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
fairness and I know it was mentioned
 
04:02:02.189 --> 04:02:02.199 align:start position:0%
earlier there has been another amendment
 
04:02:05.950 --> 04:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
that that was sent regarding 1700 and I
 
04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
I do think that that should be included
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
in the disc
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
discussion I haven't seen another
 
04:02:11.520 --> 04:02:13.950 align:start position:0%
discussion I haven't seen another
amendment

04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
so I I believe I got mine yesterday
 
04:02:22.870 --> 04:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah excuse me where was that
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
distributed yes representative PL uh
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%

more copies for those who have not

04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.189 --> 04:02:46.199 align:start position:0%
it okay I was just handed a copy it's
 
04:02:46.199 --> 04:02:47.670 align:start position:0%
it okay I was just handed a copy it's
Amendment

04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:02:47.680 --> 04:02:51.670 align:start position:0%
Amendment
20243

04:02:51.670 --> 04:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:58.750 --> 04:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
by replacing the original bill with all
 
04:03:04.469 --> 04:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
this new
 
04:03:07.269 --> 04:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
text so representative Thomas since you
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
brought this to our ition why don't you
 
04:03:13.149 --> 04:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
discuss this proposed amendment yay me
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh well I I do find the this this
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
particular amend Amendment problematic
 
04:03:20.750 --> 04:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
um but I do think it deserves a
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussion um just some general points
 
04:03:27.429 --> 04:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
um line six the general court finds that
 
04:03:29.429 --> 04:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
many atmospheric activities such as
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
weather modification blah blah blah
 
04:03:34.229 --> 04:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
there where are the statistics where are
 
04:03:36.149 --> 04:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
the reports for that you can't just
 
04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
claim that that those
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
um activities are harming human health
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
safety environment we can infer but you
 
04:03:48.670 --> 04:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:53.229 --> 04:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
um oh yeah so uh line 11 we we it talks
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
about intentionally polluting which is a
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
little different from weather seeding or
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding activities in New
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's atmosphere at or at ground
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
level so now we've introduced crop
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
spraying I guess is for for lack of a
 
04:04:11.359 --> 04:04:12.429 align:start position:0%
spraying I guess is for for lack of a
better

04:04:12.429 --> 04:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
word um so so that's problematic um on
 
04:04:21.389 --> 04:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
line 13 preserve the safe healthful and
 
04:04:21.399 --> 04:04:22.990 align:start position:0%
line 13 preserve the safe healthful and
peaceful

04:04:22.990 --> 04:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
peaceful
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
uses I don't know if there's a legal
 
04:04:27.550 --> 04:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
definition for peaceful uses but I think
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
that's problematic I could go on but but
 
04:04:34.030 --> 04:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
um I just I just think that this this
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Penza put some
 
04:04:37.990 --> 04:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
work into it and I just think we should
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
be discussing
 
04:04:44.149 --> 04:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
it okay further comment on the
 
04:04:46.590 --> 04:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that was just handed out
 
04:04:46.600 --> 04:04:48.269 align:start position:0%
amendment that was just handed out
amendment

04:04:48.269 --> 04:04:48.279 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:04:48.279 --> 04:04:49.870 align:start position:0%
amendment
number

04:04:49.870 --> 04:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
04:04:49.880 --> 04:04:51.950 align:start position:0%
number
0307

04:04:51.950 --> 04:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
0307
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
H representative
 
04:04:56.830 --> 04:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
Harrington well the amendment looks like
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
it was taken from some kind of a
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
template from some kind of a national uh
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
effort and um I think people put a lot
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
of work into this it just doesn't really
 
04:05:07.990 --> 04:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
fit New Hampshire I mean first of all
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
assigns all sorts of Duties to the
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
county sheriff who doesn't is not
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
involved in any type of uh environmental
 
04:05:18.790 --> 04:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
laws or enforcing them or figuring them
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
out uh it talks about All State climate
 
04:05:24.750 --> 04:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
related appointees must have been or
 
04:05:27.070 --> 04:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
administered the oath of office I don't
 
04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
know that we have any climate related
 
04:05:30.590 --> 04:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
appointees I don't know even what the
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
term means and if we did have them they
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
would have already been administered an
 
04:05:36.910 --> 04:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
oath of office um and then we have the
 
04:05:38.910 --> 04:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
sheriff reporting into the military
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services and they're
 
04:05:43.670 --> 04:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to do some kind of tracking
 
04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
with software or something and so forth
 
04:05:50.110 --> 04:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
and then the sheriff shall issue a cease
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
and assist order upon notification that
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
their discovery of stratospheric aerosol
 
04:05:57.070 --> 04:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
injection cloud seeding weather
 
04:05:58.630 --> 04:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
modification or other atmospheric
 
04:06:01.149 --> 04:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
polluting activity it doesn't say what
 
04:06:02.990 --> 04:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
those activities are it just says
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
polluting activity well you know that's
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
open to a lot of interpretation it
 
04:06:09.550 --> 04:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't say any limits on it doesn't say
 
04:06:11.950 --> 04:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
any you can you can do you cannot use
 
04:06:14.790 --> 04:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
this material uh this is banned in in
 
04:06:17.030 --> 04:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
these quantities so I mean it's just it
 
04:06:19.110 --> 04:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
just isn't it's just not ready for prime
 
04:06:23.790 --> 04:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:26.990 --> 04:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
so Vice chair Thomas has a comment thank
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I would agree with the last
 
04:06:32.189 --> 04:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
two Representatives this amendment
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
presents even more questions than the
 
04:06:37.309 --> 04:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment I proposed and since this
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
is an ear bill um I couldn't support
 
04:06:44.670 --> 04:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
this this amendment if we if we um have
 
04:06:46.590 --> 04:06:46.600 align:start position:0%
some doubts about the amendment that I
 
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
proposed then since this is an early
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
bill then absence of that I think the
 
04:06:53.149 --> 04:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
best course of action would be to just
 
04:06:55.229 --> 04:06:55.239 align:start position:0%
itail this bill to make sure that we
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
don't undo any guard rails until until
 
04:07:01.870 --> 04:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
we look into it so that's that's um one
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
course we can take now further comment
 
04:07:08.910 --> 04:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative fog uh thank you chair
 
04:07:12.189 --> 04:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
um work to working off um represent
 
04:07:12.199 --> 04:07:13.429 align:start position:0%
um work to working off um represent
Wendy

04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
Wendy
 
04:07:17.309 --> 04:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
Thomas's concern that if we have a
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
committee work
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
section the sponsor if there is any
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
documentations can present it to us so
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
we can see and that might bring up why
 
04:07:33.429 --> 04:07:33.439 align:start position:0%
the second part in 2021 was added as you
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
said it must be a reason and we can
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
actually ask
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
for legitimate concise
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
documentation so this bill this
 
04:07:45.790 --> 04:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
amendment could someday be Rewritten
 
04:07:45.800 --> 04:07:47.750 align:start position:0%
amendment could someday be Rewritten
thank

04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:07:53.910 --> 04:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.429 --> 04:07:56.439 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
Kennedy uh thank you I mean going back
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
to um Doug Thomas's
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
amendment can we can we you know pass
 
04:08:08.030 --> 04:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
that Amendment repeal that law and then
 
04:08:09.910 --> 04:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
if we want to we can introduce a law
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
modification so I did receive a an
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
email from Warren M Perry who is the
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
Deputy agitant
 
04:08:32.309 --> 04:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
general of the Department of military
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
Affairs and Veterans Services and he
 
04:08:39.389 --> 04:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
says we do not and cannot support the
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
provisions requiring us to review
 
04:08:45.109 --> 04:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
reported violative flights using flight
 
04:08:47.790 --> 04:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
tracking software to determine time and
 
04:08:51.030 --> 04:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
location of the plane's passage page two
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
lines 15 through
 
04:08:55.469 --> 04:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
20 we are also concerned about the
 
04:08:57.389 --> 04:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
requirement to issue notice to federal
 
04:09:00.870 --> 04:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
agencies page two lines 28 to
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
30 our air traffic control operations
 
04:09:05.550 --> 04:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
are fully funded by the federal
 
04:09:07.109 --> 04:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
government and support of federal

missions and conducted by the New
 
04:09:11.910 --> 04:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard we cannot
 
04:09:13.309 --> 04:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
support these requirements in a
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
federally funded status compliance with
 
04:09:18.109 --> 04:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
these requirements will require those
 
04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
National Guard personnel and our
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
equipment to be ordered into State
 
04:09:25.510 --> 04:09:25.520 align:start position:0%

04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
so that would seem to be a negative of
 
04:09:33.680 --> 04:09:34.710 align:start position:0%
so that would seem to be a negative of
this

04:09:34.710 --> 04:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:09:37.830 --> 04:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
particular Amendment further discussion
 
04:09:40.469 --> 04:09:40.479 align:start position:0%
question representative McGee so Mr
 
04:09:42.149 --> 04:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
chair based on the information you just
 
04:09:43.950 --> 04:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
provided does that mean that we're back
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
to representative Thomas's Amendment and
 
04:09:47.109 --> 04:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
the disposition that we're trying to
 
04:09:49.710 --> 04:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
come up with for whether we're going to
 
04:09:52.109 --> 04:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
adopt or itl that
 
04:09:54.990 --> 04:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes I or actually
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams had a third
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
option right which was a moratorium on
 
04:10:02.830 --> 04:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
part one until we could determine if
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
there were changes that needed to be
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
made to 12f is that right so if we were
 
04:10:10.870 --> 04:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to consider a moratorium on part
 
04:10:12.990 --> 04:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
one we would need language do you have
 
04:10:15.349 --> 04:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
language representative
 
04:10:17.229 --> 04:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
McWilliams I'm happy to scratch
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
something out and send it to OS before
 
04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
we EXA if you'd
 
04:10:23.269 --> 04:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
like okay why don't you do that and when
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
you get something please uh share it
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
with the rest of us and we'll decide if
 
04:10:30.109 --> 04:10:30.119 align:start position:0%
we want to pursue that or not
 
04:10:30.119 --> 04:10:31.710 align:start position:0%
we want to pursue that or not
representative

04:10:31.710 --> 04:10:31.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:10:36.189 --> 04:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
PL thank you chair um in that
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
moratorium it does no good if there is
 
04:10:40.670 --> 04:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
no work
 
04:10:44.590 --> 04:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
session of this committee to see what
 
04:10:47.109 --> 04:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
the reason is just by having moratorium
 
04:10:49.670 --> 04:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
we don't look at for we need to set up
 
04:10:53.229 --> 04:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
some sort of Comm committee to look into
 
04:10:56.429 --> 04:10:56.439 align:start position:0%
it from my perspective thank
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.040 --> 04:11:03.550 align:start position:0%
 
then

04:11:03.550 --> 04:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:11:06.070 --> 04:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
um if uh represented
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
mcams is willing if she could add
 
04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
in a b po spin uh work session from this
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
committee to look at any documentations
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
of during that moratorium do we continue
 
04:11:25.750 --> 04:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
it was there a
 
04:11:28.510 --> 04:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
reason or even bring it back it might be
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
a reason we need to have that but
 
04:11:35.229 --> 04:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
without documentation and calling in um
 
04:11:37.670 --> 04:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm not sure where moror would
 
04:11:37.680 --> 04:11:38.830 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm not sure where moror would
just

04:11:38.830 --> 04:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:11:41.389 --> 04:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
still well here's another
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
option we could just refer this bill
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
from interim study for interim study and
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
then this committee can spend several
 
04:11:51.149 --> 04:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
hours next fall looking at it and
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
do any reaction representative
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
fog yes with dual diligence and um
 
04:12:04.950 --> 04:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
consideration from the chair I was asked
 
04:12:09.030 --> 04:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
do testimony at another committee may be
 
04:12:11.710 --> 04:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
excused you can thank you thank you
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not necessarily opposed to
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
moratorium I just don't know if we
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
recognize that there will be unintended
 
04:12:24.349 --> 04:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
consequences from the reading that
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Corman read out it
 
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned Federal and other states if if
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
I heard it correctly and and so are we
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
cutting off relations with with the
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
federal government and other states
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
completely by by repealing this for this
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
for this topic
 
04:12:46.830 --> 04:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
anyway possibly so yeah I think that's
 
04:12:48.670 --> 04:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
which might be another reason to put
 
04:12:52.109 --> 04:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
this bill into interim study
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
yeah representative bney thank you
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
chairman um so this my understanding is
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
section one is the part that's been on
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
the book since
 
04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
1985 so it seems like it's been on the
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
books for that long it hasn't been used
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
2year moratory
 
04:13:09.870 --> 04:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
is there is there something happening in
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
the next two years or what's what's all
 
04:13:14.670 --> 04:13:14.680 align:start position:0%
of the sudden after 1985 uh that would
 
04:13:17.149 --> 04:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
be my question you are not and it's a
 
04:13:17.159 --> 04:13:17.870 align:start position:0%
be my question you are not and it's a
good

04:13:17.870 --> 04:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:13:21.309 --> 04:13:21.319 align:start position:0%
one represent Vice chair Thomas yes Mr
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
chair um uh all good suggestions but I'm
 
04:13:28.109 --> 04:13:28.119 align:start position:0%
looking at the original bill and the one
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the proposed amendments and the
 
04:13:30.990 --> 04:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
discussion we've had
 
04:13:34.109 --> 04:13:34.119 align:start position:0%
here I don't believe I uh interim study
 
04:13:36.510 --> 04:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
is going to really result in any Earth
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
shattering change uh a new bill uh next
 
04:13:43.710 --> 04:13:43.720 align:start position:0%
year maybe uh with some thought into it
 
04:13:46.429 --> 04:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
but if we if we do an itl then we're
 
04:13:48.109 --> 04:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
basically leaving the president language
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
intact preserving the guard rails and so
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
um try the moratorium to the previous
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative's Point may give us some
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
time to come up with the same conclusion
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure uh if we don't enact the
 
04:14:06.630 --> 04:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to do away with the entire RSA
 
04:14:08.910 --> 04:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
which I can see some points about what
 
04:14:12.030 --> 04:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
about why we may not then a simple itl
 
04:14:15.269 --> 04:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
leaves that RSA intact at least until
 
04:14:17.790 --> 04:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
maybe at some other time a different
 
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
language might uh might come up so
 
04:14:22.950 --> 04:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise I think is uh is not going to
 
04:14:24.149 --> 04:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
give us
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
much okay well what regardless of what
 
04:14:29.670 --> 04:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
we decide in executive session we're
 
04:14:32.710 --> 04:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
done with this for now because uh we're
 
04:14:35.149 --> 04:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
going to suspend this work session at
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
2:45 for a Republican caucus so we need
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
to move on to the other bills on the
 
04:14:42.670 --> 04:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
schedule if you want to discuss them
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
before the executive session so how
 
04:14:48.550 --> 04:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
about we discuss HB
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
1036 and an amendment prepared by
 
04:15:07.229 --> 04:15:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
indicated that there was a lack of
 
04:15:13.109 --> 04:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility provided to the Public
 
04:15:15.030 --> 04:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission by the language and
 
04:15:15.040 --> 04:15:15.710 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission by the language and
the

04:15:15.710 --> 04:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:20.670 --> 04:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
original um statute and while
 
04:15:22.990 --> 04:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and I both
 
04:15:23.000 --> 04:15:24.910 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington and I both
love

04:15:24.910 --> 04:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
love
 
04:15:24.920 --> 04:15:26.830 align:start position:0%
love
Simplicity

04:15:26.830 --> 04:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
Simplicity
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
striking uh the words for the purpose of
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
March 21st 2022
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
filing or maybe it was future plans
 
04:15:36.590 --> 04:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
offerings I forget exactly what it
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
struck but while that was simple and
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
elegant it was true Draconian in terms
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
of what it meant for the rest of the
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
statute so this amendment does provide
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
some flexibility to the commission going
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
forward but does not invalidate or uh
 
04:16:00.269 --> 04:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
allow the commit the commission to
 
04:16:02.670 --> 04:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
ignore the granite state
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
test when it does its future
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
deliberations on this topic so I think
 
04:16:12.670 --> 04:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
this is a good amendment I I uh like the
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
fact that it provides additional
 
04:16:17.429 --> 04:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the commission but keeps
 
04:16:22.269 --> 04:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
the granite state test intact for the
 
04:16:26.149 --> 04:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh as the primary test along with the
 
04:16:28.030 --> 04:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
addition of the Total Resource cost as a
 
04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
secondary test for evaluating these cost
 
04:16:31.720 --> 04:16:34.309 align:start position:0%
secondary test for evaluating these cost

04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
04:16:40.590 --> 04:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
can I take a look at your language
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
because I can't put my hand on it thank
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
you um I I understand the explanation
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
that you gave I think that that's uh you
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
know a reasonable start point for a
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
discussion but the amendment as written
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
um basically the language that I would
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
take exception with says the commission
 
04:17:01.149 --> 04:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
may approve modifications to the granite
 
04:17:01.159 --> 04:17:02.109 align:start position:0%
may approve modifications to the granite
state

04:17:02.109 --> 04:17:02.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
test um or adopt different or additional
 
04:17:06.080 --> 04:17:07.469 align:start position:0%
test um or adopt different or additional
tests

04:17:07.469 --> 04:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
tests
 
04:17:10.510 --> 04:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
and uh prior to the commencement of any
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
trianium period after 2027 so I I
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
actually think that substantively this
 
04:17:19.109 --> 04:17:19.119 align:start position:0%
language is the same as the original
 
04:17:22.189 --> 04:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
bill in that it's providing the Pu with
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to modify the granite state
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
test um in order
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
to uh I I don't know secure specific
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
outcomes I guess the granite state test
 
04:17:38.229 --> 04:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
to my understanding and I had a
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with um with Mr LCA about
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
this it was sort of it was a there were
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
long discussions and it was kind of a
 
04:17:50.830 --> 04:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
hard one set of a
 
04:17:52.990 --> 04:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
calculation uh that was agreed upon by
 
04:17:57.070 --> 04:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
all parties including the Pu and this
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
language basically says that they can
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
change it so they don't have to use it
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
as is um and that's what we were trying
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
to avoid I think the test that we heard
 
04:18:10.349 --> 04:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
in um in the
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
hearings uh there were quite a few
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
people who
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
opposed uh allowing the Pu to not use
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
the the granite state test as it was
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
intended and the discussions around
 
04:18:26.149 --> 04:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh not being the same had
 
04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
everything to do with the inputs that
 
04:18:29.630 --> 04:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
they were using and not necessarily the
 
04:18:32.070 --> 04:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
formula that is the granite state test
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
so maybe we should educate the committee
 
04:18:39.550 --> 04:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh further on what the granite state is
 
04:18:41.429 --> 04:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
and isn't because I think what this
 
04:18:44.790 --> 04:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
language does is say if the commission
 
04:18:47.229 --> 04:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
wants to change the granite state test
 
04:18:50.590 --> 04:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
it can and I would be opposed to
 
04:18:53.309 --> 04:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
um yes although this bill permits the
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
revision of the grand state test it says
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
that it must be done uh pursu to a um
 
04:19:13.950 --> 04:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
agative process and it has to be done 18
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
months before any new test is going to
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
be used so you certainly have an
 
04:19:22.870 --> 04:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to understand what changes
 
04:19:25.550 --> 04:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
are being made and why they're being
 
04:19:29.269 --> 04:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
made uh and if they're relevant or if
 
04:19:34.590 --> 04:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
they're problematic so um as I remember
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
the testimony one of the biggest factors
 
04:19:42.670 --> 04:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
was uh um what is the appropriate
 
04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
discount rate to be used and and uh you
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
know I I think that is a relevant point
 
04:19:51.910 --> 04:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
of discussion and if it has to be
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
discussed 18 months before you make that
 
04:19:57.109 --> 04:19:57.119 align:start position:0%
change I don't I don't see a a big
 
04:20:00.510 --> 04:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
concern here may I respond yes I think I
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
would agree with uh representative
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
Bernardi that the language clearly says
 
04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
that any change that they make has to be
 
04:20:09.429 --> 04:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
through an adjudicative
 
04:20:11.830 --> 04:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
process and the order issued no less
 
04:20:13.550 --> 04:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
than 18 months prior to the beginning of
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
the trianium period so um I I think your
 
04:20:24.070 --> 04:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
objection is is that this is essentially
 
04:20:27.189 --> 04:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
the same bill is not accurate um well
 
04:20:30.389 --> 04:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
let me explain the sentence says the
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
commission may approve modifications to
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
the granite state test or adopt
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
different additional tests prior to the
 
04:20:39.790 --> 04:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
commencement of any triangual period
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
beginning with the program and shall do
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
so by order of so with this language
 
04:20:47.070 --> 04:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
they can adopt different or additional
 
04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
tests prior to the commencement of any
 
04:20:51.550 --> 04:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
trianium period if it goes through an
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding but where the
 
04:20:57.550 --> 04:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
where the or comes in it the first half
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
of the sentence gives the commission the
 
04:21:01.510 --> 04:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
approval of
 
04:21:04.189 --> 04:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
modifications so I I don't I don't see
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
the the remainder of the sentence on
 
04:21:08.710 --> 04:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
developed through a judicative process I
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't see that as modifying the original
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
part of the sentence because it's an
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
either or well that's clearly what it
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
says it says that the granite state test
 
04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
or modifications made to the granite
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
state test or different or additional
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
tests prior to the commencement of the
 
04:21:28.870 --> 04:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:21:33.550 --> 04:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
program shall uh it shall do so by order
 
04:21:35.349 --> 04:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
provided that any change is developed
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
through an adjudicate itive process so
 
04:21:40.750 --> 04:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
the order is the result of the Jud
 
04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
judicative process that's the only way
 
04:21:45.309 --> 04:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
you can make a change we have an English
 
04:21:47.149 --> 04:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
M that's not what it says who should
 
04:21:48.790 --> 04:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
04:21:48.800 --> 04:21:56.790 align:start position:0%
comment on
this

04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.349 --> 04:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative kman you have a
 
04:22:02.070 --> 04:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
comment uh I I do but it's not not about
 
04:22:07.469 --> 04:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
the um the either or um I my concern is
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
that uh yes it would be through an
 
04:22:11.429 --> 04:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process but who who are the
 
04:22:14.389 --> 04:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
adjudicators is it not the Pu they so
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
they they could say well we think we
 
04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
want this other test and then they
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
adjudicate yeah we're going to use this
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
other test so the legislatur then
 
04:22:27.309 --> 04:22:27.319 align:start position:0%
seeding the authority of what test it is
 
04:22:32.229 --> 04:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
Pu uh repres representative Harrington
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
wants to speak on his Amendment thank
 
04:22:41.309 --> 04:22:41.319 align:start position:0%
you first of all the gron state test did
 
04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
not come down from the mount with the
 
04:22:45.550 --> 04:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
Ten Commandments it was developed by the
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
puc in the late teens with input from
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
all sorts of different groups and people
 
04:22:51.870 --> 04:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
and it was a lot of work there was
 
04:22:54.269 --> 04:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
outside Consultants were brought in it
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
was reports written and eventually it
 
04:22:58.349 --> 04:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
was decided upon as the way to go at
 
04:23:01.109 --> 04:23:01.119 align:start position:0%
that time by the time this would kick in
 
04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
this amendment most of that analysis
 
04:23:06.070 --> 04:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
would be pushing 10 years old and all
 
04:23:08.349 --> 04:23:08.359 align:start position:0%
this says it's the same people that
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
approved the granted state test the same
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
people that went through that process
 
04:23:15.189 --> 04:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
and well the same organization that came
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
up with it uh turned around and now
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to say they can never
 
04:23:21.870 --> 04:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
change that again unless we change the
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
law that simply isn't the way we do
 
04:23:26.670 --> 04:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
things I mean we if you go to the Pu why
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
have them if they can't change uh
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
something when circumstances change we
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
allow them to change rates all the time
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
now I know ever Source likes it staying
 
04:23:37.030 --> 04:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
the way it is could simpler for them and
 
04:23:38.790 --> 04:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
the utilities they don't have to change
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
everything they can do it exactly the
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
same way they did last year next year
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the year after and the year after
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
but that might not necessarily be the
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
best way all this allows is that the
 
04:23:50.189 --> 04:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
people that get nominated by the
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
governor and approved by the executive
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
counsil to be Public Utilities
 
04:23:54.750 --> 04:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners can go through an
 
04:23:56.670 --> 04:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process that is totally
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
open to the public the consumer Advocate
 
04:24:01.229 --> 04:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
would be there testifying members of
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
this committee could testify members
 
04:24:05.149 --> 04:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
from the utilities could testify people
 
04:24:07.510 --> 04:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
from clean New Hampshire could testify
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
they'd all have input in in standing on
 
04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
this process and then they would allow
 
04:24:13.750 --> 04:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the process to come to folish a second
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
time maybe they would use the exact same
 
04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
test the granted State uh test maybe
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
they would make no changes but maybe
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances would say it's best to
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
make some changes this simply allows the
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility for them to do that and
 
04:24:30.229 --> 04:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
remember if the legislature really hated
 
04:24:31.830 --> 04:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
what they did they could always come
 
04:24:33.510 --> 04:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
back the next year and change the law
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
and say no you can't do that but I think
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
we don't don't want ra those type of
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
regulations on that technical matters
 
04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
that you're dealing with here with very
 
04:24:44.550 --> 04:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
very heavy details this committee is not
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
the place to do that level just like we
 
04:24:48.750 --> 04:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
don't do rate cases here because it's a
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
very very complicated uh economics
 
04:24:55.349 --> 04:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
physics engineering legal and the great
 
04:24:57.070 --> 04:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
place to do that is the Pu that's why we
 
04:24:57.080 --> 04:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
place to do that is the Pu that's why we
have

04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
04:25:04.590 --> 04:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
McGee just the thought that I had in
 
04:25:06.269 --> 04:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
looking at this is that there was no
 
04:25:09.109 --> 04:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
case made as to as to what is wrong with
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
the granite state test right so what
 
04:25:11.870 --> 04:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're saying we're going
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the granite state test or
 
04:25:15.710 --> 04:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
allow it to be modified to be something
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
other than the granite state test and
 
04:25:20.349 --> 04:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
there may or may not be uh an
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding to to to regroup
 
04:25:26.830 --> 04:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
around what that new iteration would be
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
but we haven't established that we are
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
throwing the baby out with the bath
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
water for any particular reason right we
 
04:25:35.510 --> 04:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
did establish in the hearings at least
 
04:25:36.910 --> 04:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
we heard in in the hearings from the
 
04:25:39.950 --> 04:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate that that there was a
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
dislike of the granite state test by a
 
04:25:46.070 --> 04:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
particular commissioner and that if they
 
04:25:48.550 --> 04:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
were allowed to modify or do away with
 
04:25:50.910 --> 04:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
the test that they would do so and so
 
04:25:54.189 --> 04:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
from our standpoint as legislators I
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
think we should be looking at whether or
 
04:25:58.910 --> 04:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
not the granite state test has stood the
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
test of time and if we don't understand
 
04:26:02.910 --> 04:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
well enough about what it is and what it
 
04:26:05.309 --> 04:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
isn't then we shouldn't be asking for it
 
04:26:07.229 --> 04:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
to be eliminated when we have no idea
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
what it will be replaced with because it
 
04:26:11.550 --> 04:26:11.560 align:start position:0%
seems like that is an arbitrary position
 
04:26:13.309 --> 04:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
whereas at least all the players right
 
04:26:15.030 --> 04:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
now know what the granite state test is
 
04:26:17.070 --> 04:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
and they're they're well used to it
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
could I respond please Mr chairman okay
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah well
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
first of all I don't think we should be
 
04:26:26.269 --> 04:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
getting into uh the policies or
 
04:26:28.229 --> 04:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
personalities of who's on the Pu and who
 
04:26:30.710 --> 04:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't whoever's on there has been
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
nominated by the governor and approved
 
04:26:34.469 --> 04:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
by the executive councel and most of the
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
people are there now's terms will be up
 
04:26:39.070 --> 04:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
well before 2027 so if you really want
 
04:26:40.710 --> 04:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
to change them out there's a way to do
 
04:26:42.189 --> 04:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
that but I don't think it's bringing
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
their opinions like that up someone says
 
04:26:46.830 --> 04:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
they think some pu Commissioners against
 
04:26:48.109 --> 04:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
it I think it's a slight to the
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
commission so and the second thing this
 
04:26:53.510 --> 04:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
only allows the commission to do what it
 
04:26:56.109 --> 04:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
does constantly we do this all the time
 
04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to do this a couple of
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
times this year they're going to be
 
04:27:00.630 --> 04:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
setting rates we don't come in here and
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
say oh we'll set the rate the default
 
04:27:04.950 --> 04:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
service rate and you got to stay with
 
04:27:07.269 --> 04:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
that methodology to set it and you can't
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
change it ever even if things
 
04:27:11.149 --> 04:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
drastically change all this does is give
 
04:27:14.109 --> 04:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
them flexibility to make changes if and
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
when they feel they're necessary and
 
04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
through an full full judicative process
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
which will take months of public
 
04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
hearings testimony and everything you
 
04:27:25.309 --> 04:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
can think of with people coming in
 
04:27:27.189 --> 04:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
experts from all different sides and all
 
04:27:29.229 --> 04:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
different opinions it's a very detailed
 
04:27:31.830 --> 04:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
thorough process and we just all I'm
 
04:27:33.429 --> 04:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
saying on this is I think they've
 
04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
requested and I think that they should
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility to relook at this
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be dictating something of
 
04:27:41.710 --> 04:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
this technical a nature to the specifics
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
for the Pu that's why we have a
 
04:27:46.269 --> 04:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
pu representative
 
04:27:48.590 --> 04:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman I just want
 
04:27:52.750 --> 04:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
to speak up uh in support of uh
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative McGee's main contention
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
that um you know this bill and the
 
04:28:04.790 --> 04:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill is premised on
 
04:28:07.269 --> 04:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
the idea that there's something wrong
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
with the way that Energy Efficiency
 
04:28:15.229 --> 04:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
programs in this state uh are evaluated
 
04:28:16.429 --> 04:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
and I want to refer back to
 
04:28:18.429 --> 04:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's comments
 
04:28:21.910 --> 04:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
about how is uh you know very apt
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
description of
 
04:28:26.910 --> 04:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
how the granite state test was developed
 
04:28:29.750 --> 04:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
through a very lengthy
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
involved deliberative
 
04:28:32.520 --> 04:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
involved deliberative
consultative

04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
consultative
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
process you know just five six years ago
 
04:28:39.990 --> 04:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
and this is let's remember what this is
 
04:28:40.000 --> 04:28:41.149 align:start position:0%
and this is let's remember what this is
all

04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
about this is all about how the state of
 
04:28:44.199 --> 04:28:45.269 align:start position:0%
about this is all about how the state of
New

04:28:45.269 --> 04:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:28:47.910 --> 04:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire makes a judgment about the
 
04:28:47.920 --> 04:28:49.469 align:start position:0%
Hampshire makes a judgment about the
cost

04:28:49.469 --> 04:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:28:54.349 --> 04:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of our present investment
 
04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
and future or or if you want present
 
04:29:01.109 --> 04:29:01.119 align:start position:0%
cost and future benefit
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
of you know I'll call them micro
 
04:29:06.750 --> 04:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
investments in Energy Efficiency
 
04:29:09.030 --> 04:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
right we Levy the systems benefits
 
04:29:11.550 --> 04:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
charge we support the New Hampshire
 
04:29:11.560 --> 04:29:15.229 align:start position:0%
charge we support the New Hampshire
saves

04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:18.269 --> 04:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
programs thousands of projects are are
 
04:29:20.630 --> 04:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh completed every year throughout the
 
04:29:23.630 --> 04:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
state and investing in lighting upgrades
 
04:29:26.830 --> 04:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
and insulation installation and things
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
like that and so this whole debate about
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
Granite State tests cost effect it's all
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
about present cost future benefits so a
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
lot of work was put in
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
um by many parties to come up with with
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
a formula and that's what the granite
 
04:29:43.269 --> 04:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
state test is a Formula methodology for
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
making that evaluation now as the years
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
go by it's certainly possible in fact
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's likely that the uh values that are
 
04:29:56.790 --> 04:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
used in the calculations pursuant to the
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
formula might change from five six years
 
04:30:02.349 --> 04:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
ago to now through next but I really
 
04:30:03.750 --> 04:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
04:30:06.269 --> 04:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
that every five years the legislature
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
needs to pass a law and direct you know
 
04:30:11.710 --> 04:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
let's let's go back and and rehash the
 
04:30:14.349 --> 04:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
whole debate about cost effectiveness of
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
investments in Energy Efficiency
 
04:30:20.109 --> 04:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
programs uh in in something as uh I'll
 
04:30:24.309 --> 04:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
call it obscure to the public as a pu uh
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process uh it's just not
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
necessary um I we are the state that in
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
New England that invests by far the
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
least in um in these in these Energy
 
04:30:40.189 --> 04:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs uh and and you know
 
04:30:42.309 --> 04:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
we've got to a point finally 5 years ago
 
04:30:44.189 --> 04:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
and I thought people thought you know
 
04:30:46.269 --> 04:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
even as late as two years ago where we
 
04:30:49.109 --> 04:30:49.119 align:start position:0%
had bipartisan agreement on the modest
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
Investments that we would make each year
 
04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
but still we have a bills doing this
 
04:30:56.349 --> 04:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
that are kind of oh let's go back and
 
04:30:59.389 --> 04:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
and re-evaluate and and and evaluate the
 
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
methodology I just don't think it's
 
04:31:02.870 --> 04:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
necessary I oppose the amendment I'm
 
04:31:05.229 --> 04:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
going to oppose the bill okay good thank
 
04:31:05.239 --> 04:31:06.189 align:start position:0%
going to oppose the bill okay good thank
you

04:31:06.189 --> 04:31:06.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:31:08.309 --> 04:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
so where did the granite state test come
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
from it came from an adjudicative
 
04:31:13.229 --> 04:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
process at the
 
04:31:17.349 --> 04:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
Pu and this amendment wants to give the
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
Pu the flexibility to make changes to
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
the granite state test through an
 
04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process it's exactly the
 
04:31:26.000 --> 04:31:26.910 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process it's exactly the
same

04:31:26.910 --> 04:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:31:29.309 --> 04:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
thing as what came up with the test to
 
04:31:29.319 --> 04:31:30.990 align:start position:0%
thing as what came up with the test to
begin

04:31:30.990 --> 04:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
begin
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
with I I just don't see why this would
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
be considered to be a problem
 
04:31:38.349 --> 04:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
but obviously we're not going to uh
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
agree on this one so let's move on and
 
04:31:45.109 --> 04:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
take a look at House Bill
 
04:31:49.469 --> 04:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
1078 so this uh amendment to House Bill
 
04:31:52.830 --> 04:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
1078 2024
 
04:31:57.870 --> 04:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
0301 H was submitted by representative
 
04:32:00.910 --> 04:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
Bernardi and it fairly substantially
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
changes U how this
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill approached this
 
04:32:10.349 --> 04:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
subject initially or originally so
 
04:32:12.510 --> 04:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi could you give
 
04:32:15.269 --> 04:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
us an explanation for how do this change
 
04:32:20.109 --> 04:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
would work am y this was distributed
 
04:32:20.119 --> 04:32:21.670 align:start position:0%
would work am y this was distributed
yesterday

04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:32:21.680 --> 04:32:29.389 align:start position:0%
yesterday
20243

04:32:29.389 --> 04:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.399 --> 04:32:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
01h

04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
01h
 
04:32:34.510 --> 04:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
so if you remember this bill initially
 
04:32:36.070 --> 04:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
04:32:40.790 --> 04:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
to give uh First Responders a priority
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
spot on the top of
 
04:32:43.080 --> 04:32:44.910 align:start position:0%
spot on the top of
uh

04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
communication uh Towers to uh deal with
 
04:32:52.109 --> 04:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
essentially black holes or gaps in
 
04:32:54.510 --> 04:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
communication that occur in many
 
04:32:54.520 --> 04:32:56.070 align:start position:0%
communication that occur in many
communities

04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh in that hearing the uh
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety uh suggested that
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
was not a good approach for multiple
 
04:33:13.150 --> 04:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
reasons uh but suggested that uh
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
engineering study should be done to
 
04:33:18.269 --> 04:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
identify where those gaps were and that
 
04:33:21.029 --> 04:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh that all good uh telecommunications
 
04:33:25.150 --> 04:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
folks would be just delighted to provide
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
uh spots to deal with these problems if
 
04:33:31.990 --> 04:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate kind Communications were
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
held um so an initial draft of this
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
amendment followed that approach but
 
04:33:42.990 --> 04:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
then that was subsequently reviewed uh
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Safety and they
 
04:33:51.750 --> 04:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat changed their mind um and so uh
 
04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
I think it was largely because the cost
 
04:33:56.750 --> 04:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
of them doing engineering studies to
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
identify where the gaps were um and what
 
04:34:02.470 --> 04:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
the potential opportunities for filling
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
them were would would be a uh a head
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
count that they did not have in the
 
04:34:09.269 --> 04:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
department at that time and it's not in
 
04:34:12.510 --> 04:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
the current budget and therefore um we
 
04:34:14.230 --> 04:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
needed to come up with a different
 
04:34:20.230 --> 04:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
approach so the approach is to uh have
 
04:34:23.470 --> 04:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
them investigate these uh the gaps
 
04:34:26.189 --> 04:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
without doing formal engineering studies
 
04:34:28.189 --> 04:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
and then come up with
 
04:34:32.109 --> 04:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh on strategies of how
 
04:34:35.269 --> 04:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
how this problem could be addressed
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:41.709 --> 04:34:41.719 align:start position:0%
legislation okay so that's the amendment
 
04:34:44.429 --> 04:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a comment yes
 
04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
I do um I believe in giving credit where
 
04:34:48.629 --> 04:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
credit is due and I think that this
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is a good
 
04:34:53.310 --> 04:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
solution thank you representative
 
04:34:55.310 --> 04:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
Ms guess I have a question for
 
04:34:58.109 --> 04:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi as I read the
 
04:35:01.990 --> 04:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um it's still in it it it
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
still leaves in place section one of the
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:35:08.310 --> 04:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
yeah correct it doesn't change the
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
current statute at all the only thing
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's new is section two which was
 
04:35:16.709 --> 04:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
where the original bill was focused as
 
04:35:20.070 --> 04:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
well um so I I haven't we haven't done
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
anything with the Emergency Management
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
powers and duties of uh regarding
 
04:35:26.510 --> 04:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
communication systems that's current
 
04:35:26.520 --> 04:35:27.910 align:start position:0%
communication systems that's current
statutory

04:35:27.910 --> 04:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
04:35:31.789 --> 04:35:31.799 align:start position:0%
language uh just just follow up yes the
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
original bill in section one included
 
04:35:39.750 --> 04:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.349 --> 04:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
language that talks about U the priority
 
04:35:45.750 --> 04:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
that that that grants the uh First
 
04:35:49.750 --> 04:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
Responders the top 20 feet right well
 
04:35:52.349 --> 04:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
okay so in the rewrite that is that has
 
04:35:57.150 --> 04:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
been put as sub paragraph two but that's
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
not what the amendment says the
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
amendment says it's
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
adding the new section two after section
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
one in the original bill and the
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
original Bill section one includes subp
 
04:36:08.879 --> 04:36:13.269 align:start position:0%
original Bill section one includes subp
paragraph

04:36:13.269 --> 04:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:16.551 --> 04:36:16.561 align:start position:0%
B yes but that's not that's not what the
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.470 --> 04:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
okay so representative McGee I didn't
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
hear what you said because you didn't
 
04:36:28.150 --> 04:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
turn on your mic I'm sorry yeah I just
 
04:36:29.629 --> 04:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
was looking at the original Bill and
 
04:36:31.830 --> 04:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
noticing that that section B was the
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
part that had the upper 20 feet which
 
04:36:37.109 --> 04:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
was PL perceived to be problematic so I
 
04:36:38.990 --> 04:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
think that part was stricken and
 
04:36:40.830 --> 04:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
replaced by the new language that they
 
04:36:42.551 --> 04:36:42.561 align:start position:0%
wanted to add is that correct yes that
 
04:36:42.561 --> 04:36:44.629 align:start position:0%
wanted to add is that correct yes that
is

04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:36:46.750 --> 04:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
correct but again that's not what the
 
04:36:48.629 --> 04:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
bill says I don't
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
believe it says amend the
 
04:36:54.750 --> 04:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
bill so it's the original bill after
 
04:36:54.760 --> 04:36:55.949 align:start position:0%
bill so it's the original bill after
section

04:36:55.949 --> 04:36:55.959 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
one the follow and the following and
 
04:37:00.269 --> 04:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
renumbering the original section two to
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
read is number three section one in the
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
original Bill includes subparagraph
 
04:37:09.269 --> 04:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
B so it needs to be deleted so so you're
 
04:37:11.830 --> 04:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
speaking of lines six and seven though
 
04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
those appear to be an
 
04:37:14.160 --> 04:37:18.070 align:start position:0%
those appear to be an
error

04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.949 --> 04:37:20.959 align:start position:0%
yes you need to get rid of
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
16 is the intent that this would replace
 
04:37:26.029 --> 04:37:26.039 align:start position:0%
section one altoe or just replace uh
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
paragraph B paragraph B replace
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph B that's what it should say
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
yeah all right I'm sorry I focused in
 
04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:36.039 align:start position:0%
only on the amend language I didn't
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:47.310 --> 04:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
top all right so amend the bill by
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
inserting after section one the
 
04:37:53.390 --> 04:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
following and ruming the original
 
04:38:00.109 --> 04:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
three I believe it should delete
 
04:38:08.349 --> 04:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
right and then just add this as SE the
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
B and re the original section two to
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
original and
 
04:38:46.670 --> 04:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
renumber section
 
04:38:50.230 --> 04:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.910 --> 04:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
originaly has
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:02.709 --> 04:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
rney all right we know what needs to be
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
done so yes representative thank you if
 
04:39:08.910 --> 04:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
I may be so picky um if you look at the
 
04:39:13.709 --> 04:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
original Bill line three also has a very
 
04:39:17.070 --> 04:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
small change where it adds a paragraph a
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
and if we're removing paragraph B then
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
we need to also remove the little a for
 
04:39:21.600 --> 04:39:27.789 align:start position:0%
we need to also remove the little a for
paragraph

04:39:27.789 --> 04:39:27.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.799 --> 04:39:31.029 align:start position:0%
 
a

04:39:31.029 --> 04:39:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
okay you know what that
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
means I have to get the
 
04:39:35.680 --> 04:39:37.350 align:start position:0%
means I have to get the
yeah

04:39:37.350 --> 04:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:39:39.150 --> 04:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
okay did you have a comment
 
04:39:39.160 --> 04:39:44.628 align:start position:0%
okay did you have a comment
representative

04:39:44.628 --> 04:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:47.470 --> 04:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
Kennedy the amendment has no effective
 
04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
date because the effective date is on
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:57.868 --> 04:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
itself representative Berney uh thank
 
04:39:59.430 --> 04:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
you chairman I was just going to add
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to just have the uh
 
04:40:04.830 --> 04:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
language B uh amend everything after the
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
encant clause and just have that be
 
04:40:07.990 --> 04:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
because that's the only change right in
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
this in this amendment so just have the
 
04:40:14.470 --> 04:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:22.628 --> 04:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.390 --> 04:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Corman thank you I
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
have one other question um the amendment
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
says that uh the there would be a report
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
issued to the general court usually when
 
04:40:36.430 --> 04:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
I see these bills it lists various
 
04:40:38.590 --> 04:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
officers in the general court that
 
04:40:42.150 --> 04:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
reports go to and I'm just wondering if
 
04:40:44.628 --> 04:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
this should be like those
 
04:40:44.638 --> 04:40:47.868 align:start position:0%
this should be like those
other

04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:50.110 --> 04:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
bills you mean the speaker of the house
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the president of the speaker
 
04:40:56.270 --> 04:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
yes the general court is led by those
 
04:40:59.798 --> 04:41:00.948 align:start position:0%
yes the general court is led by those
people

04:41:00.948 --> 04:41:00.958 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:41:03.670 --> 04:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
so I would guess if I was going to
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
deliver this report that who I'd send it
 
04:41:06.360 --> 04:41:07.990 align:start position:0%
deliver this report that who I'd send it
to

04:41:07.990 --> 04:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:11.910 --> 04:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
but it is a good it is a good um catch I
 
04:41:11.920 --> 04:41:13.590 align:start position:0%
but it is a good it is a good um catch I
think

04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:41:18.708 --> 04:41:18.718 align:start position:0%
so has anybody seen chrisy recently just
 
04:41:20.708 --> 04:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
want we're going to need to have
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
somebody um contact OS she's researching
 
04:41:26.788 --> 04:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
cloud seating she's researching what
 
04:41:29.110 --> 04:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
she's researching cloud seating oh cloud
 
04:41:29.120 --> 04:41:31.430 align:start position:0%
she's researching cloud seating oh cloud
seating

04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
seating
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
right all right well while we have a
 
04:41:36.470 --> 04:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
minute you know since we're going to
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
need to make some changes to this
 
04:41:41.390 --> 04:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
amendment let's talk very very briefly
 
04:41:43.070 --> 04:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
about hb1
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
1472 relative to rebates for Energy
 
04:41:48.788 --> 04:41:48.798 align:start position:0%
Efficiency funds for electric
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles representative Ms I think has
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
an amendment right so let's take a look
 
04:41:54.878 --> 04:41:56.470 align:start position:0%
an amendment right so let's take a look
at

04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
that and then we're going to have to
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
quickly

04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:16.910 --> 04:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
would you like me to speak to
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
it yes please okay um so this
 
04:42:26.750 --> 04:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment is the um kind of the
 
04:42:28.030 --> 04:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
official version of what I had
 
04:42:28.040 --> 04:42:29.150 align:start position:0%
official version of what I had
circulated

04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
circulated
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and what this amendment
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
does is attempts to uh Place some
 
04:42:40.350 --> 04:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines and guard rails around the
 
04:42:42.750 --> 04:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
program that we discussed in the uh
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
hearing when the bill was
 
04:42:48.030 --> 04:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
introduced um as as the bill is
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
currently structured all it does is talk
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
about a $3 million program to be
 
04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
administered by Doe or and and instructs
 
04:42:59.430 --> 04:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
doe to create a pilot program what this
 
04:43:02.350 --> 04:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
amendment does is specifies what that
 
04:43:05.070 --> 04:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
pilot program would look like
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
um one of the significant changes that
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
has been made uh there are a couple
 
04:43:13.948 --> 04:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
significant changes one of them is that
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
rather than have doe administer the
 
04:43:22.270 --> 04:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
program um we um are recommending that
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
be the administrator of the program
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
which was um a great surprise to the
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Department of
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration who are with us
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
here today
 
04:43:38.830 --> 04:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
um and the the rationale behind that was
 
04:43:42.510 --> 04:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
that um Dr is in the business of sending
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
out checks to people uh in terms of you
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
know tax refunds Etc so it felt we felt
 
04:43:51.150 --> 04:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
like they would have the um at least if
 
04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
not the infrastructure of the mindset to
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
be able to uh administer a program like
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
this the other significant program is uh
 
04:44:01.990 --> 04:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
change is that um I can't I can't
 
04:44:03.628 --> 04:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
remember representative MC Williams when
 
04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
the original effect date was but we
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
decided to push it out to July 1st of
 
04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
2025 to give the Department of Revenue
 
04:44:13.750 --> 04:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
Administration some time to get the
 
04:44:15.670 --> 04:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
program uh
 
04:44:17.708 --> 04:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
organized uh it would be a two-year
 
04:44:20.270 --> 04:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
program $1.5 million doll each each of
 
04:44:22.628 --> 04:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
the two years the department would be
 
04:44:25.868 --> 04:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
able to deduct from that 1.5 million any
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
administrative costs associated with the
 
04:44:30.030 --> 04:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
program at the end of the two-year
 
04:44:33.708 --> 04:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
program they would be um requested to um
 
04:44:37.230 --> 04:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
submit a report report to um the house
 
04:44:38.830 --> 04:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee and the senate committee so
 
04:44:40.270 --> 04:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
that we could evaluate whether it made
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
sense moving forward um in terms of the
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
actual specifics of the
 
04:44:50.868 --> 04:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
program um it it follows um it follows
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines in terms of what kinds of
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles would be Avail would be
 
04:45:01.470 --> 04:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
eligible um the eligible Vehicles would
 
04:45:03.990 --> 04:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
be um pickup trucks sport utility
 
04:45:07.430 --> 04:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles and vans up that cost up to
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
$80,000 and uh $50,000 for all other
 
04:45:15.550 --> 04:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
eligible Vehicles cars Etc um there
 
04:45:19.590 --> 04:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
would be a um incentive payment
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
available for of $2,000 for battery
 
04:45:22.920 --> 04:45:23.910 align:start position:0%
available for of $2,000 for battery
electric

04:45:23.910 --> 04:45:23.920 align:start position:0%

vehicles and 1,000 for a plug-in hybrid
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh and that would be available
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
on both used and new cars uh it would be
 
04:45:38.390 --> 04:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
um anyone any New Hampshire resident
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
with a new with a New Hampshire driver's
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%

eligible for one incentive payment per
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle per
 
04:45:51.670 --> 04:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
year um and there is a income test that
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the federal
 
04:45:55.948 --> 04:45:55.958 align:start position:0%
guidelines um 300,000 for a married
 
04:45:58.270 --> 04:45:58.280 align:start position:0%

150 for other
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
filers the program would be set up in
 
04:46:06.390 --> 04:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
such a way that um the rebate would be
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
offered to the individual at the
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
dealership and the individual would then
 
04:46:12.788 --> 04:46:12.798 align:start position:0%
have the ability to decide whether they
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
wanted to receive the rebate themselves
 
04:46:16.628 --> 04:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
or assign it transfer it to the
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
dealership and then the dealer would
 
04:46:21.270 --> 04:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
take it off the the sticker
 
04:46:21.280 --> 04:46:23.470 align:start position:0%
take it off the the sticker

Williams uh thank you chair Bose just to
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
follow up on the conversation we had
 
05:05:20.948 --> 05:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
during our work session um I did put in
 
05:05:25.070 --> 05:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
a request to OS to do a um Amendment for
 
05:05:27.030 --> 05:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
a moratorium for two years to give us
 
05:05:31.628 --> 05:05:31.638 align:start position:0%
more time to get information on um first
 
05:05:32.990 --> 05:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
what has been requested requested since
 
05:05:35.788 --> 05:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
1985 from the executive Council and uh
 
05:05:38.948 --> 05:05:38.958 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and second uh is
 
05:05:40.548 --> 05:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
there more information that we need in
 
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
order to make a decision whether or not
 
05:05:43.868 --> 05:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this I just feel as
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
though we're looking for more data uh so
 
05:05:47.910 --> 05:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
I think an amendment for a moratorium
 
05:05:50.070 --> 05:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
could give us more time to get more data
 
05:05:51.788 --> 05:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
uh that being said I I respect the
 
05:05:53.430 --> 05:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
committee's decision on how we end up on
 
05:05:54.868 --> 05:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
this I just wanted to give everyone an
 
05:05:57.510 --> 05:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
update thank you thank you
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams if the itl
 
05:06:01.628 --> 05:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
motion should fail maybe we'll consider
 
05:06:03.788 --> 05:06:03.798 align:start position:0%
your potential Amendment Is there
 
05:06:03.798 --> 05:06:04.830 align:start position:0%
your potential Amendment Is there
further

05:06:04.830 --> 05:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:06:07.070 --> 05:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Vice chair
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh in terms of my it motion uh we
 
05:06:12.430 --> 05:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
just discuss the fact that there are a
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
lot of uncertainties uh the bill as as
 
05:06:17.310 --> 05:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
was originally submitted uh was
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
completely unworkable amendments seem to
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
try to address part of it but there was
 
05:06:22.320 --> 05:06:23.030 align:start position:0%
try to address part of it but there was
still

05:06:23.030 --> 05:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
still
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
uncertainty uh we think that you know if
 
05:06:27.948 --> 05:06:27.958 align:start position:0%
if something else can come up it should
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
be in a new bill the following year uh
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so therefore um uh itl I think it's
 
05:06:35.590 --> 05:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
the appropriate motion for this
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:42.708 --> 05:06:42.718 align:start position:0%

anyone

anyone
 
05:08:26.830 --> 05:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
leaves or at least before
 
05:08:31.190 --> 05:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
clarification is the end of the day uh
 
05:08:31.200 --> 05:08:34.190 align:start position:0%
clarification is the end of the day uh
1159

05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
1159
 
05:08:38.830 --> 05:08:38.840 align:start position:0%
just asking 449 44 we've been instructed
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
by house committee services to try to
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
leave this building by 5:00 every
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon because the employees who work
 
05:08:51.430 --> 05:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
here have to stay until we leave
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
so from this point forward let's
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
consider five o'l to be the end of the
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
day and uh but for the purposes of
 
05:09:04.510 --> 05:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
submitting a majority or a Minority
 
05:09:07.110 --> 05:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
Report you you stay if you're assigned
 
05:09:09.150 --> 05:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
to do that you stay here until you
 
05:09:11.350 --> 05:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
finish writing it and hand it to me I
 
05:09:13.948 --> 05:09:13.958 align:start position:0%
stay here until I get it from you then
 
05:09:16.230 --> 05:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
we can all leave
 
05:09:18.948 --> 05:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
okay all right so with that we'll close
 
05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
the exact session on House Bill 1700
 
05:09:27.548 --> 05:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
FN now I will open an exact session ex
 
05:09:30.948 --> 05:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
05:09:34.868 --> 05:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
1036 and and given the fact that we had
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
a relatively robust discussion about
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
this Legislation during the work session
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that further work is
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
needed and so I'm going to
 
05:09:50.670 --> 05:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
recess the exec session on House Bill
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
1036 until a future date so that more
 
05:09:57.868 --> 05:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
work can be done on this bill so with
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
that I will close the exec session on
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1036 Recess Recess Recess
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
recessed I'm sorry not closed
 
05:10:10.548 --> 05:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
recessed my
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
mistake now we can open a exec session
 
05:10:16.788 --> 05:10:16.798 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1078 relative to first
 
05:10:18.990 --> 05:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
responder organization access to
 
05:10:22.470 --> 05:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.480 --> 05:10:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
collocation

05:10:27.990 --> 05:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh need to fix the fix we need to fix
 
05:10:34.430 --> 05:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
the Amendment as we discussed during the
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
course of the EXE the work session and I
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
don't think we can get that done today
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
so I think it's probably going to be
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
necessary to recess this executive
 
05:10:46.990 --> 05:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
session as
 
05:10:51.030 --> 05:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
well until we can get a modified version
 
05:10:51.040 --> 05:10:52.270 align:start position:0%
well until we can get a modified version
of

05:10:52.270 --> 05:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:10:52.280 --> 05:10:54.030 align:start position:0%
of
this

05:10:54.030 --> 05:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:10:54.040 --> 05:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
this
amendment

05:10:55.750 --> 05:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
so I recess the exec session on
 
05:11:04.030 --> 05:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
1078 now I'll open an exact session on
 
05:11:07.470 --> 05:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1465 FN relative to studies
 
05:11:10.628 --> 05:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
of nuclear energy Energy Technologies
 
05:11:13.470 --> 05:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
and as we had discussed earlier today
 
05:11:15.868 --> 05:11:15.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to recess this one as well
 
05:11:17.788 --> 05:11:17.798 align:start position:0%
because representative Harrington and
 
05:11:20.430 --> 05:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
representative muns are working on a an
 
05:11:22.190 --> 05:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Harrington
 
05:11:23.910 --> 05:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
could you give us a brief outline of the
 
05:11:26.190 --> 05:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
amendment you guys are going to well the
 
05:11:27.910 --> 05:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
one of the problems was the uh the
 
05:11:30.510 --> 05:11:30.520 align:start position:0%
original bill was very very encompassing
 
05:11:33.030 --> 05:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
and sort of misin interpreted so we had
 
05:11:36.390 --> 05:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note I think of over $120,000
 
05:11:38.030 --> 05:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
for new employees and that was never the
 
05:11:40.590 --> 05:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
intent here so we've been uh looking
 
05:11:42.548 --> 05:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
with the with working with the
 
05:11:45.190 --> 05:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
Department of energy on this and we're
 
05:11:46.548 --> 05:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
going to try to come up with a position
 
05:11:48.430 --> 05:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
that'll be like a nuclear coordinator
 
05:11:50.910 --> 05:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
possibly uh in the combin it with the
 
05:11:52.628 --> 05:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
office of offshore wind there's already
 
05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
an established position there this will
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
allow somebody that's interested in
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
contacting the state of New Hampshire
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
and finding out about the status of
 
05:12:02.470 --> 05:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
whatever anything nuclear is contact
 
05:12:04.948 --> 05:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
person uh it'll also go ahead and clean
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
up the um bill of the or the leg
 
05:12:09.990 --> 05:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislation that talks about atomic
 
05:12:12.070 --> 05:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
energy commission and not NRC and a few
 
05:12:14.910 --> 05:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
things like that and establishing that
 
05:12:16.430 --> 05:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
position is one of the recommendations
 
05:12:18.990 --> 05:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
out of the uh nuclear task for
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
commission that was just published if
 
05:12:22.750 --> 05:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see I think it's I don't it's on
 
05:12:25.548 --> 05:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
page 49 and it's option six or something
 
05:12:26.948 --> 05:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
to establish that so we'd be
 
05:12:28.750 --> 05:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
implementing that and I think it's a
 
05:12:30.990 --> 05:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
good first step in the right direction
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
uh without spending a lot of extra money
 
05:12:34.510 --> 05:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
that really wouldn't accomplish
 
05:12:38.708 --> 05:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
anything Mr chair representative Ms yeah
 
05:12:40.270 --> 05:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
and if if I could just add to that I
 
05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
mean I I think every I agree with
 
05:12:42.628 --> 05:12:42.638 align:start position:0%
everything that representative
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington has said I mean I think what
 
05:12:47.030 --> 05:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
what I am also hoping we can do is is
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
clarify you know the reporting
 
05:12:51.390 --> 05:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
requirements instead of having um
 
05:12:54.670 --> 05:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
multiple state agencies reporting on on
 
05:12:57.990 --> 05:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
nuclear activities have this coordinator
 
05:13:00.350 --> 05:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
of nuclear policy be the one that's
 
05:13:01.788 --> 05:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
responsible for producing that report
 
05:13:05.470 --> 05:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
report and seeking input where
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
needed representative McGee there was
 
05:13:10.548 --> 05:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
some there was some discussion this is
 
05:13:12.230 --> 05:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
for you two guys there was some
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about uh figuring out which
 
05:13:19.150 --> 05:13:19.160 align:start position:0%
pieces of 1644 might also be
 
05:13:20.868 --> 05:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
incorporated in they were both on the
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
topic of nuclear are you guys reviewing
 
05:13:24.750 --> 05:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
that or are you just doing something
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
separate I'm just of STI we have okay I
 
05:13:30.030 --> 05:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
thought the chair had said something I
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
had requested that we consider doing
 
05:13:35.070 --> 05:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
doing that um and I and you know I
 
05:13:35.990 --> 05:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
hadn't had a chance to talk to
 
05:13:37.310 --> 05:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative heritton about this but I
 
05:13:38.788 --> 05:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
did talk with representative Vose and I
 
05:13:42.190 --> 05:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
think my my thinking was that as part of
 
05:13:44.590 --> 05:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
that coordinator's responsibilities to
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
to to report they could potentially
 
05:13:49.868 --> 05:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
report on the things that representative
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
hering uh representative Vose was
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
interested in in
 
05:13:56.990 --> 05:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
1465 yeah we can what if you just are we
 
05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:00.680 --> 05:14:02.310 align:start position:0%
 
row

05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
row
 
05:14:05.230 --> 05:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
all right consider it when request made
 
05:14:05.240 --> 05:14:06.670 align:start position:0%
all right consider it when request made
thank

05:14:06.670 --> 05:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:14:10.590 --> 05:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you both any further
 
05:14:11.948 --> 05:14:11.958 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
05:14:16.230 --> 05:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
this seeing none I will recess the the
 
05:14:21.548 --> 05:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
exec session on House Bill 1465
 
05:14:25.350 --> 05:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
FN and then I will open an ex exact
 
05:14:29.590 --> 05:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 1472 FN relative
 
05:14:31.948 --> 05:14:31.958 align:start position:0%
to relative to rebates of Energy
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
Efficiency funds for electric vehicles
 
05:14:37.350 --> 05:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
and we're also going to recess this one
 
05:14:39.190 --> 05:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
and we're going to recess this one for
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
the simple uh matter simple reason that
 
05:14:47.070 --> 05:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have a sufficient uh attendance
 
05:14:49.948 --> 05:14:49.958 align:start position:0%
here to support going forward with the
 
05:14:51.430 --> 05:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
full exec
 
05:14:53.788 --> 05:14:53.798 align:start position:0%
session but we do have a nice uh
 
05:14:56.230 --> 05:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to consider now so we will go
 
05:14:59.310 --> 05:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
forward with that at a future date uh as
 
05:15:03.510 --> 05:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
well so
 
05:15:07.830 --> 05:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
we will recess House Bill 1472 FN and
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
that concludes our work for CH we excuse
 
05:15:13.510 --> 05:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
me we we have we have one missing member
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
and we're in an executive session so
 
05:15:18.110 --> 05:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
we're we're not going to be able to vote
 
05:15:19.948 --> 05:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
well the rules of the house say that
 
05:15:22.708 --> 05:15:22.718 align:start position:0%
when a member is absent yeah that you're
 
05:15:25.470 --> 05:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to replace said member provided
 
05:15:28.270 --> 05:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
that he notifies you 25 24 hours in
 
05:15:31.628 --> 05:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
advance of his absence and we learned an
 
05:15:33.510 --> 05:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
hour ago that our member was not going
 
05:15:35.470 --> 05:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to be here so we couldn't
 
05:15:39.548 --> 05:15:39.558 align:start position:0%
arrange for a substitute and it is the
 
05:15:43.470 --> 05:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
perogative of the chair to uh recess an
 
05:15:46.190 --> 05:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
exact session at any time and so that's
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
what I've decided to
 
05:15:53.548 --> 05:15:53.558 align:start position:0%
do I guess I point point of order yes
 
05:15:53.558 --> 05:15:56.030 align:start position:0%
do I guess I point point of order yes
representative

05:15:56.030 --> 05:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:57.990 --> 05:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
question I guess what I'm struggling
 
05:15:59.910 --> 05:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
with is that we did vote on a pre on
 
05:16:02.190 --> 05:16:02.200 align:start position:0%
another bill in the same execu session
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
where the individual was
 
05:16:08.590 --> 05:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:11.310 --> 05:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
inconsistent not as far as I'm concerned
 
05:16:15.230 --> 05:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
an executive s is a finite uh session on
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.440 --> 05:16:24.150 align:start position:0%
 
bill

05:16:24.150 --> 05:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:16:27.310 --> 05:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
so we will meet again next week but I
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
think we're only going to meet on
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we have completed all our public
 
05:16:34.830 --> 05:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
hearings so the work we have left to do
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
is work sessions and executive sessions
 
05:16:40.750 --> 05:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
so I think we can cut down to one day a
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
week from
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
here going forward until we finish all
 
05:16:48.548 --> 05:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
our work what time do we meet on
 
05:16:53.350 --> 05:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
Tuesday next Tuesday we can start at 9:
 
05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
the following Tuesday we'll have to wait
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
until 10: every other Tuesday there's a
 
05:17:01.708 --> 05:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
meeting in this room at from 9:00 to 10:
 
05:17:03.788 --> 05:17:03.798 align:start position:0%
uh we ran into that issue this morning
 
05:17:07.150 --> 05:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
and we'll run into it again in two weeks
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
so consider next Tuesday to to be a 9:00
 
05:17:14.190 --> 05:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
start for work session and exec session
 
05:17:16.628 --> 05:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
and the following Tuesday a 10:00 start
 
05:17:19.910 --> 05:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
for work session and exec session and
 
05:17:22.150 --> 05:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
with that we're done for today safe ride
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:30.400 --> 05:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
Thursday
