Waters
 
00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
that's what two T's can
 
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay we're looking at we have a side by
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
side presented from the researcher for
 
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.270 align:start position:0%
side presented from the researcher for
uh

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
the two versions of the bill that we're
 
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
meeting on
 
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.210 align:start position:0%
meeting on
and

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 align:start position:0%
there's quite a difference
 
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
both in
 
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
the house version was two million five
 
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
and it did not lapse the Senate version
 
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
is 500 000 and it does lapse at the end
 
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
of the biennium
 
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
that anybody wants to suggest Senator
 
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.129 align:start position:0%
that anybody wants to suggest Senator
Pearl

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 align:start position:0%
Pearl
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you um when we were when we had
 
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
this bill in finance I had spoken with
 
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsor about the reduction
 
00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
down to five hundred thousand dollars
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
and he was fine with that at the time
 
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is what he'd like us
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
to change is make it non-lapsing and I
 
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
guess I would propose that if the house
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
members would be willing to come to that
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
come to the 500 000 and make it
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing I think the Senate would be
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman uh as you may recall
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
this came out of the full finance
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee initially of not to pass at
 
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
all because there was some concern that
 
00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
we do have another fund the water fund
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
many many many millions of dollars in
 
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
and there's a feeling among division one
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
that recommended to the full finance
 
00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.570 align:start position:0%
that recommended to the full finance
committee

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
that we not pass the legislation it did
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
pass on the house floor the finance
 
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
committee decision was overturned by
 
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
about five votes so there's a little
 
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
history there that uh
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm not in a good place or recommend
 
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
anything at this point because after our
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
review and full Finance it was a concern
 
00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
that we were adding another fund that
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
already had a fund to support
 
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.930 align:start position:0%
already had a fund to support
groundwater

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.529 align:start position:0%
 
issues

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
also the
 
00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:33.370 align:start position:0%
also the
the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
22 million 500 000 it's 500 it's a five
 
00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:38.689 align:start position:0%
22 million 500 000 it's 500 it's a five
mil

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
mil
 
00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
because it went uh two and a half each
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
year each year okay so that is that is a
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
that's Senator Waters thank you I serve
 
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
on the groundwater
 
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
um one I don't know if others do here as
 
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
well but
 
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
um it it is difficult for that fund and
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that it can cover the kinds
 
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 align:start position:0%
of situations that are addressed here
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
particularly about private Wells and
 
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
drought for Agri for agricultural
 
00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139 align:start position:0%
purposes so that's why the Senate looked
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
favorably on it because
 
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
um you know serving on that committee I
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
I can see the argument that we need
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
something to address this kind of
 
00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
particular circumstances and the Senate
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
go in to take this out of the 23.
 
00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:28.730 align:start position:0%
go in to take this out of the 23.
um

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
budget so that we were not reopening the
 
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
current budget and that we've found as
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl said that there was the
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand dollars to support
 
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
that in the 23 budget and so that's why
 
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
we came to where we were in terms of the
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
question that representative leishman
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
raised and the source of the funding
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.589 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.629 align:start position:0%
 
represent

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative Vale
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.270 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
so for me
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
coming from the policy committee which
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
is resources Recreation and development
 
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
this is a humble sum of money however
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
I would be fine with making this a
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund and that's more
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
important to me than the appropriation
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
for many reasons one of which we heard
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
in testimony that the groundwater trust
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
fund is accepting applications that are
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
piecemeal for smaller projects that
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
they're not as prepared for and they
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
requested this Fund in order to be able
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
to address the wells running dry and
 
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
Wells that aren't working due to flood
 
00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.230 align:start position:0%
Wells that aren't working due to flood
conditions

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:57.790 align:start position:0%
Etc so for the for the committee
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.290 align:start position:0%
Etc so for the for the committee
[Music]

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
for my position is really that we remove
 
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
the which under on page three at the top
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
shall not lapse until June 30th
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
in my mind it would say shall not lapse
 
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you so much in other words
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing Forever non-lapsing at least
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
until there's any kind of legislation
 
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
legislation that breaks um this kind of
 
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
funding up so that we are addressing the
 
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
people that need it the most which is
 
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
homeowners that are taxpayers in every
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
town in in New Hampshire
 
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
my feeling was looking at what we've
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
done with the side by side even but this
 
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
needs new legislation
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't cover what I think we
 
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.570 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't cover what I think we
all

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.130 align:start position:0%
all
wanted

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
collectively uh
 
00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
both as Senator Waters said that that
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
committee he serves on
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
would like more money to to get some
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
things done
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
most of this money would come in a
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
disaster which is
 
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
something that comes along a little
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
later when we see available money and
 
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:20.540 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not it's available without
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
legislation very specifically what I was
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
um looking at it I thought there were a
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
lot of loose ends it it says poor people
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
or low-income people who are they they
 
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:35.700 align:start position:0%
should be defined uh you're going to
 
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
leave all this up to rule making
 
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.810 align:start position:0%
leave all this up to rule making
um

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what I I thought that
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
this needed new legislation rather than
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
what's here
 
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm
 
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not ready to move on with this
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
at least that's my opinion I think
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.329 --> 00:11:02.339 align:start position:0%
incomplete things that I think it needs
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
a new bill that could come next year
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
because since we're not under any
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
emergency now
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
the haste to have this passed it's not
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
not there in my mind
 
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I may
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
we're not really here to have a policy
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
discussion at this point we're here to
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
discuss the differences between the two
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
bills right I understand there may be
 
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
some tension about the policy in general
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
but it did pass the house
 
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
the uh the real thing that we're here to
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
discuss is the money and the and the
 
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
effective date and you know in the
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
things that are in the last two
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
paragraphs at least that's my
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we should really
 
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
be having a conversation here about
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
I guess is there an objection from the
 
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
house to the
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
moving down to the 500 000 from the 2.5
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
and the date change that's really what
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.410 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
you've been affected it's not in the
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
budget by taking it out of 2023. if you
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
haven't really included it in the 24-25
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the funds that would have been in
 
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.389 align:start position:0%
of the funds that would have been in
that

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
so it's a big change from
 
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
from what we did in the house
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
which is difficult to swallow
 
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.569 align:start position:0%
which is difficult to swallow
so

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh if this if we if we remove the
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
if we if we change it back to a
 
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
non-lapse that means that money stays
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
there forever right or except for
 
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
that instance uh well that first you
 
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:53.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
well I think
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
disaster in order to go for that amount
 
00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.100 align:start position:0%
of money right or to go for that small
 
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
amount of and but also it says that the
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh the Des has access to that money to
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
itself well if it sits there for a
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
certain length of time
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:46.700 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is a direct giveaway
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
yeah it was funding uh there's in most
 
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:56.459 align:start position:0%
of the time you see in these type of
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
issues around Mountain loans things to
 
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.060 align:start position:0%
be able to get people give people a
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
skin in the game
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
and SEC and also it it didn't come up
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
and it'll take responsibility for that
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
during uh the house discussions
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
uh issues around well the wells that
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
were that in the previous attempt at
 
00:14:33.009 --> 00:14:33.019 align:start position:0%
doing this uh
 
00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
they they were
 
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
they had this there were people going to
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
Des and getting Wells done were these
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh Doug Wells
 
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
which are fairly inexpensive
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
were they changed were they were they
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
were they changed to drilled Wells uh
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
uh that are not inexpensive right uh so
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's a big big difference and because
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
and also in Doug Wells tend to tend to
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
go dry all in in the summit
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
uh whereas to drilled Wells are not Mr
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
chair do you mind if we could just
 
00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:22.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
is this your office okay absolutely
 
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:10.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you and uh it uh we're probably
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
gonna just hold to our the Senate
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
position which I know is not agreeable
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
to you folks so could we at least get a
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
commitment to the next session that we
 
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
could work on this issue
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that within his committee that
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
will be and it'll come to division one
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
but I think on this bill we agree to
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
disagree okay yeah
 
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.070 align:start position:0%
disagree okay yeah
but

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
in an agreeable manner in an agreeable
 
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.810 align:start position:0%
in an agreeable manner in an agreeable
manner

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
manner
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
because we see it as an area that
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps can need some legislation but
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
not what we see before us all right well
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to work with you next
 
00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.570 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to work with you next
session

00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
always thank you
