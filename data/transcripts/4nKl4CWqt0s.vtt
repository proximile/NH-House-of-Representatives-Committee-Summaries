haven't really included it in the 24-25
 

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.310 align:start position:0%
haven't really included it in the 24-25

that
 

00:12:11.399 --> 00:12:15.410 align:start position:0%
that

so it's a big change from
 

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.930 align:start position:0%
so it's a big change from
