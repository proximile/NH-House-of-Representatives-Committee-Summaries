10:05 uh I would
 
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.390 align:start position:0%
10:05 uh I would
ask

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
representative sellers to lead us in the
 
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
practicing pledge aliance to the flag of
 
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
the United States of America and to the
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
justice for
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
you so a couple of quick announcements
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
um one is on the exec session that is uh
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 1:00 um due to a number
 
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
of of circumstances most of which had to
 
00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
do with um the availability of of
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendments that have been promised and
 
00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
or working on and not received as yet um
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
foro the exec session this
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon I thought they would be wild
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
Applause with that but I'll keep going
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you it's a
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
little nut late now um so that would
 
00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
mean that we have three hearings this
 
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
morning and then um we will move the
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
exec session um
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
virtually in its entirety as I look at
 
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
it quickly um to the 14th next week next
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um and and then once we do
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
that if we include the bills that we're
 
00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.150 align:start position:0%
that if we include the bills that we're
hearing

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
today that would mean we only would have
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
one additional bill which is the
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory Bill and then
 
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
we're done for this uh for the house
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
bills um we would be then done um
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
through March 14th when crossover and
 
00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 align:start position:0%
then we go from there y rep
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
payer yes okay so the Whole World Hears
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
what you say thank you is it possible
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
that we could do the executive session
 
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
on the 14th starting at 9:00
 
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.749 align:start position:0%
on the 14th starting at 9:00
am

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I will take that under advisement um
 
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
people um well um is how's how do those
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
well we usually have been doing them in
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
the afternoon um but
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
but I don't I don't know of any reason I
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
think there are actually a couple people
 
00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
in your caucus that have difficulty for
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
nine or maybe even 10 that's what I was
 
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
thinking um and I'm not sure we
 
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
generally don't have a great deal of
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
discussion so I don't think it would be
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
I'll work this all through I I but I'm
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly happy to fit in with
 
00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
whatever we're doing um so I'll leave it
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
up to representative she and Mr chair
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
that was moving the exec session from
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
the afternoon to the morning I didn't
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
hear you uh yeah for we and we haven't
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
put it in the calendar as yet for the
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
14th okay um that'd be great actually we
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
should do that by noon time
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
today all right
 
00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:24.039 align:start position:0%
um great suggestion great Point um let's
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh move from there um we have
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
three hearings today um and that almost
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
that does eliminate all of the hearings
 
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
we have on our house bills um and even
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
those are kind of uh um just uh partly
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
discussion today as uh as hearings uh
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
there will be additional information
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
coming on I think all of them um that
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
being said um I will open the hearing on
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:09.320 align:start position:0%

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%

00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
yourself for the for the
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
YouTube I'm representative Vanessa Shen
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
and I represent Hillsburg 43 the town of
 
00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
Milford um HB
 
00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:06.190 align:start position:0%
Milford um HB
1030

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
1030
 
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
um I uh drafted this bill um basically
 
00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
as a placeholder bill um as you know um
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative wall and I were appointed
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
to the special committee on commissions
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
by the speaker to uh look through
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
commissions that um are no longer needed
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
um and so um if you remember a couple
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
months ago we um passed s sp84
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
unanimously out of this committee with
 
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
um we replaced all of the original
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
language of s sp84 uh with amendments
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
that would um Sunset some of the
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
Committees that we found were inactive
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
um in that special committee on
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
commissions as well as a a couple other
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
amendments that we were asked to place
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the bill by legislative
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
Services um and that sb84 passed our
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
house and is now in the other body
 
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
waiting to be acted on and it hasn't yet
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
so we would like to um draft an
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
amendment um to 10:30 replacing all with
 
00:11:22.269 --> 00:11:22.279 align:start position:0%
the same language we just passed s sp84
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
with all of that language being um put
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
into 10:30 passing it again out of the
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
house sending it over to the other body
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
just in
 
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
case um so that's the plan with um HP
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
1030 and I'd be happy to take
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um are there
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
questions I I can I can help explain
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
some of the process maybe for um our
 
00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
newer members so um SB
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
84 when the house um amended
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
sb84 um we send it back um amended and
 
00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
and the Senate has the option of
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
concurring non-c concurring or um asking
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
for a committee of
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
conference they take those up as house
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
messages that come to the Senate um as
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
yet they have not taken up that message
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
um so we really don't know um and I'm to
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
be honest I'm not sure completely of
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
Senate rules uh they may have the
 
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
ability within their rules um to not
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
take it up at all and and in that case
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
it would die on the table
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
um by doing the process that
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
representative Sheen mentions by loading
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
it onto or the language onto this house
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
bill on in and passing it in the Full
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
House it would then go over during
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
crossover as a as a house bill and it
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
would have to be assigned to one of the
 
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
Senate committees so it would actually
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
Force getting a hearing um in the Senate
 
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
where where the other process um it may
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
not get that that attention so that
 
00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully um alleviates some of the
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
questions you have but if there are
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none I think you're
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hobson thank you for taking my question
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little confused as to why oh
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm confused as to why it wouldn't
 
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:47.320 align:start position:0%
be taken up by the other body if we sent
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
it over
 
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:52.759 align:start position:0%
there do do you know what I'm saying
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
what I don't know what their reasonings
 
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.269 align:start position:0%
what I don't know what their reasonings
would

00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%

1388 um it may
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
familiar to you because it is the bill
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
that um we put forth last uh
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
January as a retain bill um to House
 
00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.069 align:start position:0%
January as a retain bill um to House
Bill

00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
301 um in in in its entirety
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
um what I'm proposing to you or let me
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
just back up a second the reason um that
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 301 was tabled um in January
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
was at my request
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
um we had had conversations with members
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the Ethics Committee about House Bill
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
301 and they pointed out some very good
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
things uh that that they were
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with Andor language that
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
they would like to have changed so at
 
00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
that time we had one of two options we
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
could have um passed House Bill
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
301 and um worked on an amendment that
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
would be brought to the Senate um Andor
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
we could have worked on a fast Amendment
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
and brought it to the floor as a floor
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment um in the
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
house it was our judgment um that that
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a conversation um on something
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
is important as um our our ethics um
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines and laws was too important to
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
try to have a conversation on the floor
 
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
of the house um and we also recognized
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
that we had the opportunity because
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration was holding
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 1388 we had the ability to
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
amend House Bill
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
1388 in any way we we wanted and bring
 
00:37:26.309 --> 00:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
the actual bill after it passes the
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
house floor to the senate in a um in a
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
joint venture with the house house
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee so that was the route
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
we took um we we tabled House Bill 301
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
and then we um sat back down with the
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee people and um one of
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
which is on our committee um now and um
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
and we hammered out U where differences
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
were were uh we talked about language um
 
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that we were um
 
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.950 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that we were um
working

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
in pretty similar lines we just had
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
different ways of getting to the to the
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
same spot so what you have in front of
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
you right
 
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
now um are two options and I've labeled
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
them purposely um option A and option b
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
without um anyone knowing except for for
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
me um which is which and what I would
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
ask the committee is for them to um or
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
for you to um consider the two of them
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
and decide which of those would be um
 
00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
more understandable more readable more
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
um more given the ability to follow um
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
by your colleagues and yourselves
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
so um we will not uh my understanding is
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
we will not be executing that bill today
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
um and so this would be something that
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
you can uh Ponder or consider for the
 
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
next week or so um and and one of these
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
these both these options you'll notice
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
they're not in the form of amendments as
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
yet they will be converted to amendments
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
and brought back to the committee uh
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
prior to the executive session so any
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
changes uh that you see um can be made
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
prior to going for amendments um but I
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
should just point out um the really the
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
two areas that
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh that are different um and one
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
is the idea um
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
of including um the the phrase or the
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
two words special interest interest
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
um special interest is a um well
 
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
um is defined in our current ethics book
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
and um it means according to this
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
definition here any Financial or
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
non-financial personal
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
interest um and it's under the
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
definition of conflict of interest so a
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest is a special
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
interest and it means any Financial or
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
non-financial personal interest that's
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
what one option A has option b simply
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
goes from
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
um conflict of interest definition and
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
says a conflict of interest means any
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
Financial or non-financial personal
 
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
interest so it it deletes the phrase
 
00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
special interest
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
entirely the only other change or the
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
only other um point of difference is
 
00:41:04.589 --> 00:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
um I have to find it um in the
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions for recusal for conflict of
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
interest um and it's a percentage change
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
so one of them requires that if a
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
legislator or the legislator's household
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
members ownership of
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
Securities um is um less than
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
1% than you're exempt the other says if
 
00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
1% than you're exempt the other says if
it's

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
5% you're exempt um and the reason that
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
those to exist is
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
um you know all of us I think it's fair
 
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
to say hold some kind of um um
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
retirement income whether it's in a
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
Company pension whether it's in our own
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
mutual funds whether it's on our own
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
IRAs anything like that um it was and
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
this didn't exist by the way in our um
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill 301 the original one so this
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that we held that
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
up for purposely but the question is at
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
what level does that um do you need to
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
own some percentage of um of the
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
outstanding shares of a mutual fund or
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
of an underlying company um before you
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
would um it would be subject to a
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
conflict of Interest gets a little
 
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.309 align:start position:0%
conflict of Interest gets a little
technical

00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
technical
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
um that's but that's really the only two
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
differences between option A and option
 
00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:38.270 align:start position:0%
differences between option A and option
b

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
b
 
00:42:40.589 --> 00:42:40.599 align:start position:0%
um I think with that I'll end my
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm happy to answer any
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions um that may come up but
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
certainly um I want to make sure
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
everyone understands that uh this is
 
00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.470 align:start position:0%
everyone understands that uh this is
only

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
um sections three and four
 
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.829 align:start position:0%
um sections three and four
um

00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
of of multi-art um P section in your in
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
your booklet um but these are the only
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
places that this bill is dealing with
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
and uh and these are the only places
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
that there were differences between what
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
the health Ethics Committee wanted and
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
what um I as a representative of the
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration wanted so
 
00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
just that's where it
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you madam chair um my
 
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
question is option A and option b and
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can even ask this
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
question of you but I'm going to ask it
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
and you can just say no do you prefer
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
one or the
 
00:43:51.359 --> 00:43:53.870 align:start position:0%
one or the
other

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
um no I don't um they do I I would be
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
happy with either um and that was the
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
interesting part and I'm happy to that
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
you asked the question
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
um as much as it pained me to table
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:44:21.309 --> 00:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
301 um because it was presented to me
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
that there were wide differences with
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
with how the Ethics Committee was
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
301 and then once we tabled it and we
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
sat down and hammered out line by line
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
turned out we were very close um and I
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
think that surprised the Ethics
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
Committee people as much as it did me um
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
or maybe more so so um so at this point
 
00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:53.079 align:start position:0%
I really don't have a preference
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
um I think and I agree with the original
 
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
sponsors of 301 and the prior two
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
iterations before that that came from
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
the chair of Ethics Committee um this is
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
we've not had recusal in our guidelines
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
prior to this and um I think it's fair
 
00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
to say we have all seen circumstances
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
where that make it imperative that we do
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
address so um both of these will
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish that
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
longwinded answer to saying yes
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question does this um I I
 
00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
obviously don't have hb31 in its
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
entirety in front of me but does this uh
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
eliminate the uh ability for someone to
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
just declare their intent to
 
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
vote on a particular issue
 
00:45:59.790 --> 00:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
anyway they this is this is this saying
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
that they must recuse regardless of um
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
their intent being noticed I'm not sure
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
I understand that process sure um so
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
this is only
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
dealing this is only dealing with those
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
with a conflict of interest um and this
 
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
is only dealing with conflicts of
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
interest when there is a either a
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
financial or
 
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
conflict if if you have those one of
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
those and they're clear clearly defined
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
which um which category it is either F
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
Financial or non-financial um it does
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
say shall so you shall
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
um um recuse in that case does that
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question okay thank you and
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
r mcarter um HB
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
1388 is the language of
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
hb31 so if you wanted to read the full
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh all the language it's right
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
questions rip Hopson yeah thank you
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
question it seems as if on option
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
b non-financial personal interest on the
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
back side
 
00:47:27.119 --> 00:47:28.549 align:start position:0%
back side
really

00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
outlines the me uh exists when a
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
legislator or household member has a
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the welfare of an
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
organization that's pretty
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
descriptive less uh more so than I feel
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
this has been in the past in other words
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
I think it outlines that there is a
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility there so am I reading
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
that right if it feels as if some things
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
that I might have questioned before are
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
are not a question now because I might
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
not be responsible for the welfare of an
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
organization do I have that
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you for your question um
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
first let me point out that that
 
00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
language is the same in both
 
00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
options um option A has it um on on the
 
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
second page on the back of that um at
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
right um and what it gets to um and I'm
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
kind of glad we didn't use the phrase
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility but but that's
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
what um that
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility is getting to um when
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
when you are part of an organization and
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
you have you're an officer or you have
 
00:48:59.470 --> 00:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
um responsibility for um the finances
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
the and that's what they're getting to
 
00:49:05.069 --> 00:49:05.079 align:start position:0%
with with welfare if you if you're more
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
than just a member of um you know the
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
Elks um not to pick on one organization
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
or another but if you are an officer of
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
the Elks you have direction of of how
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
the Elks
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
operate and that's what this is getting
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
to um it wouldn't be if you were just um
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
you know a card carrying member of
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh any
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
help I have a followup
 
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.630 align:start position:0%
help I have a followup
um

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
so uh responsibility for the
 
00:49:50.349 --> 00:49:50.359 align:start position:0%
welfare or welfare of an organization or
 
00:49:50.359 --> 00:49:51.950 align:start position:0%
welfare or welfare of an organization or
the

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
outcome is I'm trying to establish a
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
relationship between that term and
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
advocating it seems that there are two
 
00:50:03.839 --> 00:50:06.230 align:start position:0%
advocating it seems that there are two
different

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh definitions I guess two different
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
scenarios um so do I do I have that
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
right and yes we as Representatives um
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
occasionally have passions and things
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we advocate for but there that's
 
00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the welfare outcome
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
of a welfare for an organization that
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
boy did I mess that up but you get where
 
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
boy did I mess that up but you get where
I'm

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:34.010 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
I'm
[Laughter]

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
going yes you have that it it is it's
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
not um simply being a member the the the
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
point here in both is that
 
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
you're you're not uh you wouldn't have a
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
conflict simply being a member um you
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
would you would have to have more than
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
that level you would have to be um again
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
an officer uh or someone that deals with
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
the finances of that organization
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
something like that R
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
costable uh thank you madam chair and
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um I
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if you it was not the way I'm
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
reading that is that fiduciary I mean
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
fiduciary is in the it is in the
 
00:51:25.710 --> 00:51:25.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph the way I read it is the
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
welfare of the organization is tied to
 
00:51:30.549 --> 00:51:30.559 align:start position:0%
by virtue of holding a fiduciary
 
00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
position so if you have no fiduciary
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities then you're not covered
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
under non-financial interest am I
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
getting that correct yes you
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
are and you said it much better than I
 
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.829 align:start position:0%
are and you said it much better than I
did

00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
so R Pearson thank you thank you madam
 
00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:48.589 align:start position:0%
so R Pearson thank you thank you madam
chair

00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
the just making sure okay they're in
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
both option A and option b both use the
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
can you help us out with the definition
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
of that um I think that is an original
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
language um actually um I think if you
 
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:10.950 align:start position:0%
language um actually um I think if you
have

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
your um purple book with you um there's
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
a there's an actual definition in there
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
um I think um
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
rudimentary I could just say that it's
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh any of the
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
legislative activities that we normally
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
do here as representatives and across
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
the wall as Senators um voting um
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
submitting legislation talking about
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
legislation debating um anything that a
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
legislator would normally do go ahead
 
00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh this would
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
be ran numeral 11 on page three for
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
those following in their himels the
 
00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
official activities are activities which
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
relate to official responsibilities
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
including the introduction of
 
00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.950 align:start position:0%
including the introduction of
legislation

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
testifying before any legislative
 
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
committee or state agency voting in
 
00:53:08.789 --> 00:53:08.799 align:start position:0%
committee or in House and Senate session
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
or otherwise participating in
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
influencing influencing or attempting to
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.549 align:start position:0%
 
legislature

00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
so then we have as a legislator then you
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
are surren
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
rendering your rights as a citizen of
 
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
the state to even
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
testify on a bill if I'm reading this do
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
is that am I reading this
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
correctly um you may be reading it
 
00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you for your question um
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
I think you're word smithing it
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
differently than I would um
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
it again this um this ethics
 
00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.309 align:start position:0%
it again this um this ethics
is

00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
dealing with us and how we operate
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves and how we are perceived um
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
and by the public so so rather than
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
saying we're surrendering um I think I
 
00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:16.599 align:start position:0%
would be saying um we are
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
agreeing that um we need to hold
 
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:24.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves uh to a different standard
 
00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:35.720 align:start position:0%
in any other questions rep
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
costable um thank you madam chair and
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking a question um do
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
you have a preference on the percentages
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
for ownership and on on the stocks
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
because um on one hand 1% sounds like a
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
small number but 1% of a publicly traded
 
00:54:59.069 --> 00:54:59.079 align:start position:0%
large larger company is a tremendous
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
amount of ownership in terms of a
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
publicly traded company at the same time
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
there are some publicly traded companies
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
that are very small or or very like
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
one% seems to me versus five 5% seems
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
too much to
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
me you could have 3% ownership and that
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
could be very substantial for a company
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
um do you have um have you thought about
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
this is at all or or are the percentages
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
and um I think it's fair to say I've
 
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.640 align:start position:0%
thought about this
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
um I uh in my in my real life um I am a
 
00:55:45.549 --> 00:55:45.559 align:start position:0%
u a financial advisor Andor
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
um pension specialist um number of
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
things uh the 5% number does arrive does
 
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
come number of times and a number of
 
00:56:03.029 --> 00:56:03.039 align:start position:0%
places in in federal law um for instance
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
um if you're trying to uh determine if
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
someone is a um key employee of an
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
organization of a of a company um 5% is
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
the number that the IRS uses as if
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
you're 5% owner then you are deemed um a
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
highly compensated individual regardless
 
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
of your compensation so I guess um
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
I your point is is correct that um
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
depending on the organization 1% or 5%
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
can can vary tremendously but um I think
 
00:56:52.190 --> 00:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
one of these is just by using common
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
common numbers that are used in other
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
areas of finance and and
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
um you could say that it's arbitrary or
 
00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.039 align:start position:0%
it's based on just a feeling I I I think
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
you can argue either
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
way R Pearson thank you madam chair and
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Hill
 
00:57:19.789 --> 00:57:19.799 align:start position:0%
for taking the gauntlet here um by
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
virtue of office and I think that holds
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
true for all of us we are County
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
delegation folks
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
right as well I am but I sit on the
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
Executive Board of rocking Camp
 
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
County does do I now have a situation
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
where if we're
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
making or we're dealing with legislation
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
that involves counties or monies being
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
dispersed to counties because I sit on
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
the Executive Board of the
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
county as part of the county delegation
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
do I now have to under this recuse
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
myself from County
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
operations when it comes to State
 
00:57:58.990 --> 00:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
legislation because the state does do a
 
00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
lot of funding for
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
counties I'm not just a member of the
 
00:58:06.910 --> 00:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County like hops but I'm
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
actually on the executive
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
board I understand
 
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
not I would uh I guess I would answer
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
that two ways one is um as my personal
 
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.829 align:start position:0%
that two ways one is um as my personal
belief

00:58:25.829 --> 00:58:25.839 align:start position:0%
belief
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
um but understand that I am
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
not um going to say that my personal
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
beliefs will 100% align with um any
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
requests that you may or may not make to
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee for a ruling um so
 
00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:50.119 align:start position:0%
that the there are certainly going to be
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances where someone needs to
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
have clarified their their individual
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
position um this is not meant to be a
 
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the lipus test that um that an
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
individual rep may may decide if there
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
are circumstances like that it it may be
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
that we do need to have um um the Ethics
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
Committee Rule and and you've seen any
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
number of those that are printed in the
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
calendar um but my personal belief
 
00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
is even though you on the executive
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
committee um and your name is on the
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
county budget um with a
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
signature I would say
 
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
acting um almost as the
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.079 align:start position:0%
signature to what the county delegates
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
are doing so you're taking their
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
information and and you're signing off
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
on it as the executive committee you're
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
not specifically making the budget for
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
um for the county I I I I'd have to
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
think this through I mean I but that's
 
01:00:12.190 --> 01:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
my knee-jerk reaction I'm not
 
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.750 align:start position:0%
my knee-jerk reaction I'm not
sure

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
um and and I will be frank with you that
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
while we were doing the language here we
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
weren't anticipating
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
other govern government
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
um agencies monopolies um that that we
 
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
deal with like County we were more
 
01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
concerned with someone that worked for
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
an organiz a private or nonprofit um
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
organization rather than another
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
government um I do think that um someone
 
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
from ethics may be coming up after me I
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a pink card or not
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
but um that may be a better place to ask
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
that question I'm not sure um but that
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
would be my personal
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%

um and I want to start off with uh that
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
the government is here to serve the
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
people the people have the right to free
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
speech governments do not governments
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
are Servants of the people and when
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
people want change the government should
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
be able to give facts about the impact
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
of change but not Advocate one way or
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
the other lobbying with taxpayer money
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
is compelled speech the Supreme Court
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
has held that violation uh that it's a
 
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
violation of your first amendment rights
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
to for the government to make you say
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
something that you don't want to say
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
however what I am forced and we all are
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
forced to fun is someone to say
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
something that you may not agree
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
with um for examp like Jehovah's
 
01:06:19.549 --> 01:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
Witnesses do not Lobby vote for
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
political parties or candidates or run
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
for go government office or participate
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
in any action to change government uh
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
for religious reasons and their taxes
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
are used to fund speech they oppose so
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
in so in addition to a violation of free
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
speech this is a violation of their
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
continue this uh this bill is just
 
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
taking the current language that I
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
passed out to you since this is a
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
complete replace of that that language
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
is taking that current language getting
 
01:06:59.950 --> 01:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
teeth I have um heard some
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill like um nhma is
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
is giving a valuable resource of
 
01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
information however nhma still could
 
01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:20.680 align:start position:0%
come to give uh information about the
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
impacts it would just have to withhold
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
whe uh their opinion about whether we
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
should support or oppose such
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislation unless they segregate the
 
01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
money that they wanted to use for
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
lobbying from uh from other taxpayer
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
money and that that could be from
 
01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
sources like their trainings where you
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
pay additional fee to go to their
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
training that is in taxpayer money that
 
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640 align:start position:0%
is um fee for service right and so they
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
could use that money for lobbying or
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
they could have whole a bake sale or any
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
other uh way to to gather money other
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
than taxpayer you know uh forced
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
contributions um and and I have been a
 
01:08:11.789 --> 01:08:11.799 align:start position:0%
part of those um nhma policy setting
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee and advocated for them to not
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
oppose legislation created to limit
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities from violating
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and the response
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
is other groups uh advocate for the
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
protection of Rights we are here to
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
advocate for the
 
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities interest they advocate
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
for the power to Institute rent control
 
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
in in Municipal County government
 
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh they they advocate for to
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
allow those municipalities to
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate based on familial status um
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
in some of the recent bills in my
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee um there are many cases of
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
Municipal overreach from
 
01:08:59.950 --> 01:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities um passing an ordinance
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
that says that if you want to be a
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
tattoo artist in in their town that you
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
doctor there is um they also there is a
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
t town in this state that um would give
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
children a 250 or $275 fine for feeding
 
01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
or chasing water foul like on the beach
 
01:09:30.669 --> 01:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's what that's what we
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
want and and then also they do stuff
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
like forbidding carrying around o
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
unopened alcoholic beverages on any
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
Street sidewalk alley public or
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
semi-public parking lot or any public
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
space because they're just bad at
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
writing laws because they forgot to
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.269 --> 01:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
containers as we sit in this committee
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
room today lobbying as the as the law
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
that I passed out with State money is
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
not allowed in fact most if not all
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities receive state money
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
whether that be education trust funds or
 
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
Highwood block grants or meals and rooms
 
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
tax and according to RSA 155
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
currently they are not allowed to lobby
 
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
with that money and if they don't
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
segregate that money from their other
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
money in a separate bank account not
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
just on their books all of that money
 
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
then counts as state money and they're
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
not allowed to use any of it for
 
01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.669 align:start position:0%
not allowed to use any of it for
lobbying

01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
so I reached out to my Town
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
Administrator and verified that they're
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
not segregating their their money that
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
they receive from the state for money
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
that they can use for lobbying and money
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
that they can't use for lobbying so I
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
believe that all the municipalities I
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
think that it's common practice and I
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
think that all municipalities think that
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
they're Above This
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
law I think that all the municipalities
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
are in violation of the current RSA 155
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
and I sent out I pass around a a letter
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to be giving to the
 
01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to be giving to the
attorney

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
general for to to have the Attorney
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
General investigate every single
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
municipality and and find out if they
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
are segregating their funds as required
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
by this law because as you as I got a
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
letter from my municipality saying that
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're they one of the reasons why they
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
want to be able to uh donate to HMA nhma
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
is that they want Advocate advocacy
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
services at the State House they want
 
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
lobbying as part of their dues it's not
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
not just um for training it's not just
 
01:12:00.629 --> 01:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
for Legal Services they want lobbying
 
01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
and that is a violation of their law if
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're not currently in compliance and
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be sending that request
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
over to the AG's office after this
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
testimony today and I think that this
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
law that I'm putting in like if they are
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
found to be in non-compliance all the AG
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
will do is say cease and desist just
 
01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:25.159 align:start position:0%
send them a letter what I believe that
 
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
they should be doing uh is not doing any
 
01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
of that with any of the the taxpayer fun
 
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
money not just the money that they got
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
from the state and so I I want this law
 
01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
this law will be clear that it's it's
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
going to be applying to them and and
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
then also it imposes penalties if they
 
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
don't comply it's not just going to be a
 
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
letter they're actually going to be
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
charged with the crime for for misusing
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers money for things that
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to be doing and so
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
for that reason I hope that you will
 
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
join me in supporting hb1
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
1479 and I am open to any
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
questions I'm going to bet that there
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
are one or two um thank you for your
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
testimony um do I see hands for
 
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:25.400 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair uh thanks for
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question so and and part of
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
the section 155 you're pointed out in
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
state funds I might be confused that's
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
why I'm asking State funds and Municipal
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
aren't they two separate things thank
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
you for the
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
question um State funds I've I've asked
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
nhma before about why they or do they
 
01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
segregate and they said no because they
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't receive any state funds however if
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
you look at um 155 Roman 2 that if they
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
want to use state fund or other funds
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
that are not State funds they have to be
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
in a separate bank account and so once
 
01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
you put them into the same bank account
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
they essentially all tainted as state
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
funds so if the municipalities do not
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
currently have separate funds all their
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
money becomes State funds according to
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
this the current law on the books and
 
01:14:17.709 --> 01:14:17.719 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to use any of that
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
for lobbying and so um that is the basis
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
of my my concern today thank you for the
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
question further questions I have one
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
for you um can you do you have an
 
01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:35.080 align:start position:0%
opinion of
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether this
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and perhaps even
 
01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.950 align:start position:0%
legislation and perhaps even
155

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
155
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
um what but specifically on your on your
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislation should it be in a different
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
section of law um and the reason I'm
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
asking I guess is whether this seems to
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
be a pro ition on the lobby it's in the
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyist section
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
155 is it not more or would it not be
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
better placed in in the cities and towns
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
um sections because it's a Prohibition
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
on the cities and towns and what they
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
can do rather than what the lobbyists
 
01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.950 align:start position:0%
can do rather than what the lobbyists
can

01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
do thank you for the question I think
 
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.350 align:start position:0%
do thank you for the question I think
that

01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
um the lobby section actually kind of
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
makes sense because when the person
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
um first of all in in paragraph two it
 
01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.669 align:start position:0%
um first of all in in paragraph two it
um

01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
it uh I thought it ref
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
references this
 
01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.790 align:start position:0%
references this
um

01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
the um I thought it
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
referenced like this paragraph parag no
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
maybe it doesn't um I think that I think
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
that when the person is coming to Lobby
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
they they are the one that could be
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
creating the violation right so if the
 
01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
town pays someone and hires them and
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
they have to go register as a lobbyist
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
and then they see this
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
law and they will say wait a minute I
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
just got paid from a municipality or I
 
01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
just got paid this money is coming from
 
01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that is where they would
 
01:16:18.189 --> 01:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
be like hey I could be in violation
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
because you're not really in violation
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
until you come and Lobby right uh
 
01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
I'm giving myself a followup
 
01:16:32.669 --> 01:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
um so um how would the lobbyist know
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
sale um thank you representative Pearson
 
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.390 align:start position:0%
sale um thank you representative Pearson
for

01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's I I think that's a fair question
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
um I'm it's really a technical Point
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
more than anything else it's it's just a
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
an observation I wonder whether you
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
contemplated putting it in uh or filing
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
it in I did not because the it because
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
we're essentially uh I use a lot of the
 
01:17:13.149 --> 01:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
language in my bill um from the current
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
155 right and and so obviously
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
conflicting statute so I would have to
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
repeal it and put it in a different
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
section and so um that was I think
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of what I was in y I
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate your answer um further
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions is representative
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
Kierney thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm also selectman
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
sure in the town I live in I have a
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility to the
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in that town not to waste
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
their money
 
01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
nhma gives me legal advice for a minor
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
fee I believe of around $1,200 a year
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
any amount of questions I want to ask if
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
I have to go to the town attorney it's
 
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
$300 to $600 an hour so I'm going to get
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere from four two to four hours
 
01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's it and then I'm paying more money
 
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
that is not showing a fiduciary
 
01:18:13.110 --> 01:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the taxpayers that's
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
charging them for asking reasonable
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
questions nhma does it for
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
I I I would I would believe that
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
as I would believe that as a as a budget
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
Committee Member and a zba member in my
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
town that I have reached out for
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
nha's legal advice but that is not
 
01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
lobbying so that's not within the scope
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
of this bill if if nhma sto lobbying
 
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
today they would still be able to give
 
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
you those
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
Services whether or not this this bill
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
passed so that's that's you know
 
01:18:56.629 --> 01:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
information is not that barred by this
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
so that that's kind of outside of the
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
scope of this as being influenced by
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation have a followup
 
01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:04.110 align:start position:0%
this legislation have a followup
question

01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
yeah how would I track all the bills
 
01:19:09.910 --> 01:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
going through the house or the Senate
 
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
and HMA does that for
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
me even as a member I can't track all
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
the bills going through that does this
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
one pertain to a town does this one have
 
01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
an impact on a Town they're going
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
through dozens of committees up
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
here thank you for the question um once
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
again that that information that they
 
01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
give to the towns about interested bills
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
that they would be is not lobbying
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
that's just providing information it's
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
when they come up here and say kill this
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
bill don't vote for that bill vote for
 
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
that bill that is what lobbying is so
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
they they would still be able to provide
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
updates you know monthly updates or
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
whatever um as they do from time to time
 
01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:53.239 align:start position:0%
as far as definitely when legis ative
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
session is over and the Law changes they
 
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
would still be able to do those updates
 
01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
sellers thank you Mr chair so I know
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
we're picking on
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
NH because as an example yeah um since
 
01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:19.159 align:start position:0%
we're using them can you tell me is nhma
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
free and how do they deter if not how do
 
01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
they do you know how they deter
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
I do have a pin card from
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
NH I just ask yeah is it free it's not
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
and it's based on your population so
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
less population less
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
money further
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
questions I have another one sure
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
um section four uh I'm sorry section
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
five Roman 5 says not withstanding any
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
other provision of law any person who
 
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.270 align:start position:0%
other provision of law any person who
knowingly

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
knowingly
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
authorized who who is that person um is
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
that the selectman is that the Town
 
01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
Administrator is that someone else how
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
how would that be determined and who
 
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
fee sorry thank you for the question um
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
I believe that the the
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
person where responsible would be the
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
Selectmen they are they uh get a notice
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
of all kind of the checks that are going
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
to be uh written and they approve that
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know and so I think it's the
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
governing body not necessarily the
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
select board depending on governing body
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
of the town would be the responsible
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
party so if it's a threepers select
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
board and one doesn't vote for it is
 
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
that person not liable is that how that
 
01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.629 align:start position:0%
that person not liable is that how that
would

01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:21:51.639 --> 01:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
would
work

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um if they
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
refrain from voting for it I would
 
01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
believe that they're not culpable yeah
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
but I think that the pro the you know
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
the select board kind of makes an action
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
all as a collective body or not right so
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
so you uh thank you I think it would be
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
the person that literally signed the
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
like authorized the signing of the check
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah or or sign the
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
check if the if that is not the
 
01:22:23.229 --> 01:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
governing body then it would be the
 
01:22:24.750 --> 01:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
person signing the check would be the
 
01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:26.719 align:start position:0%
responsible person right
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative sellers thank you Mr
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
J We're not trying to make this a
 
01:22:34.030 --> 01:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
conversation by the way too so y but
 
01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm leading up what you were saying
 
01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
there because it's interesting because
 
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
if I was uh one of the fathers or
 
01:22:43.629 --> 01:22:43.639 align:start position:0%
mothers there at the town running the
 
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
town once I hand that money over to that
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh company that might be helping us like
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
nhma sure I'm thinking to help for me in
 
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
the town as far as legal advice and
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
whatnot right um if they separate or
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't separate I have no clue so the
 
01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
punishment shouldn't be on me should it
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
should be on the uh nhma or the one that
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
receives the money for not well the the
 
01:23:13.629 --> 01:23:13.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um if you're
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
not if you're not per Contracting
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
Services for
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
lobbying then you would just be um doing
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation and they would be the
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
responsible party for receiving an
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation of State money right so
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
they have the same responsibility once
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
money representative
 
01:23:41.709 --> 01:23:41.719 align:start position:0%
pay hello good morning I'm just curious
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
could you just tell briefly tell us the
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
why why did you bring this bill forward
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious of why why yeah why
 
01:23:53.199 --> 01:23:54.510 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious of why why yeah why
what's

01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
what's
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
your because I think it's that it's um
 
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
you know whether the examples that I
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
gave um that I found that it was
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
unreasonable that this the city or the
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
town actually in this example um made a
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
request or or made this regulation that
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
that tattoo artists be medical doctors I
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
think that's inappropriate and I would
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
like to um
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
advocate for restrictions so that they
 
01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
can't abuse their power and I believe
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
that I should not have to pay for
 
01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
funding my opposition which will come
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
out and say no they you know it was an
 
01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
honest mistake or or whatever the reason
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
is we should be able to have just um un
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
unlimited power at the municipality and
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
I don't want that advocated using my
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
money so I and and I'm sure you will
 
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
hear some testimony today from people
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
that don't want their money advocating
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
for things that they oppose
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
you um last one I promise um public
 
01:25:10.149 --> 01:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
funds no public funds
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned the bake sale um does
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
the bake sale become public funds once
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the public once it's in the
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
coffers of the town or the
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
municipality this this is talking about
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
in Roman uh two or is it I was um no
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
public funds shall be used and it
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
defines public funds as a grant or
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation um so
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
only only money that comes through
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
taxation um does it does it not apply to
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
fees or um dog licenses or um bake sales
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
does that not apply thank you for the
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
question I was um and and the
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify when I was making
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
that example I was giving the example
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
that nhma could still Lobby if they held
 
01:26:07.590 --> 01:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
a bake sale they aren't tax tax they
 
01:26:10.149 --> 01:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
aren't the government right um or or if
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
they did a training which they do and
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
and you sometimes have to pay for that
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
service right those monies would not be
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
coming from the tax for from taxpayer
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
right I apologize I misunderstood um
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
but but getting back to my question are
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
public funds do they become public funds
 
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
as soon as they're in the coffers of the
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
so the thank you thank you for yeah
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
making making the opportunity for me to
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify that yeah so this just like
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
the state right now all money is not
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used for for lobbying
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
municip this would also apply to
 
01:26:50.669 --> 01:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
counties and and local municipalities
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
none of their money can be used for
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
lobbying it's for those other groups
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
that may get an appropriation that want
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
to still be able to Lobby let's say the
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
the um let's say the town's clerks
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
Association to pick just pick a
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
different one um they want to Lobby they
 
01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
get some money from the state they do
 
01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.149 align:start position:0%
get some money from the state they do
some

01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
trainings right and they have that money
 
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
in a separate bucket that they can then
 
01:27:17.229 --> 01:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
use that money for lobbying right and so
 
01:27:18.990 --> 01:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
that would be the example but no State
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
money it would just they could just come
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
and give information
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
as a member of that that municipality
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%

01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
Lobby thank you we have lots of pin
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%

that it's all tax dollars all of it
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%

be paying for the trainings but you it's
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
not required under you know statute that
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
they be paid for by the state so
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
that's and and and they're not for for
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%

I see some friendly faces here good
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
morning they're all friendly faces uh
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
for the for the record my name is Keith
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
Ammon uh I live in New Boston I
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
represent New Boston line bro and Mount
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
Vernon and it's Hillsboro District 42
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor on this bill um I won't
 
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:15.880 align:start position:0%
repeat uh any of many of the points that
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative yella mentioned um I
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
do want to say that I find the compelled
 
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
speech argument very uh compelling to to
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
reuse the word um that that people are
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
being people are paying taxes for
 
01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts that that sometimes and
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
oftentimes uh work against individual
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
taxpayers interests and I think that is
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
probably the Crux of this bill
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
um if you you live in a town or a city
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
that town has many departments right it
 
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
has a select board or a board of
 
01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.709 align:start position:0%
has a select board or a board of
alderman

01:29:52.709 --> 01:29:52.719 align:start position:0%
alderman
 
01:29:55.709 --> 01:29:55.719 align:start position:0%
planning board uh school board on and on
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
and on it goes every one of those uh
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
departments in your municipality has an
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
association uh that they pay dues into
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
using taxpayer money those associations
 
01:30:11.669 --> 01:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
all cluster within about a mile from
 
01:30:13.430 --> 01:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
here in what used to be called The Local
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
Government Center if you've ever
 
01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
strolled through that hallway in that
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
building there's offices after offices
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
after offices of all of these
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
associations they're all clustered in in
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
one spot for the most part and you know
 
01:30:29.229 --> 01:30:29.239 align:start position:0%
I find that interesting that it's it's
 
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
basically an industry that's popped up
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
around uh dues from these different town
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
mun Municipal
 
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
departments uh sometimes in the millions
 
01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
of dollars collectively across the state
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
and they send their lobbyists here to
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
the different committees that we serve
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
on for $100 a year that's what we get
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
paid uh and these people get paid maybe
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
$60,000 a year $80,000 a year to come
 
01:30:59.550 --> 01:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
and Lobby for particular
 
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
positions that their their Association
 
01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:03.510 align:start position:0%
positions that their their Association
uh

01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
takes it's gotten to the
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
point when you submit a bill to OS to
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
office of legislative
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
Services OS will send that bill the
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
pre-draft of that bill to some of these
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
associations they get to weigh in on the
 
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:20.750 align:start position:0%
associations they get to weigh in on the
fiscal

01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
note they get to put their finger on the
 
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
scale Before the bill is even
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
released they're treated as if they're
 
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
part of the government and they're not
 
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
they're private
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
organizations um an institution the
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
prime directive of every institution is
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
to perpetuate
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
itself so these institutions these
 
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
entities may do good
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
work they they may serve a useful
 
01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
function but they're not entirely unself
 
01:31:51.149 --> 01:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
interested they have their own
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
self-interest to perpetuate to grow
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
their membership grow their influence
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
and they're doing it for a large part
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
with taxpayer money the questions
 
01:32:03.669 --> 01:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
earlier about trainings Information
 
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
Tracking bills none of that's lobbying
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
they can still do that they can still
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
they can still provide your help you
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
with your
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibilities as as a
 
01:32:16.709 --> 01:32:16.719 align:start position:0%
selectman um they can provide you with
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
information it's when they put on the
 
01:32:20.669 --> 01:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
orange badge and they come to our
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
committee rooms and they they don't have
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
when when a department head comes before
 
01:32:27.390 --> 01:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
you they usually say we take no position
 
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
on this bill but we have some questions
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
right they don't do that they they take
 
01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.350 align:start position:0%
right they don't do that they they take
a

01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
position uh and they advocate for a
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
position and they're doing it with
 
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money so the people on the
 
01:32:40.430 --> 01:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
other side of their position the people
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
who oppose their position are being
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
forced to fund their own adversaries and
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
I think there's an issue with that so
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
that that's my contribution to the
 
01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you for hearing the
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
um you will take
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions um representative
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
Cal thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:07.239 align:start position:0%
would you still be in favor of this bill
 
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
if say we amended maybe we have
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions on the um enforcement part of
 
01:33:18.109 --> 01:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
the the penalties and you know lessen
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
the penalties or maybe even eliminated
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
the penalties would you be in favor of
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
that bill is it still a net positive
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
there or do we need do we need the
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
penalties so we can always increase
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
penalties at a future date if there's an
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
issue I I would say look at the current
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
legis the current RSA that
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative yella referenced and sort
 
01:33:39.510 --> 01:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
of match what is happening already with
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
with uh you know whatever enforcement is
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
currently in the
 
01:33:46.750 --> 01:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
statute that would be my
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion representative
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
hubson thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um could you
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
repeat the statistic that you just
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned about OS sending off was it
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
lsrs and is it before they are released
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
to the public before they're released to
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
the committee yeah it's happened to be
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
on several occasions recently and this
 
01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
is kind of a new phenomenon as far as my
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
experience you put in a bill it may it
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
may have an implication for
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh or some other schools
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is right
 
01:34:26.109 --> 01:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
and the association the private
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
Association that is not part of the
 
01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
government is treated as if it's a
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
department of the state and they get to
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
write up a fiscal note it's attached to
 
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that everyone reads and it's it
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
puts their finger on the
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
scale uh no other group gets that kind
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
of uh you know Advanced uh you know
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
weight added to their opinion and and I
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.109 --> 01:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
good should that
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
um should that be a separate
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill where where fiscal notes um go to
 
01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
I'm giving you an example of so I'm
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
focusing on lobbying that's what this
 
01:35:13.470 --> 01:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
bill's about I understand so what what
 
01:35:16.189 --> 01:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
other lobbyist gets to write their
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
opinion into the fiscal note that's
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
attached the bill and circulated to
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
everyone that reads it like there there
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
isn't another so uh it it maybe maybe
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a separate bill I this was
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
just a conversation between you and I no
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
one else was listening it was just about
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
whether there should be a separate bill
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
we'll have to put that one in yeah all
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh representative sers
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
Sor first thank you Mr chair so and I'm
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
going back to represent representative
 
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
hopson's point of view OLS I thought
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
those are supposed to be private and not
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
insecure and not given out at all I know
 
01:35:53.709 --> 01:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
the bill or the LSR itself but even the
 
01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would indicate that hey this
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
is a bill that's
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
happening have you actually seen this
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
have you absolutely seen it this term on
 
01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.350 align:start position:0%
have you absolutely seen it this term on
my

01:36:04.350 --> 01:36:04.360 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
bill okay so so I think I think the the
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
way it works is you have to request as a
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
when you file as a legislator you have
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
to request that the bill remain private
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
I think you have to take that action so
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
and I did not do that
 
01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
but done representative
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh payer sorry thank you um I would just
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
would like to see if you had an opinion
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
about um we've received this committee
 
01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
has received many letters of from
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
various towns throughout New Hampshire
 
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
Claremont um from Council City councils
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
slackman boards Town
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
managers Salem for example Claremont for
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
example and a bunch of other towns um
 
01:36:52.669 --> 01:36:52.679 align:start position:0%
and they are in opposition of this bill
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
um do you have any could you give a
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
brief opinion or whatnot as to why a all
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
these towns would be in opposition of
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
your bill how many towns did you did you
 
01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
hear from can I ask a
 
01:37:06.239 --> 01:37:09.030 align:start position:0%
hear from can I ask a
question

01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:11.950 --> 01:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
would so why would I imagine that I
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
think maybe uh some uh dust has been
 
01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
stirred to have them write those letters
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay I think uh we're out of questions
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%

that it would be best for all of us if
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
you have if the prior speakers have said
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
something that you agree with you merely
 
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
say that you agree with um rather than
 
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
um telling us the same thing over and
 
01:38:07.830 --> 01:38:07.840 align:start position:0%

01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%

um uh or AI a financial Financial reason
 
01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.510 align:start position:0%
um uh or AI a financial Financial reason
for

01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
um uh wanting our
 
01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
business um and there's a lot to gain
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
from our families
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
financially um
 
01:40:14.109 --> 01:40:14.119 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately what they are doing
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
is with all of the
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
agencies surrounding our families with
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
disabil ities in particular as they are
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
um keeping our families in
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
poverty um because that is what benefits
 
01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
all of our all of these
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
agencies and so um these lobbyists are
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
not interested in what is beneficial to
 
01:40:45.870 --> 01:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
the families per se they are interested
 
01:40:50.189 --> 01:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
what in what is beneficial to them um
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know Financial
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
speaking so um you know they will sit
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
there and they will say that they are
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
fighting for families with
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities um all the time but they
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
are not they are looking at the bottom
 
01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
line uh for their
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
agencies so um there are many people
 
01:41:13.119 --> 01:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
agencies so um there are many people
that

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:15.950 align:start position:0%
that
are

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
on different
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
committees that um should not be
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
there because
 
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
different conflicts um very severe
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interests
 
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know our um our privy to
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
information that um and and have
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
power um again that
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
to make decisions for
 
01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:56.350 align:start position:0%
to make decisions for
families

01:41:56.350 --> 01:41:56.360 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
um that is just again
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
keeping all of us basically locked in
 
01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
this poverty
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
situation um most of which are
 
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
single single Le families like single
 
01:42:18.990 --> 01:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
moms with kids with

disabilities um and what I can suggest

and on um is if you want to get more

01:42:59.310 --> 01:42:59.320 align:start position:0%
it's all about
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:08.440 align:start position:0%

01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
families that need them great and the
 
01:43:18.189 --> 01:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
inflated salaries that are obscene so uh
 
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:21.800 align:start position:0%

01:43:39.870 --> 01:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
towns it's probably anyways have you
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%

I have walked it I have um it
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
also um in addition to the in addition
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
to the being locked into the poverty
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
industry um it expands to um all of the
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
programs that are created that you know
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
all of these wonderful programs that are
 
01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
available for everyone across the state
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for the little bit of
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:21.149 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for the little bit of
sarcasm

01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
sarcasm
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
um you know there's
 
01:44:26.990 --> 01:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
there's you know hundreds of programs
 
01:44:28.510 --> 01:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
available um but
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
when you know in reality when you go to
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
access these
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
programs they aren't
 
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
available um so you are turned
 
01:44:48.830 --> 01:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
away um you are too complicated you um
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
they there there are are so many reasons
 
01:44:55.229 --> 01:44:55.239 align:start position:0%
um why you cannot access these
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
programs um they just are not available
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
and I would really love to know why or
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
where these millions of dollars um are
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
really going I mean you know obviously
 
01:45:12.270 --> 01:45:12.280 align:start position:0%
there's obviously they do fund the you
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
know the lawyers on the other um people
 
01:45:19.950 --> 01:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
that are accessing or you know working
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
in the program s however um there's a
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
surplus of funds as well that are
 
01:45:26.830 --> 01:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
right I just want to get clar so
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
basically what she's saying if I
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly is the towns are
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
giving these public funds to lobbyists
 
01:45:48.149 --> 01:45:48.159 align:start position:0%
which are say these um um benefits are
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
available to people but then when you go
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
to get the benefit it's they're not
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
actually there right thank you great I
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
can give you some examples of the
 
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
programs but if you could provide those
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
U Offline that would be great okay um
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%

01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%

okay what um how how do could you please
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself my name is Alison NAB
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm from Rockingham 12 uh which is
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
stratum over in the Sea Coast I'm also
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
the vice chair of the stratum select
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
board and I've been on the town
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission for about 15
 
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
years um you have received a letter from
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
our town in opposition to this bill but
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to come speak against it
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
as well um the budgets in our town as in
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
most towns are set by Town staff and the
 
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
select board the budget advisory
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee and are authorized at Town
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
meeting um these funds can be used to
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
keep us informed and participate in the
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
legislative process as any industry
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
impacted by legislative legislation set
 
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
by the state house this legislation
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
affects many things for a town including
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
things from meeting minutes to zoning
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances and it is impossible for me
 
01:47:09.910 --> 01:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
to imagine that our town select board
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
planning board Conservation Commission
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
Town staff would be able to follow
 
01:47:14.830 --> 01:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
legislation on their own and to advocate
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
for it to come here and Advocate it for
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
it um I think this letter we wrote you
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
is probably one we've written maybe like
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
we've written three in five years so
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
having um an organization that helps
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
keep us informed on legislation and to
 
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
advocate for us it's extremely important
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
and lastly I'll just say that I think a
 
01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:35.480 align:start position:0%
bill that um that includes penalties and
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
charges against Volunteers in towns will
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
have a chilling effect on the volunteers
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
that keep our towns running so that is
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
another matter of concern about this
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and I thank you for your
 
01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
time I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
costable thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question um can you
 
01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
who is who is the US that um is being
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
advocated for um and does that include
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
your uh the town people as well yes yes
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously like in every town our
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
town select board planning board
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
committees are trying to make the best
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
decisions possible for the town and um
 
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
keeping us informed on legislation
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to impact us it's
 
01:48:18.669 --> 01:48:18.679 align:start position:0%
incredibly important the town's people
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's part of the reason I ran for the
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
State House I felt like the long arm of
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
conquered kept knocking on our door with
 
01:48:26.109 --> 01:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
new regulations and decisions that
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
impacted our boards our committees and
 
01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:29.830 align:start position:0%
impacted our boards our committees and
our

01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%

bill welcome to legislative
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
Administration oh good morning um I
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
normally am in the education committee
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
so it's nice to be here um my name is
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
Amry Banfield for the record I am a
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
parental rights advocate in New
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire focused on education so I'm
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
going to probably speak more to your
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
school boards Association School
 
01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.390 align:start position:0%

01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
Association the practice of using tax
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
dollars out of the school budget for
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
lobbying takes money away from public
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
education so we need to be very clear
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
about that I would imagine that most
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have no idea that their money
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
is going to pay lobbyists who often
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
times Lobby against what they support
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is a big scam on taxpayers teachers
 
01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
must pay their representation why is it
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay for money to be taken out of the
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
budget to fund lobbyist for the school
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
boards and
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
administrators I've been advocating and
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
lobbying on behalf of parents throughout
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for about 15 years
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
oftentimes these two organizations will
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
offer opposing testimony they are parted
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
out of the school budget
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
I've never received a dime everything
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
I've done has been on a volunteer basis
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
this kind of lobbying by the nhba and
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
the nhsaa is not representative of all
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who fund these two
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
organizations schools are not funding
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
lobbyists for teachers or parents out of
 
01:51:10.679 --> 01:51:12.109 align:start position:0%
lobbyists for teachers or parents out of
the

01:51:12.109 --> 01:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
budget the nhsa and nhsaa take political
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
positions that their funders do not
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
support that is why we have a problem
 
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
with this because I know that that
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
question came up
 
01:51:25.119 --> 01:51:27.470 align:start position:0%
question came up
earlier

01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:51:31.069 --> 01:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
um if this is going to be acceptable
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
then this budget should be open up to
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
everybody they need to be paying every
 
01:51:38.189 --> 01:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
parent that comes and testifies why is
 
01:51:40.589 --> 01:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
it that we're discriminated against when
 
01:51:43.709 --> 01:51:43.719 align:start position:0%
it comes to funding lobbyists how about
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
paying the the parents who come for
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
special ed how about funding parents who
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
just come and speak
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
why is it just some get to lobby for
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
their political positions but nobody
 
01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:58.390 align:start position:0%
their political positions but nobody
else

01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
can I consider that Viewpoint
 
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination I follow legislation I'm
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
not and I'm on my own and I follow a lot
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
of legislation so I'm not sure why
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's so difficult for these towns um I
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
could use a secretary but I don't have
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
money for that
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
um these organizations uh I think you
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier do other things and
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
that again is not part of this bill so
 
01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
if they want to I know the nhba proposes
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
model legislation for
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
schools um but that model legislation is
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
being charged at this or being
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
challenged at the Supreme Court right
 
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
now so it's costing a school money to
 
01:52:48.669 --> 01:52:48.679 align:start position:0%
fight a parent who's suing the
 
01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
Manchester schools
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
over uh model policy that they suggested
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
to the school which they did withdraw
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
they did withdraw their support the
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
nhba but all policies at the school
 
01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
should be based on federal state laws
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
and rules shouldn't have you shouldn't
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
be able to pull out model legislation
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
because they're supposed to be based on
 
01:53:10.639 --> 01:53:11.669 align:start position:0%
because they're supposed to be based on
state

01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
laws um so I don't even think we're
 
01:53:16.069 --> 01:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
getting our money's worth when it comes
 
01:53:18.069 --> 01:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
to what they're doing in terms of
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
offering model legislation
 
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
but again this applies to lobbying and I
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
think that if we're going to have
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
lobbying then you know and you and if
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know if you don't accept this then
 
01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
how about a bill that opens up paying
 
01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
all of us thank
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you um
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
questions I have one sure um in your
 
01:53:48.629 --> 01:53:48.639 align:start position:0%
travels in 15 years um have you run into
 
01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
instances where
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
school boards or School administrators
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
weren't aware of laws that passed that
 
01:53:59.470 --> 01:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
maybe weren't
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
um enjoyed by the um the school
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
administrators or the school um boards
 
01:54:09.669 --> 01:54:09.679 align:start position:0%
Association have you have you heard of
 
01:54:12.069 --> 01:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
of information not being passed if it
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
was not um um favorable to the to the
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
school administrators or to the board um
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
so basically what you're saying is that
 
01:54:24.189 --> 01:54:24.199 align:start position:0%
the if the law passed it's supposed to
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
be put in policy correct and if it
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
didn't if it didn't get put in policy
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
have I seen that no I have not seen that
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
but I have seen the opposite with the
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
jbat policy where the policy if you
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the bottom you it always cites
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
laws and if you actually read the laws
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
that it's cited for instance in the jbab
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
policy uh under the Privacy section it
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
says for school Personnel to hide
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
information from parents about their
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
children this is why it's in it's being
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
challenged at the Supreme Court there's
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
no law that says that schools should be
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
hiding information from parents so that
 
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
model policy was not based on any
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
specific law that says you know hide or
 
01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
light a parents about information about
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
their children so the opposite I've said
 
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
I I've seen that makes sense
 
01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:21.990 align:start position:0%
I I've seen that makes sense
representative

01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:24.589 --> 01:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair have you seen
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
through the years uh where in you
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
focusing on schools districts one
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
District giving uh many districts give
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
to um the SBA for
 
01:55:42.990 --> 01:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
example and the SBA would Lobby for one
 
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
position over another position so
 
01:55:47.149 --> 01:55:47.159 align:start position:0%
basically one District wants this the
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
other District wants that but the SBA
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
has to take position on one of the other
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
um no I haven't seen where that that is
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
split in terms of because if somebody
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
would come in from a school district and
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
come before the legisl or before a
 
01:56:08.589 --> 01:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
committee they would probably be
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
speaking on their own behalf I do know
 
01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
that obviously they take a position um I
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
think the anti-bullying position several
 
01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
years ago uh I supported it uh because
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
it would hold schools accountable for
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
negligent gross negligence if they were
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
ignoring bullying and then um the the
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
school board's Administration or the
 
01:56:35.069 --> 01:56:35.079 align:start position:0%
school administr this has been several
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
years ago so I'm trying to do this by
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
memory I think opposed it at that time
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that the parents of
 
01:56:44.109 --> 01:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
kids who were
 
01:56:46.790 --> 01:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
bullied uh you know we had Parents
 
01:56:50.189 --> 01:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
testifying were were supportive because
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
one girl was thrown down the stairs at
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
at the Manchester school and when they
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
when they sued they got they got nothing
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
because there was nothing in the bill so
 
01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
there is a major conflict often times on
 
01:57:03.390 --> 01:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
based on what they're presenting with
 
01:57:05.550 --> 01:57:05.560 align:start position:0%
what the people who pay their
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
support Al um others no thank you very
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.310 align:start position:0%

01:57:24.069 --> 01:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
chair will
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
call trying to alternate here if it's
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
not uh clear it's kind of difficult to
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
do um chair will call uh Kimberly
 
01:57:39.390 --> 01:57:39.400 align:start position:0%

01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
always felt that the taxpayer fund spent
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
on membership um has dues has resulted
 
01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:07.719 align:start position:0%
in many times that amount in savings um
 
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
as direct result of the advocacy of
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
nhma most towns and cities could not
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
afford to devote staff time to
 
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
researching bills and then sending staff
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
here to conquer on a regular basis to
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
express their municipalities support for
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
or opposition to bills that would impact
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
their communities most towns have all
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
they can do to keep up with responding
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
with the many citizens who come to our
 
01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:33.800 align:start position:0%

a member you're a member of the New
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association is there
 
01:59:46.750 --> 01:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
it is there any sort of rules or

prohibition or requirements as a member
 
01:59:51.870 --> 01:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
that prohibits
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
you as a town to come up
 
01:59:58.510 --> 01:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
here and fight against a position of the
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
organization to which you belong to no
 
02:00:03.589 --> 02:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay I would feel the selectman in New
 
02:00:06.109 --> 02:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
London would feel free to come and speak
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
if they were opposed to something that
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
nhma was advocating that what you mean y
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I mean thank
 
02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:15.560 align:start position:0%
you uh I'll follow up on that um would
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
it be do you understand or um is it your
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
reading of the the existing of the bill
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
as it stands
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
now that it would prohibit you from
 
02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
testifying in the future I think that
 
02:00:31.310 --> 02:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question Mr chairman I
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
kind of wondered about that because I am
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
paid by the town so I'm government money
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
is paying me to be here at this moment
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm not a registered lobbyist so
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps I could still come here but I do
 
02:00:47.229 --> 02:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
I was I was wondering that myself
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes I one last question um have you ever
 
02:00:58.750 --> 02:00:58.760 align:start position:0%

about support for this bill I personally
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
don't know representative yala
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative sodi is one of my
 
02:02:11.790 --> 02:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
representatives from my area um but I
 
02:02:14.189 --> 02:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I don't want my
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars going to fund groups
 
02:02:20.109 --> 02:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
like nhba which
 
02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
often express opinions that are contrary
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
to my own and to my son's education I
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
have a son who has
 
02:02:29.229 --> 02:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
autism this is a little loud they never
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
make these for short people
 
02:02:36.709 --> 02:02:36.719 align:start position:0%
um my son and I have been involved in a
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
brutal battle which has emotionally left
 
02:02:43.229 --> 02:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
me completely bere because my son
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
deserves an education the state promises
 
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
him an education they say he's entitled
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
to an adequate education and I had to go
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
20 rounds with my school district to try
 
02:02:54.189 --> 02:02:54.199 align:start position:0%
and get him what the federal and state
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
law have promised
 
02:02:58.750 --> 02:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
me I have come up here to testify on
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
bills one of my bills which I wanted
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
sponsored was SB 381 which went before
 
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
the finance committee a committee which
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
I am not allowed to testify in front of
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
and my that the lobbyist nhba was right
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
there front and center and not only were
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
they allowed to testify before the
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
finance committee a committee to which I
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
was able to give zero input two two
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
lobbyists from the audience agreed to
 
02:03:24.149 --> 02:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
write an amendment for that committee on
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
that bill and they wrote a bunch of
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
stuff for themselves in that bill so I
 
02:03:29.669 --> 02:03:29.679 align:start position:0%
don't appreciate that and I'm making
 
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
that clear right now um I have seen
 
02:03:36.189 --> 02:03:36.199 align:start position:0%
lobbying organizations put loopholes to
 
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
make it so that schools don't have to
 
02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
follow the law I've seen them make it
 
02:03:41.069 --> 02:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
interpretations of the law that are not
 
02:03:42.790 --> 02:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
accurate I've been to some of the
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
trainings and I've seen their
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
interpretations of the law and
 
02:03:48.189 --> 02:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
personally if I were represented to
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
represent if I were elected to represent
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
the people I would want to know what the
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
people think not what some organization
 
02:03:55.950 --> 02:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
thinks you can still go to their website
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
you can still read their opinions they
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
do take positions on bills I track bills
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
I do it through the you guys upgraded
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
the system you can now just check off a
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
box and you get an email it's very easy
 
02:04:08.510 --> 02:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
um I want to tell you at present 4% of
 
02:04:11.149 --> 02:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
students on IEPs will have any
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for post-secondary Education
 
02:04:15.629 --> 02:04:15.639 align:start position:0%
yet the greater majority of them receive
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
regular High School diplomas why is that
 
02:04:22.549 --> 02:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
I sit on the state advisory committee
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
for special education and we have a
 
02:04:27.470 --> 02:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:29.709 --> 02:04:29.719 align:start position:0%
committee I also believe that these
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
lobbying these firms like nhma were
 
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
formed by members and they were for
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
towns to discuss issues within the Town
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
members they're no longer represented by
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
me members are the towns and the people
 
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
are members of them but they're run by
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys and the thing that attorneys
 
02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
like to do best is create more work for
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
attorneys in my town we have attorneys
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
redacting right to no requests we don't
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
need attorneys to redact right to no
 
02:04:55.229 --> 02:04:55.239 align:start position:0%
requests the attorneys are probably
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
laughing is they're paying aemp $7 an
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
hour to black out a name so I am here to
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%

in align with lobbying groups or the
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
actual constituents and current research
 
02:05:16.510 --> 02:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
shows that laws are more in alignment
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
with lobbyist which represent a minor
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%

actually
 
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
ORS I occasionally have both ORS in the
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
water but I mostly operate on one I was
 
02:08:11.069 --> 02:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
I was
 
02:08:14.109 --> 02:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
misinformed that's quite all right so I
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
would just like to uh see if I can add
 
02:08:19.470 --> 02:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
to the testimony we've already heard
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh listening to representative yella and
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
others I would like to raise a couple
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
points uh a couple issues one it sounds
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
to me as though an inquire is required
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
and needed as a minimum as to how funds
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
are being handled and accounted for by
 
02:08:40.589 --> 02:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
towns and
 
02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh representative tyy uh
 
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this legislation could
 
02:08:50.549 --> 02:08:50.559 align:start position:0%
help or hurt his cause and it's obvious
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
that uh from what I've heard in
 
02:08:54.750 --> 02:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative Tierney's testimony and
 
02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
others that this is a
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh service for him however it
 
02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like the money is not being
 
02:09:06.350 --> 02:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
properly separated into different colors
 
02:09:09.229 --> 02:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
of money and by that I mean as a former
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
government auditor money is put in
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
different buckets for different uses and
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
it may be blue red white whatever yellow
 
02:09:19.149 --> 02:09:19.159 align:start position:0%
color the money is but if the money
 
02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
starts to get mixed into a different
 
02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
bucket and now we can't tell what color
 
02:09:26.910 --> 02:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
it is uh that is totally inappropriate
 
02:09:28.549 --> 02:09:28.559 align:start position:0%
and I was in a situation where a
 
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
president vice president of company
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
mixed that money and lost their job so
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh as a
 
02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:38.559 align:start position:0%
former auditor I would say that this
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
definitely needs to be looked into in
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
addition it sounds like what's happening
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
over at the LSR Arena also needs to be
 
02:09:49.549 --> 02:09:49.559 align:start position:0%
looked into as far as I'm I understood
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I read it this morning I
 
02:09:53.709 --> 02:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
believe in an email that was put out
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
that this is supposed to be private only
 
02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
those that are sponsors co-sponsors Etc
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
should have this information and if this
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
information is leaking out to lobus
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
somebody's hand needs
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
slapping and with that I think I'm
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
finished I'll take one
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
question who gets it you do you're the
 
02:10:15.679 --> 02:10:17.229 align:start position:0%
question who gets it you do you're the
chair

02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh your town um Chai Chester Chai
 
02:10:25.189 --> 02:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
Chester um are you aware whether your
 
02:10:25.199 --> 02:10:26.790 align:start position:0%
Chester um are you aware whether your
town

02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:10:30.510 --> 02:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
um a segregates the funds as they're
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
currently required in law from State
 
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
sources and B does your Town um get in
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
touch with you about issues that um are
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
affecting the town that are asking you
 
02:10:48.790 --> 02:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
to um represent them when they come to
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
when you come to conquer so because I
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
like you and I do know that was two
 
02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:55.390 align:start position:0%
like you and I do know that was two
questions

02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:10:58.189 --> 02:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
so so with that yes I was actually at
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
the pre-budget meeting for our town last
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
night and they do separate these kind of
 
02:11:04.109 --> 02:11:04.119 align:start position:0%
monies out to the best of my knowledge
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
from what I remember seeing and looking
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
over the budget and number two uh they
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
don't need to reach out to me so I'm I'm
 
02:11:13.390 --> 02:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
reaching out to them but it would be
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
nice if there was something going on
 
02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
that somebody would tip me off but there
 
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
is conversation there is um a a pipeline
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
for your town um to get their feelings
 
02:11:28.549 --> 02:11:28.559 align:start position:0%
known here in conquered through you or
 
02:11:30.030 --> 02:11:30.040 align:start position:0%

02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
this bill and to others and uh that's
 
02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
time I could have been spending on the
 
02:12:41.910 --> 02:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
job site right now uh painting a home so
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
that someone can go live in it in
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester but instead I'm here and I've
 
02:12:48.549 --> 02:12:48.559 align:start position:0%
done this on multiple occasions
 
02:12:50.830 --> 02:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
not getting paid to do it but what
 
02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
really grinds my gears is when I am up
 
02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
here and I take this time out of my day
 
02:12:57.790 --> 02:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
that I could be a productive member of
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
society paying taxes and instead I'm
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
here and my testimony is seceded by and
 
02:13:09.310 --> 02:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
preceded by individuals from these
 
02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
organizations like uh nhma but not just
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
nhma uh for which they hold entirely
 
02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
contrary uh opinions on the legislation
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
that they get to express at my cost and
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's just ridiculous that's like
 
02:13:29.950 --> 02:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
absurd and I'm I really appreciate that
 
02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
there were people here who are getting
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
paid right now at this testimony to
 
02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
testify against this bill who you know I
 
02:13:44.589 --> 02:13:44.599 align:start position:0%
don't want to be paying for them to be
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
advocating against what I want as a
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if they want to come here in
 
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
some unofficial capacity where I'm not
 
02:13:54.589 --> 02:13:54.599 align:start position:0%
footing the bill that would be great but
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not the case and so
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
um that's the first major point I I'd
 
02:14:02.830 --> 02:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
like to express in this testimony and
 
02:14:05.390 --> 02:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
the other is I wonder how many towns
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
that sent in letters to this committee
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
um also mentioned in those letters that
 
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
they clearly segregate These funds uh as
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
what is uh currently law
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
155 um so if you have any questions uh
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
for me uh I'm happy to take them uh
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
because this is not hypothetical it's
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
not hypothetical that like oh
 
02:14:33.069 --> 02:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
hypothetically there are people whose
 
02:14:36.910 --> 02:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
interests are being counter represented
 
02:14:39.629 --> 02:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
with their money here it's actually
 
02:14:42.229 --> 02:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
happened to me as someone who is not a
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
lobbyist here uh in
 
02:14:50.549 --> 02:14:50.559 align:start position:0%
conquer thank you um are there
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um have you ever
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
tried at the local level um to not
 
02:15:01.870 --> 02:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
have the the funds um
 
02:15:06.030 --> 02:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
paid by to lobbying organizations that
 
02:15:07.790 --> 02:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
um have you ever tried to have that
 
02:15:09.310 --> 02:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
removed from the
 
02:15:14.669 --> 02:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
budget no I have not gone to the um and
 
02:15:14.679 --> 02:15:16.790 align:start position:0%
budget no I have not gone to the um and
the

02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh the matter is different for cities
 
02:15:24.549 --> 02:15:24.559 align:start position:0%
and towns I think uh and I don't know I
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
could bring this up in the next um uh
 
02:15:31.430 --> 02:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
local meeting in Manchester about if
 
02:15:36.629 --> 02:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
they uh do this and if they don't if
 
02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
they'd be willing not to but my
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that nhma doesn't uh
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
give their members the opportunity to
 
02:15:50.189 --> 02:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
not do this that nhma doesn't ask
 
02:15:53.549 --> 02:15:53.559 align:start position:0%
members okay would you like us to not
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
allocate any funds to lobbying and if
 
02:15:58.549 --> 02:15:58.559 align:start position:0%
they did oh well that would be great and
 
02:16:02.669 --> 02:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
then I would Advocate that um the uh
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
Alderman that represent me and the mayor
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
choose not to but to my understanding
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
nhma and perhaps these other
 
02:16:13.549 --> 02:16:13.559 align:start position:0%
organizations do not give their members
 
02:16:15.629 --> 02:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to earmark those funds
 
02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
in that way and say oh no we don't want
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
any money to be spent towards lobbying
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question it
 
02:16:25.549 --> 02:16:25.559 align:start position:0%
certainly did uh representative sellers
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
has a followup I believe yeah thank you
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair have you been to a budget
 
02:16:33.790 --> 02:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
meeting and uh where they actually
 
02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:36.200 align:start position:0%
present the budget like a budget hearing
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
past I've I've reviewed the documents uh
 
02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
online but I have not physically myself
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%

uh further questions seeing none thank
 
02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%

thanks

02:28:25.750 --> 02:28:25.760 align:start position:0%

sorry please introduce yourself welcome
 
02:28:40.269 --> 02:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:42.269 --> 02:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
Administration back in Canada with my
 
02:28:44.150 --> 02:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
grandparents to be cut home but I but I
 
02:28:45.870 --> 02:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
call it Dave Karen I am the Town
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
Administrator in Derry and thank you for
 
02:28:49.550 --> 02:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
inviting me to speak and thank you for
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
your time uh I think we all can agree
 
02:28:55.070 --> 02:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
that this process here throughout the
 
02:28:57.630 --> 02:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
legislature is about a sharing of ideas
 
02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
and information and I think it behooves
 
02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
and benefits all of us the legislature
 
02:29:05.710 --> 02:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
towns and cities and our citizens who we
 
02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
serve to make sure that we do that in
 
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
the most efficient way possible so to
 
02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
provide some additional information is
 
02:29:16.030 --> 02:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
that every Community state is a member
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
of NH Ma and every other year we go
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
through a process called the legislative
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
policy process which essentially groups
 
02:29:26.309 --> 02:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
three different committees dealing with
 
02:29:29.230 --> 02:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
Finance General Administration and land
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
use and environmental to look at policy
 
02:29:34.349 --> 02:29:34.359 align:start position:0%
positions to present to all of our
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
members the combined participants in
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
that process represents 75 communities
 
02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
fully one-third of all of our of all of
 
02:29:45.630 --> 02:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
our folks they go through a process
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
whereby they have meeting meetings and
 
02:29:49.309 --> 02:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
then we have what I call is NH May's
 
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
town meeting where every town and city
 
02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
in the state has a seat at the table to
 
02:29:56.429 --> 02:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
review these policies and they vote on
 
02:29:59.550 --> 02:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
them they also adopt what they call
 
02:30:01.950 --> 02:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
guiding principles essentially there's
 
02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:03.070 align:start position:0%
guiding principles essentially there's
any

02:30:03.070 --> 02:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
legislation which doesn't fit to one of
 
02:30:08.910 --> 02:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
those categories they discussed our
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
professionals at
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
nhma comes back and Compares that
 
02:30:16.590 --> 02:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
legislation against the principles if
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
they're still unclear then the
 
02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
professionals will come back to the
 
02:30:21.910 --> 02:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
board of directors and we meet monthly
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
to review the legislation and request
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
direction from us so you can see it's a
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
really Bottoms Up approach and I hope
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
you agree with me it's very transparent
 
02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
and also it's very efficient now
 
02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
removing nhma from the process will just
 
02:30:40.990 --> 02:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the the efficiencies of the
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
process instead of having a coordinated
 
02:30:46.070 --> 02:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
process in which all communities
 
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
particip ipated at the outset you're
 
02:30:50.550 --> 02:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot more people here
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
testifying like I am today in which I'm
 
02:30:55.630 --> 02:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
not back in my hometown doing equally
 
02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:57.750 align:start position:0%
not back in my hometown doing equally
important

02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:31:01.389 --> 02:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
work second on the question about fiscal
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
notes I don't know what the process is
 
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
but I would think for efficiency it
 
02:31:09.070 --> 02:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
would make a lot more sense to get nh's
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
input into those which has a subject
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
matter expertise and has the input input
 
02:31:17.309 --> 02:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
of all the organizations as opposed to
 
02:31:19.269 --> 02:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
going out and trying to get information
 
02:31:22.269 --> 02:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
from 234 cities and towns because I
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
think at the end of the day we're all
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
looking for good government and I think
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
I I'm not quite sure what the impetus
 
02:31:31.389 --> 02:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
for this bill is but I know the end
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
result is is going to be less
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
communication there's going to be more
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
information falling through the crack
 
02:31:40.070 --> 02:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
craps and the not so good go not the
 
02:31:42.070 --> 02:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
good public policy we're trying to
 
02:31:44.190 --> 02:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
create through this process will be not
 
02:31:46.349 --> 02:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
as good as it was before so I stand
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
proposi this bill be glad to answer any
 
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:51.160 align:start position:0%

02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:58.840 align:start position:0%

on here just as dairy mun I'm sorry I'm
 
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
the town ministrator and I uh I serve
 
02:32:07.030 --> 02:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
the pleasure of the seven member elected
 
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
Town Council follow up follow up and may
 
02:32:13.710 --> 02:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
I ask uh is that a full-time position in
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
G yes I'm appointed okay thank you
 
02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
fulltime plus
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
one representative sers thank you Mr
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
chair you mentioned a few minutes ago
 
02:32:26.910 --> 02:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
that there'll be less Communications but
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing yourself here and I saw
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
another uh select board member here it
 
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
seems like more towns are coming out
 
02:32:36.269 --> 02:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
yeah more people are going to have to I
 
02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
I agree more people are going to have to
 
02:32:39.870 --> 02:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
come but that seems to me it's more
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
Communications would you agree or
 
02:32:44.110 --> 02:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
disagree on that I'm not following your
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
reasoning yeah thank thanks for the
 
02:32:47.950 --> 02:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
question I I suspect if there was one
 
02:32:49.910 --> 02:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal issue or maybe even a half
 
02:32:52.110 --> 02:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
dozen during a session it wouldn't it
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't impact our operations where you
 
02:32:57.030 --> 02:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
have as you know dozens upon dozens of
 
02:32:59.389 --> 02:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
legislation which impact municipalities
 
02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
and its taxpayers uh then it makes sense
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
to us to develop this Central Clearing
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
House of information and supported by
 
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
H yes Mr chair thank you you do realiz
 
02:33:18.429 --> 02:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is not saying they can't do
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
lobbying they just have to have that
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
money to pay the lobbyist from another
 
02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:25.469 align:start position:0%
money to pay the lobbyist from another
fund

02:33:25.469 --> 02:33:25.479 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
right I I I do see that and I just
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
question where those funds would come
 
02:33:35.550 --> 02:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
from in a realistic manner which just
 
02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:39.230 align:start position:0%
from in a realistic manner which just
won't

02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
happen um further questions I have one
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
reck Mard go thank you Mr Mr chair thank
 
02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so are you
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the um recent discovery
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
and I noticed it too as recently as last
 
02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
week that two of my bills um the fiscal
 
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
notes were either previewed or created
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
by the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:34:10.469 --> 02:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
Association are you suggesting that um
 
02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
our practice of doing that through our
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
um office of legislative Services isn't
 
02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:17.870 align:start position:0%
um office of legislative Services isn't
appropriate

02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
relationship uh when we as the
 
02:34:21.870 --> 02:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
representatives are supposed to be
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
presenting legislation that is for the
 
02:34:25.309 --> 02:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
benefit of our
 
02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
constituents is it your is it your do do
 
02:34:30.990 --> 02:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
you submit that this is an
 
02:34:34.230 --> 02:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh relationship for them to
 
02:34:38.030 --> 02:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
have preview legislation yeah let me not
 
02:34:39.469 --> 02:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
comment on relationship because I don't
 
02:34:41.630 --> 02:34:41.640 align:start position:0%
know much about the process my point is
 
02:34:44.349 --> 02:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
very simple is that before a committee
 
02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
or the legislature consider is any
 
02:34:49.269 --> 02:34:49.279 align:start position:0%
legislation you should have the benefit
 
02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
of the best available information I
 
02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree to that so
 
02:34:56.510 --> 02:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
whether nhma representing every
 
02:34:59.269 --> 02:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
community in this state provides your
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
information at the beginning of the
 
02:35:02.309 --> 02:35:02.319 align:start position:0%
process or at step two or step three I
 
02:35:03.870 --> 02:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
don't know about that but the
 
02:35:05.269 --> 02:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
legislature should have the benefit of
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
that information at some point during
 
02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:10.070 align:start position:0%
that information at some point during
the

02:35:10.070 --> 02:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
process further questions I have one
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
um we have some testimony that we
 
02:35:22.510 --> 02:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
received in um by um writing that
 
02:35:27.269 --> 02:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
questions um duplicity whether there are
 
02:35:31.790 --> 02:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
um um dues being paid to and we seem to
 
02:35:34.309 --> 02:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
be circling in on nhma but I think part
 
02:35:35.950 --> 02:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
of that is from the people that are
 
02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:38.030 align:start position:0%
of that is from the people that are
testifying

02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
um if if all the cities and towns are
 
02:35:42.590 --> 02:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
members of
 
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
nhma are there other within your your
 
02:35:51.469 --> 02:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
town are there other um groups of people
 
02:35:55.150 --> 02:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
that are also members of nhma that that
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
U those dues are paid for out of the
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds as well and and and this
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
was pointed out out of the County as
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
well that that they too may be also a
 
02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
member of nhma so in in the letter that
 
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
we received there were three separate
 
02:36:15.230 --> 02:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
organizations that all were paying dues
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
to the same organization is that is that
 
02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
possible in your
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
estimation thanks for the question I'm
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm confused I didn't follow
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
it along let me let me see if I can ton
 
02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
ofer pays dues at nhma we have like the
 
02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
Chief of Police Association in which the
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
chief has a line adance budget for that
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
Association and so they all have groups
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
that Advocate not Advocates a bad word
 
02:36:43.710 --> 02:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
to support them in their training in
 
02:36:45.150 --> 02:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
their conferences I don't know how much
 
02:36:48.429 --> 02:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
advocacy they actually do but I are they
 
02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
also I might apologize for the uh for
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
the confusion um are is the county that
 
02:36:59.110 --> 02:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
you belong to also a member of nhma and
 
02:37:02.429 --> 02:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
are are any of the cities in uh any of
 
02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
the Town Offices also members of nhma
 
02:37:08.429 --> 02:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
are there is it possible you could be
 
02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
paying multiple memberships to nhma well
 
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe Rockingham County is
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
a member of nhma
 
02:37:19.309 --> 02:37:19.319 align:start position:0%

02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
goes against free speech of the taxpayer
 
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
and is one of the reasons that we have
 
02:39:39.230 --> 02:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh continual corruption in government

regions again all pulled from nh's
 
02:42:38.309 --> 02:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
website I'll say it again this is a
 
02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
corrupt practice that allows for
 
02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
egregious spending misuse of taxpayer
 
02:42:44.790 --> 02:42:44.800 align:start position:0%

for the average citizen's advocacy
 
02:42:53.590 --> 02:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
efforts to prosper of this bill is not
 
02:42:55.950 --> 02:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
meant to limit a selectman or a public
 
02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
official from engaging in the public
 
02:43:00.190 --> 02:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
Prof process from engaging in the public
 
02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
process it's meant to prohibit them from
 
02:43:05.309 --> 02:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
paying lobbyists to do their job for
 
02:43:08.190 --> 02:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
them for all these reasons and more I
 
02:43:11.830 --> 02:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 1479 in its entirety
 
02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
and would encourage you all to do the
 
02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
same thank you for allowing me this time
 
02:43:20.030 --> 02:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
thanks written testimony do you have
 
02:43:22.030 --> 02:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
that you can submit to the clerk yes sir
 
02:43:23.790 --> 02:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely I don't have it with me right
 
02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
now but I can certainly submit it that'd
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
be great thank you uh further questions
 
02:43:30.389 --> 02:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you Mr chair
 
02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
so you believe are you you believe at
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
this point that the um nonprofits are
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
these Outside Agency that the talents
 
02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
would give money to don't necessarily
 
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
always represent the people
 
02:43:48.150 --> 02:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely um
 
02:43:51.150 --> 02:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
so the issue here is is that it's a free
 
02:43:55.630 --> 02:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
speech violation where um these towns
 
02:43:58.030 --> 02:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
and these municipalities obviously you
 
02:44:01.990 --> 02:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
can win a 51 to 49 race um and these
 
02:44:04.469 --> 02:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
these committee members and these
 
02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
Selectmen um can use the taxpayer
 
02:44:09.630 --> 02:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
dollars of people that might not
 
02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
completely agree with the positions that
 
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
they're pushing
 
02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
um so that that's it's it's it's it's a
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
way for public officials to have use
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars to compel the speech of
 
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
their taxpayers um where they might not
 
02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
always agree with the issues that
 
02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:30.870 align:start position:0%
always agree with the issues that
they're

02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:44:34.110 --> 02:44:34.120 align:start position:0%

school
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
district my opinion and this is my
 
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
personal opinion is that New Hampshire
 
02:45:30.790 --> 02:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association serves the same
 
02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:32.230 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association serves the same
exact

02:45:32.230 --> 02:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
exact
 
02:45:35.070 --> 02:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
people that the members of the
 
02:45:39.190 --> 02:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
legislature serve everybody all the
 
02:45:43.110 --> 02:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
towns in towns and cities in the state
 
02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire equals the same exact
 
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
people that the legislature represents
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
the same exact people so I find New
 
02:45:56.469 --> 02:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association speaking
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the towns and cities
 
02:46:03.670 --> 02:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
valuable valuable valuable information
 
02:46:08.349 --> 02:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
and valuable valuable input as to what
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
the cities in towns think what they need
 
02:46:14.630 --> 02:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
to do their job which is a different
 
02:46:17.309 --> 02:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
level of government but it is government
 
02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
also and they're trying to meet the
 
02:46:22.590 --> 02:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
needs of the same exact people we are
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
trying to meet down here in the
 
02:46:27.150 --> 02:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
legislature you know I hear the
 
02:46:30.030 --> 02:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
individual rights when you get involved
 
02:46:33.309 --> 02:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
in personal Liberties and individual
 
02:46:36.190 --> 02:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
rights it gets a little difficult
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
because the municipal
 
02:46:41.389 --> 02:46:41.399 align:start position:0%
Association um is looking at the global
 
02:46:43.790 --> 02:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
picture everybody what is good for the
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
environment what what is good to run the
 
02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
town under to provide a quality of life
 
02:46:52.830 --> 02:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
I find them very trustworthy I find them
 
02:46:56.990 --> 02:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
a very very very valuable resource of
 
02:47:00.429 --> 02:47:00.439 align:start position:0%
information now maybe there's a way to
 
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
them not being perceived as having as
 
02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
much impact such as perhaps weighing in
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impacts of bills maybe that
 
02:47:13.750 --> 02:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed if there's an
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
exception there and they're the only
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
ones that are weighing in to that degree
 
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
maybe that shouldn't happen I don't know
 
02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
but I think there's got to be a way to
 
02:47:29.269 --> 02:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
salvage this and here from the New
 
02:47:31.590 --> 02:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association in a
 
02:47:34.550 --> 02:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful way because they're well
 
02:47:37.990 --> 02:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
intended they're speaking for us as a
 
02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
state and as a
 
02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
town and that's just my personal View
 
02:47:46.590 --> 02:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
and I feel strongly about it I feel very
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
strongly about it and I have 52 years
 
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
experience observing and using and
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
participating in um their processes and
 
02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
participating in um their processes and
their

02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:02.590 --> 02:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
organization great thank you very much
 
02:48:04.469 --> 02:48:04.479 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh would you take
 
02:48:06.030 --> 02:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any yes
 
02:48:09.150 --> 02:48:09.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely are there any
 
02:48:11.790 --> 02:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative sers sorry I
 
02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
gota ask uh thank you honorable and um
 
02:48:18.630 --> 02:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for serving the legisl 52
 
02:48:22.950 --> 02:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
years three um in those all those years
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
have you ever seen maybe a decision from
 
02:48:26.990 --> 02:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
and we're again we're still picking on
 
02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
nhma but on on any of them like so the
 
02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
town of woodstar would want a bill that
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
would go this way or advocate for a bill
 
02:48:38.630 --> 02:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
that would go this way but the city of
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
Manchester wants to go this way have you
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
ever seen
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
that well that could happen obviously ly
 
02:48:49.950 --> 02:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
because um there are Regional
 
02:48:52.429 --> 02:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
differences um there's
 
02:48:57.190 --> 02:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
different um economies different um
 
02:48:59.870 --> 02:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
where I live uh we're in the northern
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
part of the state we might be more
 
02:49:04.750 --> 02:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
interested in in preserving the
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
environment and making sure we've got
 
02:49:10.030 --> 02:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
roads to get there uh so the tourists
 
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
can come see us and Manchester or
 
02:49:15.269 --> 02:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
conquer Nashville might have a
 
02:49:16.750 --> 02:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
have a different
 
02:49:20.269 --> 02:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
perspective um but I've been very very
 
02:49:22.990 --> 02:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
very involved on the regional Planning
 
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
Commission level also and I have found
 
02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
in general what is good for one is good
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
for all there's a lot of things you got
 
02:49:36.269 --> 02:49:36.279 align:start position:0%
to look at from a Woodstock point of
 
02:49:41.150 --> 02:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
view um and if you're a Woodstock
 
02:49:43.710 --> 02:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
official that even isn't your first
 
02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:45.469 align:start position:0%
official that even isn't your first
priority

02:49:45.469 --> 02:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
priority
 
02:49:49.349 --> 02:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
um but you got to consider it um I had a
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
friend that always would say a rising a
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
rising Tide Rises All Ships so what is
 
02:49:58.950 --> 02:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
good for Manchester is good for
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
Woodstock what it's one state it's a
 
02:50:03.750 --> 02:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
small state
 
02:50:07.670 --> 02:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
so um a town like Woodstock can kind of
 
02:50:10.590 --> 02:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
go along with something that seems like
 
02:50:13.190 --> 02:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
it might benefit Manchester more than
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
Woodstock and by Versa if it's good for
 
02:50:18.670 --> 02:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
the state it's good for jobs it's good
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
for the economy it's good for providing
 
02:50:24.190 --> 02:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
a place that people want to live that
 
02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
people want to visit what's good for one
 
02:50:28.110 --> 02:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
is good for
 
02:50:31.510 --> 02:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
all I think you might have disagreement
 
02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
with a place like Dalton they they may
 
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
think that Manchester doesn't speak for
 
02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
them but um thank you very much
 
02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:40.990 align:start position:0%
them but um thank you very much
representative

02:50:40.990 --> 02:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
payer hi thank you for being here um
 
02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
would do you since you've been in local
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
government for so long would does your
 
02:50:52.269 --> 02:50:52.279 align:start position:0%
town do town meeting format
 
02:50:58.229 --> 02:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
yes keep going okay um and if your
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
residents didn't want your town to spend
 
02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
money on a nhma or whatever within their
 
02:51:08.190 --> 02:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
budget would they be able to vote
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
collectively majority rule to take out
 
02:51:14.229 --> 02:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
those dollars Absol absolutely um my
 
02:51:17.309 --> 02:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
particular Town got mad at at an
 
02:51:19.630 --> 02:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
organization not Municipal Association
 
02:51:21.710 --> 02:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
but another one and we stopped paying
 
02:51:24.349 --> 02:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
dues for a while because we weren't
 
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
happy with them but we went back after a
 
02:51:31.389 --> 02:51:31.399 align:start position:0%
while and we went back so it's it's
 
02:51:34.590 --> 02:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely optional on the town level
 
02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
the ultimately the voters decide the
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
voters are would St decide where they
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
want to spend their
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
money and and um this isn't answering
 
02:51:48.870 --> 02:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
specifically that question but I I also
 
02:51:51.349 --> 02:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
have served on let's try to answer their
 
02:51:53.150 --> 02:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
question that would be good all right
 
02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank you but yes the vo is
 
02:51:59.590 --> 02:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
um can decide not to join our
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative costable thank you Mr
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
question are you telling me that at Town
 
02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
meetings that um the people can pull out
 
02:52:10.750 --> 02:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
just the lobbying effort would not not
 
02:52:14.510 --> 02:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
the do to nhma or any other Association
 
02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
but specifically what we're talking
 
02:52:18.229 --> 02:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
about here is lobbying efforts I'm not
 
02:52:21.630 --> 02:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
aware that lobbying is a separate line
 
02:52:23.710 --> 02:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
item that we that the people can take
 
02:52:28.030 --> 02:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
out I don't think they could amend and
 
02:52:31.070 --> 02:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
and they could amend um the warrant
 
02:52:34.830 --> 02:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
article to send Municipal Association
 
02:52:37.309 --> 02:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
less money I mean they could they could
 
02:52:39.389 --> 02:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
they could take out that line at them
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's in the budget by the time you
 
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
get to town meeting it's in the budget
 
02:52:46.630 --> 02:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
and it's Pro probably under the uh
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
selectman's budget most likely and um
 
02:52:53.950 --> 02:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
somebody from the floor can say well I
 
02:52:56.790 --> 02:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
only want to send um New Hampshire
 
02:52:59.429 --> 02:52:59.439 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association half as much and I
 
02:53:02.269 --> 02:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
want to send a message that I enjoy
 
02:53:06.830 --> 02:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
their um legal services and their other
 
02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
programs they have but boy I I don't
 
02:53:11.830 --> 02:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
want to pay for their lobbying somebody
 
02:53:14.670 --> 02:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
on the floor could could make that
 
02:53:16.389 --> 02:53:16.399 align:start position:0%
motion and say I'm going to cut it in
 
02:53:17.950 --> 02:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
half so they don't have any lobbying
 
02:53:20.429 --> 02:53:20.439 align:start position:0%
money and you selectman you better tell
 
02:53:20.439 --> 02:53:21.790 align:start position:0%
money and you selectman you better tell
them

02:53:21.790 --> 02:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
so representative MC yeah MC Carter
 
02:53:29.309 --> 02:53:29.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair low blood
 
02:53:29.319 --> 02:53:30.950 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair low blood
sugar

02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
sugar
 
02:53:34.950 --> 02:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
I so are you suggesting that um a member
 
02:53:37.030 --> 02:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the public a resident in Woodstock
 
02:53:39.910 --> 02:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
for example could uh by warrant article
 
02:53:42.150 --> 02:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
petition town to cut their membership
 
02:53:46.110 --> 02:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
dues in half uh or or some arbitrary
 
02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
figure because it was my understanding
 
02:53:50.550 --> 02:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the fees paid uh by the
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities to the New Hampshire
 
02:53:54.830 --> 02:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association are strictly uh
 
02:53:57.030 --> 02:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
derived from population so can you
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that for me please um it's in
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's in the budget I mean we do have a
 
02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
pink card from the municipal Association
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
may be a good question it's it's
 
02:54:08.950 --> 02:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
pro-rated based on population Manchester
 
02:54:11.070 --> 02:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
pays more than
 
02:54:14.590 --> 02:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
Woodstock um but yes a citizen can put
 
02:54:17.469 --> 02:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
in a petition with 15 signatures if
 
02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's the ratio needed and I think it
 
02:54:22.349 --> 02:54:22.359 align:start position:0%
is in Woodstock I want you to include
 
02:54:24.229 --> 02:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
this warrant article and the warrant
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
article can say anything that's gerain
 
02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:31.560 align:start position:0%

02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
government that we have is a
 
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative government we have a
 
02:55:25.389 --> 02:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional republic so the people
 
02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
vote for their representatives which are
 
02:55:31.550 --> 02:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
all of you sitting here and we expect
 
02:55:33.910 --> 02:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
that you would represent our opinions
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
and our concerns when we contact
 
02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
you as far as I know and as long as I've
 
02:55:43.150 --> 02:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
taught us history um lobbyists were not
 
02:55:45.389 --> 02:55:45.399 align:start position:0%
part of the Constitution
 
02:55:48.790 --> 02:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
and I have sat in many meetings and
 
02:55:51.590 --> 02:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
hearings over the last two years and
 
02:55:53.389 --> 02:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's pretty sad when I'm sitting there
 
02:55:57.429 --> 02:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
and I've taken time out of my day and um
 
02:55:59.309 --> 02:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
I'm the only one there and then there's
 
02:56:01.349 --> 02:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
10 other lobbyist that are there and
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
then I look and I say oh my goodness my
 
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
tax money is paying for them and they're
 
02:56:09.070 --> 02:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
opposing it um recently I was over the
 
02:56:11.830 --> 02:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
education department testifying against
 
02:56:14.229 --> 02:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
obscene books that we are finding in
 
02:56:17.309 --> 02:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
School libraries and my tax money is
 
02:56:20.469 --> 02:56:20.479 align:start position:0%
being used by these lobbyists to say no
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep them in the
 
02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:24.110 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep them in the
schools

02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
schools
 
02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
um this morning on my way here I was
 
02:56:28.990 --> 02:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
listening to Drew Klein who is the chair
 
02:56:30.510 --> 02:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire School Board
 
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
Association he has a nice little morning
 
02:56:37.389 --> 02:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
talk show um he said that New Hampshire
 
02:56:41.190 --> 02:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
has had per cost per pupil has gone up
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
immensely and when he's done research
 
02:56:46.150 --> 02:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
that cost has gone to administrators it
 
02:56:48.190 --> 02:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
is not going to the pupils
 
02:56:51.429 --> 02:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
themselves finally we have um a friend
 
02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
who has been watching this at home and
 
02:56:56.750 --> 02:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
she just now got an email trying to
 
02:56:59.510 --> 02:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
figure out the dues and the fees and
 
02:57:01.389 --> 02:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
going to the New Hampshire school
 
02:57:01.399 --> 02:57:03.030 align:start position:0%
going to the New Hampshire school
administration

02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
administration
 
02:57:06.990 --> 02:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
Association and um it's immense I mean
 
02:57:08.670 --> 02:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
between the superintendent the assistant
 
02:57:11.229 --> 02:57:11.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent the total is over
 
02:57:15.309 --> 02:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
$14,000 and again it's very hard to
 
02:57:18.190 --> 02:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly which is actually
 
02:57:20.670 --> 02:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
going to the New Hampshire school um
 
02:57:23.190 --> 02:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
administrators Association because again
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's not spelled out section by section
 
02:57:28.950 --> 02:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the school board but she was able um
 
02:57:30.389 --> 02:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
the person from the budget committee was
 
02:57:33.309 --> 02:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
able to give her some broad categories
 
02:57:36.229 --> 02:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
and it's $144,000 so we're not talking a
 
02:57:39.990 --> 02:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
hundred or $200 in the school um budgets
 
02:57:42.670 --> 02:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
and um it's a lot of money um the town
 
02:57:45.510 --> 02:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
next to me they just passed um their
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
budget for the deliberative session and
 
02:57:51.150 --> 02:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
their taxes if it gets voted on by the
 
02:57:53.710 --> 02:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
people are going to go up over
 
02:57:57.150 --> 02:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
$1,200 this year they can't afford it
 
02:57:58.309 --> 02:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
even though there was people there
 
02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
saying look I can't pay my taxes I have
 
02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
to choose between taxes and
 
02:58:06.269 --> 02:58:06.279 align:start position:0%
food and they're still spending more
 
02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
money than than the residents have and
 
02:58:10.349 --> 02:58:10.359 align:start position:0%
the lobbyist I think a lot of that is
 
02:58:13.070 --> 02:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
behind that so thank you questions
 
02:58:14.830 --> 02:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
concerns problems sorry that's how I
 
02:58:17.269 --> 02:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
ended every lesson as a teacher it's the
 
02:58:21.229 --> 02:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
teacher in you um representative sellers
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank thank you for
 
02:58:25.790 --> 02:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
my question so I think we heard from the
 
02:58:28.229 --> 02:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
administrator or uh London Dairy or
 
02:58:31.830 --> 02:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
dairy I figet which town but any in any
 
02:58:35.309 --> 02:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
case um so the taxpayers pay the
 
02:58:37.389 --> 02:58:37.399 align:start position:0%
property tax to the town the town gives
 
02:58:41.870 --> 02:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
money to let's you know to a nhma for an
 
02:58:45.110 --> 02:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
example but we also de money to each of
 
02:58:46.830 --> 02:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
the Departments so they can spend money
 
02:58:48.990 --> 02:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
as well and I think we heard from the
 
02:58:52.550 --> 02:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh administrator saying that
 
02:58:54.990 --> 02:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
like the police department will have a a
 
02:58:56.990 --> 02:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
police department Association they give
 
02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
the library has the Ala they give to
 
02:59:02.830 --> 02:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
right so in essence we're not just
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
giving just to one organization we're
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
giving to a lot do you know like how
 
02:59:08.950 --> 02:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
many and about how much a town would
 
02:59:11.950 --> 02:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
actually give or maybe a town that would
 
02:59:14.469 --> 02:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
be a great research
 
02:59:16.830 --> 02:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
proposition I mean it it's it's
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere and um we have to decide as a
 
02:59:21.070 --> 02:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
government and you have to decide as
 
02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives when we come and speak
 
02:59:26.830 --> 02:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
whose voice holds more weight and I
 
02:59:28.990 --> 02:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
would hope that a concerned citizen
 
02:59:30.590 --> 02:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
coming here and speaking to you would
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
hold more weight than somebody that is
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
paid and I am not paid in fact I'm
 
02:59:36.389 --> 02:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
probably getting a parking ticket right
 
02:59:38.550 --> 02:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
now as I'm speaking to you because this
 
02:59:41.150 --> 02:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
one a little longer than I thought so
 
02:59:42.990 --> 02:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
you try to guess when you come here as
 
02:59:44.830 --> 02:59:44.840 align:start position:0%
to how much so we'll see how much my
 
02:59:47.670 --> 02:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill is for today so you try to figure
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
out how long time you take on this end
 
02:59:51.790 --> 02:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
as well you weren't the only place I
 
02:59:53.950 --> 02:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
stopped at today so all right um any
 
02:59:55.710 --> 02:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
further questions so we can get back to
 
02:59:56.750 --> 02:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
the parking
 
02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%

1479 um is very similar and has been

introduced and presented in public

hearings during the past two legislative
 
03:01:10.830 --> 03:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
sessions if I recall correctly each of
 
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
those times the recommendations from the

with the State Attorney General's
 
03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%

03:01:41.910 --> 03:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
such as nhoa receive payments from
 
03:01:43.710 --> 03:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
communities for their code officials to
 
03:01:46.389 --> 03:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
be members of our association and to to
 
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:48.120 align:start position:0%

training the fees for membership to

those associations are currently within
 
03:01:54.670 --> 03:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
annual budgets that the voters review
 
03:01:56.710 --> 03:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
and approve whether it's through town
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
meeting deliberative session or through
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
town or city
 
03:02:02.790 --> 03:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
councils there is a transparent and
 
03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
public process already to approve these
 
03:02:08.670 --> 03:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
funds in each Community within our
 
03:02:12.510 --> 03:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
state nhpa also represents our members
 
03:02:14.910 --> 03:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
by providing input to to legislators on
 
03:02:16.990 --> 03:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
bills that may have a positive or even a
 
03:02:19.150 --> 03:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
negative impact to building and life
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
safety codes in New Hampshire NH hpoa
 
03:02:23.710 --> 03:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
and other professional associations are
 
03:02:26.190 --> 03:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
often requested by legislators to
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
provide input from our members relative
 
03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
to legislative specific to our areas of
 
03:02:35.150 --> 03:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
expertise many smaller communities do
 
03:02:37.590 --> 03:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
not have the staff or resources to have
 
03:02:40.309 --> 03:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
their voices heard and conquered those
 
03:02:42.190 --> 03:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
communities rely on the professional
 
03:02:44.110 --> 03:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
associations to speak speak on their
 
03:02:46.349 --> 03:02:46.359 align:start position:0%
behalf on matters of great
 
03:02:48.309 --> 03:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
importance the many professional
 
03:02:50.190 --> 03:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
associations do not receive funding
 
03:02:52.990 --> 03:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for lobbying nor do they
 
03:02:54.429 --> 03:02:54.439 align:start position:0%
intend to
 
03:02:57.630 --> 03:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
Lobby House Bill 1479 while it may be
 
03:03:00.030 --> 03:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
well- intended to Target specific
 
03:03:02.550 --> 03:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
lobbying expenditures and to provide
 
03:03:04.790 --> 03:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
additional transparency could also have
 
03:03:07.110 --> 03:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
far-reaching negative impacts and
 
03:03:09.469 --> 03:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
ramifications to many very valuable
 
03:03:11.630 --> 03:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
professional associations that help to
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
keep cost from En hamption communities
 
03:03:17.790 --> 03:03:17.800 align:start position:0%
and with that I will take any questions
 
03:03:19.550 --> 03:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um are
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
there questions representative cable
 
03:03:23.950 --> 03:03:23.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:03:25.710 --> 03:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question although I I believe
 
03:03:27.389 --> 03:03:27.399 align:start position:0%
you answered it my my question would be
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
to you uh how much does your Association
 
03:03:34.030 --> 03:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
spend on lobbying efforts um on either a
 
03:03:36.429 --> 03:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
yearly or quarterly basis we do not
 
03:03:39.190 --> 03:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
spend money on lobbying uh efforts are
 
03:03:41.309 --> 03:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
any of our representation that is here
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
is by
 
03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
volunteers follow up thank you Mr chair
 
03:03:48.590 --> 03:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
um by taking a position on as an
 
03:03:50.429 --> 03:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
association by taking a position on a
 
03:03:52.910 --> 03:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
bill that would basically Define
 
03:03:55.269 --> 03:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
lobbyist I I agree with you that and we
 
03:03:56.990 --> 03:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
do our best not to take positions the
 
03:04:00.389 --> 03:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
problem is the the options on our cards
 
03:04:02.950 --> 03:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
here are support or
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:10.030 --> 03:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
neutrality uh just to a point of
 
03:04:12.190 --> 03:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
clarification I have plenty of bills
 
03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
that have no support no nothing checked
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
and we usually say neither supporting
 
03:04:20.910 --> 03:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
nor I will remember that for the future
 
03:04:23.229 --> 03:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
yep good to know rep
 
03:04:25.550 --> 03:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
mccotter thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:04:26.830 --> 03:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question in your
 
03:04:30.590 --> 03:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
testimony today uh you indicated that uh
 
03:04:33.550 --> 03:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
primarily your organization provides
 
03:04:35.950 --> 03:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
education for your membership is that
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
accurate yes do they have an option to
 
03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
select a membership tier that only
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
provides education and there is no
 
03:04:47.990 --> 03:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
lobbying uh Services uh
 
03:04:50.790 --> 03:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
included again we we do not pay for
 
03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
lobbyist um we did it one time many
 
03:04:56.670 --> 03:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
years ago and we stopped that effort and
 
03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
we found it was much better for the
 
03:04:59.830 --> 03:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
legislators to hear from us the code
 
03:05:02.110 --> 03:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
officials ourselves rather than paid
 
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
lobbyists so there's no option to opt
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
out of lobbying because we don't have
 
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
funding for lobby but if I could
 
03:05:13.710 --> 03:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
continue by what we doing by just be
 
03:05:16.110 --> 03:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
being here today someone could say I'm
 
03:05:18.349 --> 03:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
lobbying and that's not my intent my
 
03:05:20.550 --> 03:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
intent is to show that This concerns
 
03:05:23.309 --> 03:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
here that could impact other people then
 
03:05:26.110 --> 03:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll put the target back on nhma
 
03:05:27.269 --> 03:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
because they seem to be the ones you're
 
03:05:29.309 --> 03:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
looking at there's many more
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
associations out there there's the
 
03:05:33.269 --> 03:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
health Officers Association the planners
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
Association that so and it continues
 
03:05:38.750 --> 03:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
that you know they all come to you to
 
03:05:42.349 --> 03:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
proba and guide you one way or the other
 
03:05:46.469 --> 03:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:54.910 --> 03:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:05:58.150 --> 03:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I really enjoyed
 
03:06:01.349 --> 03:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony and I I wish
 
03:06:05.150 --> 03:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
there was a way that we could carve out
 
03:06:07.950 --> 03:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
issues that or pieces that work and
 
03:06:11.070 --> 03:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
pieces that don't but I myself have been
 
03:06:13.229 --> 03:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
on the testifying end of bills on the
 
03:06:17.510 --> 03:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
sponsorship end of bills where
 
03:06:22.469 --> 03:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I'm up against um a
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
lobbying organization and I happen to
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
know that they go directly against um
 
03:06:33.630 --> 03:06:33.640 align:start position:0%
what taxpayers that put me into office
 
03:06:37.870 --> 03:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
want so how do we look at this
 
03:06:40.830 --> 03:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
legislation uh constructively I guess is
 
03:06:43.590 --> 03:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that an interesting or answer able
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
question in your
 
03:06:48.670 --> 03:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
mind I really do wish
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
I I really do wish I had an answer for
 
03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
that and I know you know two years ago I
 
03:06:54.670 --> 03:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
worked with a sponsor on a bill that was
 
03:06:57.790 --> 03:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
similar to this and we attempted to try
 
03:07:00.710 --> 03:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
and find a way that you know those
 
03:07:03.070 --> 03:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
associations that are you know trying to
 
03:07:03.080 --> 03:07:03.990 align:start position:0%
associations that are you know trying to
provide

03:07:03.990 --> 03:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:07:06.990 --> 03:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
information um and again even by
 
03:07:09.070 --> 03:07:09.080 align:start position:0%
providing information could you could
 
03:07:11.070 --> 03:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
you say we're trying to sway your your
 
03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
Vote or your decision or your your um a
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
position on a bill I guess yes but I
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
think it's for you to decide on bills
 
03:07:21.389 --> 03:07:21.399 align:start position:0%
you should hear both sides of the story
 
03:07:24.510 --> 03:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
um and hear from all parties um whether
 
03:07:27.429 --> 03:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
there's pros or cons and then you should
 
03:07:28.910 --> 03:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
make your
 
03:07:28.920 --> 03:07:31.630 align:start position:0%
make your
decision

03:07:31.630 --> 03:07:31.640 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
followup thank you uh thank you for
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question again if you would um
 
03:07:37.630 --> 03:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
isn't that what the hearing processes
 
03:07:41.190 --> 03:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
for to listen to both
 
03:07:45.190 --> 03:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:48.670 --> 03:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
lobbyists I I do agree however when you
 
03:07:50.750 --> 03:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
get into the associations if we if we're
 
03:07:53.630 --> 03:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
here at the hearings are we being
 
03:07:56.190 --> 03:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
lobbyists you know and that's I think a
 
03:07:57.710 --> 03:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous area to get into and I think
 
03:07:59.910 --> 03:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
it comes down to that the definition of
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
what a lobbyist is doesn't carve out
 
03:08:06.070 --> 03:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
professional associations as an as an
 
03:08:10.469 --> 03:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:10.479 --> 03:08:12.030 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:16.030 --> 03:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
reper thank you thank you for being here
 
03:08:18.309 --> 03:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted
 
03:08:22.110 --> 03:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
to um ask a question is
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
that this is my first term in the state
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%

um during our legislative
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
orientation um rep Stephen Smith advised
 
03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
us that lobbyists were a good thing and
 
03:08:42.950 --> 03:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't um as new represent
 
03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
resentatives we shouldn't admonish their
 
03:08:48.510 --> 03:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
presence and and um listen to what they
 
03:08:59.110 --> 03:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
aware um rep

sers thank you Mr chair and going on rip

hopson's question is do you have any
 
03:09:16.590 --> 03:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
ideas or any thoughts on how we could
 
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
separate uh or um exempt certain

03:09:34.710 --> 03:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
others again two two years ago I worked
 
03:09:36.070 --> 03:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
with the sponsor from this bill to try
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
and come up with some language that
 
03:09:39.950 --> 03:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
could do that but it's very difficult
 
03:09:42.229 --> 03:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to do and I don't know
 
03:09:44.229 --> 03:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
what the parameters ERS would be to
 
03:09:46.630 --> 03:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
determine what professional association
 
03:09:48.950 --> 03:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
is exempt from the lobbying other than
 
03:09:51.070 --> 03:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
to rewrite the definition of what a
 
03:09:51.080 --> 03:09:54.150 align:start position:0%
to rewrite the definition of what a

Dary opposes the bill from New Hampshire

good hi my name is Joan dargy and the
 
03:10:40.590 --> 03:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
town clerk in Milford and I'm the
 
03:10:43.389 --> 03:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
legislative co-chair for the New
 
03:10:45.389 --> 03:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire City and town clerks
 
03:10:48.550 --> 03:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
Association um I'm here today um to
 
03:10:51.950 --> 03:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill um for many of the
 
03:10:54.750 --> 03:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
reasons that have already been said um
 
03:10:57.429 --> 03:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
the city and town clerks uh each town we
 
03:11:01.630 --> 03:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
get dues of $20 from from each of our
 
03:11:05.870 --> 03:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
city and our towns um we Engage The
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
Services of demur and prol and I'll tell
 
03:11:11.469 --> 03:11:11.479 align:start position:0%
you in a election year this year that we
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
have four elections
 
03:11:16.870 --> 03:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
um looking at a thousand plus lsrs is a
 
03:11:19.070 --> 03:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
little daunting and thank goodness we
 
03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
have we engage them to do that for us
 
03:11:23.830 --> 03:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
they kind of pair it down and then we
 
03:11:26.190 --> 03:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
are able to focus on those bills that
 
03:11:29.269 --> 03:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
are that are important to us um one
 
03:11:31.309 --> 03:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
thing I did want to mention is that as
 
03:11:34.630 --> 03:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
what Mr mckenny just um spoke to we were
 
03:11:38.670 --> 03:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that um If This Were to pass
 
03:11:40.590 --> 03:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
that as part of the New Hampshire City
 
03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
and town clerks Association if we came
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
to Lobby we to testify on a bill that we
 
03:11:47.590 --> 03:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
would be considered a lobbyist and
 
03:11:50.910 --> 03:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
therefore would not be able to do that
 
03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
um I think that everything else has been
 
03:11:55.229 --> 03:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
said and if anybody has any questions I
 
03:11:58.030 --> 03:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
welcome any questions thank you very
 
03:12:00.830 --> 03:12:00.840 align:start position:0%

representative sers is that
 
03:12:07.389 --> 03:12:07.399 align:start position:0%
oh oh it's just a automatic move I think
 
03:12:10.670 --> 03:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
um muscle memory um I do have one
 
03:12:13.269 --> 03:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
question um
 
03:12:13.279 --> 03:12:14.870 align:start position:0%
question um
you

03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%

they bring your
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
feelings um as lobbyists here or are
 
03:12:33.750 --> 03:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
they just identifying bills that are are
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
um something that you should be aware of
 
03:12:37.469 --> 03:12:37.479 align:start position:0%
90% of the time that's what they're
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
doing um it's when we are not available
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
to be to test or something that we might
 
03:12:48.510 --> 03:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
ask them to um speak on behalf of us
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh do you also engage
 
03:12:54.870 --> 03:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives directly we do yeah on
 
03:12:57.550 --> 03:12:57.560 align:start position:0%
occasion yeah okay but it's not always
 
03:12:58.710 --> 03:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
that easy
 
03:13:01.030 --> 03:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
to access the
 
03:13:03.229 --> 03:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
representatives um you know that are
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
specific to a bill so um we do what we
 
03:13:12.990 --> 03:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
can I see um last question I have is um
 
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
were you aware of of the existing law um
 
03:13:19.830 --> 03:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
asking for the delineation of State
 
03:13:23.309 --> 03:13:23.319 align:start position:0%
funds not to be used for so I believe
 
03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
that um probably most city and towns do
 
03:13:28.910 --> 03:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
this but they're separated by a general
 
03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
ledger account so I know that if we
 
03:13:33.750 --> 03:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at up in Milford how many
 
03:13:36.110 --> 03:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
what is the total of State funds that
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
were received we could do that but not I
 
03:13:40.389 --> 03:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it would be in a separate
 
03:13:45.550 --> 03:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
bank account it does require that oh so
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe there it's not just a
 
03:13:50.110 --> 03:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
book entry it it does have to be but it
 
03:13:51.710 --> 03:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
could be and I'll look back I can check
 
03:13:53.469 --> 03:13:53.479 align:start position:0%
back at finance and check on that as
 
03:13:55.990 --> 03:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
well great I I believe without speaking
 
03:13:58.990 --> 03:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
for the for the sponsor I believe that's
 
03:14:03.309 --> 03:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
part of this is to bring light to light
 
03:14:06.309 --> 03:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
um the idea that there are existing laws
 
03:14:08.510 --> 03:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
and and some of those I think by his
 
03:14:10.590 --> 03:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
letter to the attorney general is
 
03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
indicating that um he doesn't believe
 
03:14:15.229 --> 03:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
many are following the existing law so
 
03:14:16.830 --> 03:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
right I mean it would be easy enough to
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
separate the funds I mean what we
 
03:14:22.030 --> 03:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
collect is $20 from each city or town
 
03:14:24.150 --> 03:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
and nhma out of all the town funds I
 
03:14:25.510 --> 03:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
mean they it's like a
 
03:14:28.349 --> 03:14:28.359 align:start position:0%
$1,200 fee plus or minus depending on
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
the population right yeah thank you very
 
03:14:32.590 --> 03:14:32.600 align:start position:0%

has been around for 49 years we
 
03:15:12.150 --> 03:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
obviously have uh plenty of pieces of
 
03:15:14.590 --> 03:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
leg legislation that we follow and track
 
03:15:17.710 --> 03:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
we do have we do uh have a lobbyist that
 
03:15:20.950 --> 03:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
we do use because currently right now we
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
are tracking monitoring 700 bills and
 
03:15:26.670 --> 03:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
100 and 103 in addition to that are top
 
03:15:29.070 --> 03:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
priority obviously affecting the multi
 
03:15:31.349 --> 03:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
multitude of departments within the
 
03:15:33.150 --> 03:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
county as you know you're all members of
 
03:15:35.830 --> 03:15:35.840 align:start position:0%

annually uh we have always actively
 
03:15:49.710 --> 03:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
participated in the legislative process
 
03:15:52.510 --> 03:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
I would say 95% of the time our members
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
are the ones who come and vote come and
 
03:15:56.790 --> 03:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
vote I'm sorry come and testify before
 
03:16:00.950 --> 03:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature uh and it's not likely
 
03:16:05.950 --> 03:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
that our uh our lobbyist comes to um
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
unless it's nobody can actually get here
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
or it's a the 11th Hour possibly
 
03:16:13.630 --> 03:16:13.640 align:start position:0%

about what's in the best interest and
 
03:16:34.070 --> 03:16:34.080 align:start position:0%

03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
that we send to testify are the ones who
 
03:16:38.750 --> 03:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
are the experts in the field whether
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%

03:16:46.269 --> 03:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
a multitude you know uh the nursing home
 
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
obviously is the biggest department the
 
03:16:51.510 --> 03:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
most costly department and you know
 
03:16:55.070 --> 03:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes legislation is proposed
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
that isn't to me totally um thought
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
through because there's you know
 
03:17:05.950 --> 03:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
consequences to many bills that they
 
03:17:08.030 --> 03:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been thought out and they don't
 
03:17:11.590 --> 03:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
understand how it will affect the county
 
03:17:11.600 --> 03:17:13.670 align:start position:0%
understand how it will affect the county
um

03:17:13.670 --> 03:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:15.950 --> 03:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned as an elected
 
03:17:18.990 --> 03:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
official who gets paid by County funds
 
03:17:21.030 --> 03:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
that when I appear before any committee
 
03:17:23.630 --> 03:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
under this piece of legislation I can be
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
subjected to a class A
 
03:17:28.990 --> 03:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor right my finance director or
 
03:17:32.110 --> 03:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
possibly my Treasurer um can be subject
 
03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
to a class A misdemeanor because he
 
03:17:35.349 --> 03:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
signs the checks and it's County funds
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
that pay me um I don't have you know
 
03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
obviously I've been told uh that I could
 
03:17:43.870 --> 03:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
appear here person personally well the
 
03:17:45.790 --> 03:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
problem with that is if I'm I guess if
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm taking a vacation day but I still
 
03:17:49.710 --> 03:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
get paid for vacation time right through
 
03:17:52.269 --> 03:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
County funds uh you don't meet on
 
03:17:54.429 --> 03:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
Saturdays or Sundays so I certainly
 
03:17:55.510 --> 03:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't come up here and say I'm
 
03:17:57.750 --> 03:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
meeting I'm coming up here to testify as
 
03:18:01.189 --> 03:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
a person and not as an elected official
 
03:18:02.670 --> 03:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
because that's what I am an elected
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
official and I do Lobby and I do Lobby
 
03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
locally with my own reps I did two weeks
 
03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
ago with regards to this piece of
 
03:18:11.070 --> 03:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
legislation when my executive committee
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
met to and we discussed this and I gave
 
03:18:15.590 --> 03:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
them actually the handout that I gave
 
03:18:18.910 --> 03:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
you and discussed you know um my
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts um on this on this piece of
 
03:18:24.030 --> 03:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I've also spoken to my nine
 
03:18:26.229 --> 03:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
I'm from the town of Salem and I've
 
03:18:27.950 --> 03:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
spoken to my nine State reps with
 
03:18:31.630 --> 03:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
regards this legislation as well um I
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
feel it's my obligation to um you know
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
if I have something that is is NE it's
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
going to negatively affect especially my
 
03:18:43.630 --> 03:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
office you will see me up here
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
testifying be to to give you the
 
03:18:50.070 --> 03:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
information as to why why it would be
 
03:18:52.389 --> 03:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
either beneficial or you know in
 
03:18:55.389 --> 03:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
opposition to our to the best interest
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the Deeds office you know
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%

03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
things that people don't understand that
 
03:19:12.189 --> 03:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
we do but we play a significant role and
 
03:19:14.710 --> 03:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
there are a significant amount of bills
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
that are proposed each year that affect
 
03:19:19.870 --> 03:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
County government County tax dollars you
 
03:19:22.189 --> 03:19:22.199 align:start position:0%

taxpayers to to your job you're doing
 
03:21:26.030 --> 03:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
because some taxpayers don't want
 
03:21:29.229 --> 03:21:29.239 align:start position:0%
lobbying some do I understand that but
 
03:21:32.070 --> 03:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
as I said I mean when I when I come up
 
03:21:34.510 --> 03:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
here to discuss a piece of legislation
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to be something that's going
 
03:21:38.070 --> 03:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
to be beneficial one way or the other to
 
03:21:40.349 --> 03:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
the people who utilize my office I've
 
03:21:42.030 --> 03:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
also been approaching I have also Al
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
written legislation that's been proposed
 
03:21:48.630 --> 03:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
conquer pres no representative
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
payer hi thank you for being here um in
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
in your experience when you've come in
 
03:21:59.870 --> 03:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
and and spoken to different groups and
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
whatnot and then there's been
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
votes would you say that majority rules
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
so even if there's a vote and the
 
03:22:11.550 --> 03:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
majority votes in a certain way then
 
03:22:13.590 --> 03:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
that even though the the minority may
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
not be getting what they want that
 
03:22:18.750 --> 03:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
democracy has occurred appropriately oh
 
03:22:20.309 --> 03:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the association of
 
03:22:22.630 --> 03:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
counties sure okay so with the
 
03:22:24.389 --> 03:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
association of counties my legislative
 
03:22:26.389 --> 03:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
group is about 90 people we meet every
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
Friday afternoon to talk about
 
03:22:30.630 --> 03:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
legislation uh and then it goes to the
 
03:22:31.910 --> 03:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
executive committee if we have a piece
 
03:22:34.990 --> 03:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
of legislation that multip you know one
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
or another county is opposed to and
 
03:22:39.950 --> 03:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
others are in favor of we do not lob it
 
03:22:42.229 --> 03:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
we don't he ends off if they want to
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
come up and they want to lobby for
 
03:22:45.750 --> 03:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
something that's up to them but we do as
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
an association do not get
 
03:22:48.720 --> 03:22:50.429 align:start position:0%
an association do not get
involved

03:22:50.429 --> 03:22:50.439 align:start position:0%
involved
 
03:22:52.590 --> 03:22:52.600 align:start position:0%

03:22:55.309 --> 03:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
questions and Pearson thank you Mr chair
 
03:22:57.550 --> 03:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
just for just for clarification on what
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
you just said so so the action that the
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
association of counties takes um when it
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
does Lobby is on actions that the the
 
03:23:09.750 --> 03:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
board goes through the process of coming
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
out unanimous correct okay okay thank
 
03:23:17.550 --> 03:23:17.560 align:start position:0%

03:23:20.830 --> 03:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
are the are the individual counties also
 
03:23:23.790 --> 03:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
members of um New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
Association the only County I'm aware of

that is an affiliate member is suvin
 
03:23:30.110 --> 03:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
County that's the only County and I
 
03:23:32.309 --> 03:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
think that then they had get no advocacy
 
03:23:35.110 --> 03:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
from nhma it's basically for legal
 
03:23:37.229 --> 03:23:37.239 align:start position:0%
assistance and things like that but they
 
03:23:40.389 --> 03:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
nhma does not Lobby for any County okay
 
03:23:43.189 --> 03:23:43.199 align:start position:0%

you please enter and sign in please um
 
03:24:12.510 --> 03:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
here to oppose the bill from nhma
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair n gra for the
 
03:24:16.309 --> 03:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
municipal Association as I hope you all
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
understand from Context we oppose this
 
03:24:20.990 --> 03:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um one of the services we
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
provide our members is when they care
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
deeply about legislation we do deliver
 
03:24:28.429 --> 03:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
those letters to committees uh
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of what our policy positions
 
03:24:33.229 --> 03:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
are on those letters as you'll see from
 
03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
the folders that you are now passing
 
03:24:39.429 --> 03:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
around there are 35 letters from Members
 
03:24:41.590 --> 03:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
35 different members all of whom were
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
opposed to this legislation um I do have
 
03:24:47.790 --> 03:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
one small correction to my uh my letter
 
03:24:49.590 --> 03:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's in there which is that I listed
 
03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
32 but I got three more yesterday so we
 
03:24:55.070 --> 03:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
have small towns like Fremont large ones
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
like londonairy you''ve heard from from
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
numerous other ones today um but my
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
letter does summarize most of those it
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't have Auburn Salem or Swansea
 
03:25:06.189 --> 03:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
because I received those
 
03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday um seems like the committee
 
03:25:11.710 --> 03:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
had a number of questions um I guess the
 
03:25:13.950 --> 03:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
first point I really want to make is
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
that the bill in front of you has some
 
03:25:19.590 --> 03:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
pretty vague language in it um with
 
03:25:23.150 --> 03:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
respect to the chair we have discussed
 
03:25:25.349 --> 03:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
the bill language uh with the four
 
03:25:27.630 --> 03:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
attorneys in our office and we all agree
 
03:25:30.950 --> 03:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
that it is contrary to 155 if we were to
 
03:25:32.670 --> 03:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
provide legal advice to any member
 
03:25:34.389 --> 03:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
calling us about whether they could
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
testify in their official capacity we
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
would warn them that they may in fact be
 
03:25:42.750 --> 03:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal penalty
 
03:25:47.229 --> 03:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
um there are additional concerns we have
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
as well um there is a provision in there
 
03:25:52.349 --> 03:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
about being allowed to provide
 
03:25:56.030 --> 03:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
information um I don't think I need to
 
03:25:58.030 --> 03:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
say this but I'm going to anyway which
 
03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
is that it should be pretty clear based
 
03:26:02.229 --> 03:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
on the testimony you've already received
 
03:26:04.590 --> 03:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
today that we're opposed to this bill
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
even if I were never to say opposed and
 
03:26:08.030 --> 03:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
I got up and just listed a bunch of
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
things I don't like about it it's pretty
 
03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
clear we're opposed to the bill same
 
03:26:13.550 --> 03:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
thing if we had a bill that we liked get
 
03:26:15.150 --> 03:26:15.160 align:start position:0%
up and say three things about it that I
 
03:26:17.950 --> 03:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
like again we would like that bill to
 
03:26:21.070 --> 03:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
pass the word oppose or support is not
 
03:26:23.550 --> 03:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
in our view magical it's actually the
 
03:26:25.710 --> 03:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
context of the conversation that
 
03:26:28.189 --> 03:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
occurs and that's what we would be
 
03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
obviously concerned about um and you
 
03:26:34.510 --> 03:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
know there has been some talk today
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
about uh about our organization and how
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
it functions I just want to be clear
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
that we're a voluntary nonprofit
 
03:26:42.640 --> 03:26:44.229 align:start position:0%
that we're a voluntary nonprofit
nonpartisan

03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
03:26:46.550 --> 03:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
organization we have a policy setting
 
03:26:48.670 --> 03:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
conference that I believe Mr Karen
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
described uh very accurately um that
 
03:26:55.510 --> 03:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
policy setting conference is done with
 
03:26:56.990 --> 03:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
our members they tell us what they want
 
03:26:59.750 --> 03:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
us to Advocate on support oppose it
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
occurs every two years while all of you
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
are knocking on doors for re-election um
 
03:27:05.910 --> 03:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
our members are meeting to decide what
 
03:27:07.389 --> 03:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
we should advocate for over the next
 
03:27:10.510 --> 03:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
two-year period and then based on that
 
03:27:12.750 --> 03:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
um we we go out and we support bills or
 
03:27:16.269 --> 03:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
oppose bills um we also obviously track
 
03:27:18.189 --> 03:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
what members like and sometimes members
 
03:27:21.269 --> 03:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
request things that we're not sure uh
 
03:27:23.309 --> 03:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
how they fit under our policy positions
 
03:27:26.309 --> 03:27:26.319 align:start position:0%
so just to give you an example um
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's a there were one member
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
requested this year a change to the
 
03:27:31.670 --> 03:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater withdrawal processes that
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
Bill's been heard later today in
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
resources and wreck um we actually had
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
to go to our board for further Direction
 
03:27:40.150 --> 03:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
because we knew that was going to impact
 
03:27:41.590 --> 03:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
another member and we wanted wanted to
 
03:27:42.750 --> 03:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that we weren't going to
 
03:27:45.189 --> 03:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
advocate for something that was harm to
 
03:27:46.790 --> 03:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh another
 
03:27:48.910 --> 03:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
municipality um I think the committee's
 
03:27:52.110 --> 03:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
also had some questions on 155 and um
 
03:27:55.269 --> 03:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
segregation of funds uh that applies to
 
03:27:57.309 --> 03:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
lobbyists we do follow the law as it
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
exists now um and I guess the last point
 
03:28:03.870 --> 03:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
I really want to make but I'm certainly
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions is that uh
 
03:28:10.269 --> 03:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
actually two other points I'm sorry um
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of questions
 
03:28:14.110 --> 03:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
about fiscal notes and how those happen
 
03:28:16.030 --> 03:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
um honestly that question is best
 
03:28:17.550 --> 03:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
reserved for the legislative budget
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
assistant um from my perspective what
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
happens is we sometimes receive requests
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
for information from the legislative
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
budget assistant yes it does have
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
information that I'm not allowed to
 
03:28:30.870 --> 03:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
disclose which may or may not be a draft
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
of a bill um but I'm thoroughly warned
 
03:28:36.030 --> 03:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not allowed to disclose that and
 
03:28:37.189 --> 03:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
what they're interested in is any
 
03:28:39.070 --> 03:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
information we can provide on financial
 
03:28:40.429 --> 03:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
impacts whether that's going to increase
 
03:28:41.710 --> 03:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
revenues whether that's decreased
 
03:28:44.469 --> 03:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
revenues whatever that is it's the
 
03:28:45.870 --> 03:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
instructions are very strict that you're
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
not supposed to Advocate on that I
 
03:28:49.269 --> 03:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
understand that obviously if there is a
 
03:28:51.510 --> 03:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal note written that could be
 
03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
advocacy they uh they have their own
 
03:28:56.269 --> 03:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
internal processes I have zero control
 
03:28:57.910 --> 03:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
over what they ask me for information
 
03:29:00.269 --> 03:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
for if any state agency asks me for
 
03:29:02.189 --> 03:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
information whether it's the LBA whether
 
03:29:05.910 --> 03:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's the es whether it's you know uh do
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
whoever it is and I have that
 
03:29:08.590 --> 03:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
information or I can direct them
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
correctly just as I would do for any
 
03:29:13.269 --> 03:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
legislator I will direct you to that um
 
03:29:15.590 --> 03:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I do if you'd like to
 
03:29:17.790 --> 03:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
change that process and remove us from
 
03:29:19.790 --> 03:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
that process that's totally up to you
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's not something we do that's
 
03:29:24.750 --> 03:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
internal to LBA and what they do um I
 
03:29:27.189 --> 03:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
just ask that you talk to them about it
 
03:29:31.550 --> 03:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and the last point is um we do think
 
03:29:34.429 --> 03:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
that it's a fundamental right to speak
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
to the government and we think that it's
 
03:29:39.550 --> 03:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
really important that uh that our
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
members are able to um petition the
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
government and they use us as
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
essentially the microphone for that um
 
03:29:50.070 --> 03:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
or the megaphone for that we uh we we do
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
what they ask us to do and um we come
 
03:29:54.990 --> 03:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
before you with their positions whatever
 
03:29:55.950 --> 03:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
those may
 
03:30:00.910 --> 03:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
be and realistically uh you know they
 
03:30:02.910 --> 03:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
can't always make it here and it's
 
03:30:04.590 --> 03:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
frankly not always a good use of
 
03:30:07.070 --> 03:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money to pay for three
 
03:30:08.590 --> 03:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
different elected officials from three
 
03:30:09.950 --> 03:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
different towns to come here when they
 
03:30:11.870 --> 03:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
could just send me instead
 
03:30:15.550 --> 03:30:15.560 align:start position:0%
um it's just cheaper for everybody um
 
03:30:19.189 --> 03:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
and so we we do oppose this bill um you
 
03:30:20.670 --> 03:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
know I think that the the government
 
03:30:23.070 --> 03:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
does have a right to speak um and that's
 
03:30:25.389 --> 03:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
what we we support we believe that's
 
03:30:27.150 --> 03:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional we believe that's a
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
fundamental right under the
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution happy to take questions
 
03:30:33.790 --> 03:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh for your
 
03:30:36.990 --> 03:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um rep walls have a question I
 
03:30:38.670 --> 03:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
hope you can hear
 
03:30:43.510 --> 03:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
me sorry um I have a couple of questions
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
um municipalities can decide whether or
 
03:30:50.349 --> 03:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
not to participate as members of nhma
 
03:30:52.630 --> 03:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
correct correct and we've had in the
 
03:30:56.870 --> 03:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
past decade I think it is Salem and um I
 
03:30:58.189 --> 03:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
believe the other one was marac were're
 
03:31:00.510 --> 03:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
not members for a period of time um
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
there was a shift in our policies based
 
03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
on our member input and they decided to
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
rejoin follow up thank you and
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities can contact you if they
 
03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
don't agree with legislation absolutely
 
03:31:15.750 --> 03:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
as I said at the beginning you know we
 
03:31:17.469 --> 03:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
if they don't like legislation but they
 
03:31:19.469 --> 03:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
want us to deliver a letter and say Hey
 
03:31:22.110 --> 03:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know we know nhma is opposed but we
 
03:31:24.429 --> 03:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
support it or vice versa we do that
 
03:31:26.590 --> 03:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
that's a service we provide final
 
03:31:29.870 --> 03:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
question final question how often do you
 
03:31:31.950 --> 03:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
hear from commun entities who are
 
03:31:36.510 --> 03:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
unhappy with what nhma is
 
03:31:39.070 --> 03:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
representing not very frequently because
 
03:31:40.950 --> 03:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
of our policy setting process that they
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
they're all involved in um typically
 
03:31:44.710 --> 03:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
what happens if they have a bill that
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
they're very passionate about um so I'll
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
throw the town of Conway under the bus
 
03:31:51.429 --> 03:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
here the town of Conway is very
 
03:31:52.750 --> 03:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
passionate about doing something with
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
Hotel occupancy fees that we don't have
 
03:31:57.030 --> 03:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
a specific policy position on that we
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
advise them to participate in the next
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh this upcoming policy process to see
 
03:32:03.189 --> 03:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
if you know that's something that they
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
could help use us for and we could we
 
03:32:08.150 --> 03:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
could do more uh advocacy on and they
 
03:32:10.510 --> 03:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
are going to participate in that so
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:32:16.389 --> 03:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
perer hello thank you for being here um
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the packet that you passed out I see
 
03:32:21.710 --> 03:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
there's a letter from the town of
 
03:32:24.990 --> 03:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
Fremont that opposes this bill and and
 
03:32:26.710 --> 03:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
CC to
 
03:32:30.750 --> 03:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
representative yella the last uh
 
03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the letter States HB 1479
 
03:32:36.229 --> 03:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
threatens the core concept of local
 
03:32:39.030 --> 03:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
control can you do you have any thing
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
that you could elaborate about that
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely the uh as this committee has
 
03:32:48.670 --> 03:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
heard extensively today the decision to
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
join or not join nhma or any other
 
03:32:53.670 --> 03:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
organization that then comes here and
 
03:32:56.189 --> 03:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
speaks to all of you is something that's
 
03:32:57.630 --> 03:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
decided the local level through the
 
03:33:01.229 --> 03:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
transparent budget process uh any voter
 
03:33:04.950 --> 03:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
in any municipality has the option to
 
03:33:07.269 --> 03:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
work through that process to say hey I
 
03:33:09.309 --> 03:33:09.319 align:start position:0%
don't want our town to be a member of
 
03:33:11.790 --> 03:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
this organization and and as I've given
 
03:33:13.349 --> 03:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
you examples they've done that in the
 
03:33:16.229 --> 03:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
past because they have not agreed um and
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
so by taking that that voice away from
 
03:33:21.990 --> 03:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
government um by taking that away from
 
03:33:24.990 --> 03:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
the people you know that loses the
 
03:33:27.309 --> 03:33:27.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have people like me come
 
03:33:29.349 --> 03:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
here and say hey if you pass this
 
03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
legislation there's going to be some
 
03:33:34.590 --> 03:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
sort of impact on your your uh the
 
03:33:37.189 --> 03:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of your town is what we talk
 
03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
about a lot we talk about you know we
 
03:33:40.830 --> 03:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
want state aid we want additional money
 
03:33:42.590 --> 03:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
or if this legislation might have some
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
sort of requirement requires towns to do
 
03:33:47.070 --> 03:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
something it's going to cost a million
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
dollars a town or whatever it is we we
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:55.469 --> 03:33:55.479 align:start position:0%
out uh I just want to I should have done
 
03:33:59.550 --> 03:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
this earlier um we are to ask clarifying
 
03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:01.150 align:start position:0%
this earlier um we are to ask clarifying
questions

03:34:01.150 --> 03:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
um rather than
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
um well I'll just leave it at that um
 
03:34:07.560 --> 03:34:08.710 align:start position:0%
um well I'll just leave it at that um
rep

03:34:08.710 --> 03:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
rep
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
costable thank you thank you Mr chair
 
03:34:12.910 --> 03:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for taking my question
 
03:34:14.990 --> 03:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
so I we've had conflicting information
 
03:34:17.670 --> 03:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
I've had both in public here today in
 
03:34:19.870 --> 03:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
this testimony and privately have been
 
03:34:22.670 --> 03:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
told that this is not about the
 
03:34:25.189 --> 03:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
information or the general services that
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
you guys provide that they they they
 
03:34:29.269 --> 03:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
like but they don't want to the towns
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
may not want to participate in the
 
03:34:34.910 --> 03:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying efforts and that there are um
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
the people Town's people can go to their
 
03:34:40.950 --> 03:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
meetings and pull out the funding but
 
03:34:43.389 --> 03:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
the the way I'm understanding it is that
 
03:34:46.550 --> 03:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
this is uh there's no mechanism to pull
 
03:34:48.269 --> 03:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
out lobbying efforts especially if
 
03:34:50.429 --> 03:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
you're not segregating what what you're
 
03:34:52.910 --> 03:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
spending on lobbying or not so is there
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
a process to be a part of your
 
03:34:59.070 --> 03:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
Association and not pay for lobbying
 
03:35:02.710 --> 03:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
efforts so our dues are calculated based
 
03:35:04.670 --> 03:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
on population and assessed value and
 
03:35:07.590 --> 03:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
there's a formula for that um and it's
 
03:35:09.750 --> 03:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
just you either pay to join or you don't
 
03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
join that's that's the way it works um
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
if you don't have to join um and
 
03:35:19.830 --> 03:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
certainly again we have an open process
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
that members participate in to tell us
 
03:35:26.910 --> 03:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
what to advocate for so um that's that's
 
03:35:27.990 --> 03:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
how it
 
03:35:32.269 --> 03:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
works follow up thank you Mr chair um
 
03:35:35.110 --> 03:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
are you opposed to segregating Lobby
 
03:35:38.349 --> 03:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
funds is is is the lobbying effort
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
compared to say what what a lot of the
 
03:35:42.870 --> 03:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh local select board and then they they
 
03:35:45.990 --> 03:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
really like the the the lawyer inputs on
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
on some of the stuff and that that has
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with specific bills and um
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
is is are you saying that it's
 
03:35:56.710 --> 03:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
essential to come here and Lobby on
 
03:35:59.150 --> 03:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
bills as part of your Association like
 
03:36:01.110 --> 03:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
are you completely opposed to separating
 
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
a Lobby fund and what gets paid towards
 
03:36:05.950 --> 03:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying and then having it something
 
03:36:09.389 --> 03:36:09.399 align:start position:0%
separate so here's how why we can't do
 
03:36:11.389 --> 03:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
that because I don't know if you guys
 
03:36:13.229 --> 03:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
are going to run on time or not and so
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
if I'm supposed to keep track of my
 
03:36:16.750 --> 03:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
hours as I do and re-report that to the
 
03:36:18.429 --> 03:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and that's
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
available I don't know how much of my
 
03:36:24.630 --> 03:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
salary to Bill to lobbying versus the
 
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
other four jobs that I have providing
 
03:36:29.269 --> 03:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
legal advice doing trains Etc I only
 
03:36:32.110 --> 03:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
know that after the fact so I don't know
 
03:36:36.150 --> 03:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
in January June 15th comes am I going to
 
03:36:38.229 --> 03:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
spend 600 hours here I'm going to spend
 
03:36:39.990 --> 03:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
700 hours here how much time am I going
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
to spend here and unfortunately this
 
03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
isn't a shift job I mean if everything
 
03:36:47.349 --> 03:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
ran on time I'd love to come in talk for
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
15 minutes build that out and leave that
 
03:36:50.830 --> 03:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
would be really easy we could figure
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
that out but that's not the way this
 
03:36:55.189 --> 03:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
works I have to sit here for as long as
 
03:36:57.229 --> 03:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
these hearings take so I can come up and
 
03:36:58.630 --> 03:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
answer questions and provide the
 
03:37:01.790 --> 03:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
information I can provide um and at we
 
03:37:03.950 --> 03:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
do the quarterly reports um we do
 
03:37:05.189 --> 03:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
everything else so you see that in
 
03:37:07.349 --> 03:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
retrospect we we just can't predict how
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
long it's going to take we can't predict
 
03:37:10.030 --> 03:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
how many bills are going to affect
 
03:37:12.670 --> 03:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
municip alties that we to spend time on
 
03:37:15.750 --> 03:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
um so I I just can't do
 
03:37:17.830 --> 03:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:37:20.269 --> 03:37:20.279 align:start position:0%
lter thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:37:23.710 --> 03:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you explain to
 
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
me a circumstance where it would be a
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate for every town in a county
 
03:37:33.550 --> 03:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
to belong to your
 
03:37:36.750 --> 03:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
organization through dues but also the
 
03:37:40.030 --> 03:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
county as a whole belongs to that same
 
03:37:42.030 --> 03:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
organiz ganization so the taxpayers are
 
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
paying twice can you explain why that
 
03:37:46.630 --> 03:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
would be a appropriate circumstance so
 
03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
we have both our full memberships which
 
03:37:51.349 --> 03:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
are cities and towns and then we have
 
03:37:53.469 --> 03:37:53.479 align:start position:0%
associate memberships which are counties
 
03:37:56.990 --> 03:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
Village districts um we provide
 
03:37:59.670 --> 03:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
different services so we don't advoc we
 
03:38:01.349 --> 03:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
only Advocate on behalf of cities and
 
03:38:03.189 --> 03:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
towns we do not Advocate on behalf of
 
03:38:07.550 --> 03:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
counties or Village districts um we but
 
03:38:09.469 --> 03:38:09.479 align:start position:0%
what the associate membership gets them
 
03:38:11.150 --> 03:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
is they can come to our trainings we do
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of trainings that overlap with
 
03:38:15.790 --> 03:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
kind of the same laws that counties need
 
03:38:17.229 --> 03:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
and the counties Association doesn't
 
03:38:18.550 --> 03:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily do the same type of
 
03:38:21.429 --> 03:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
trainings but for example in Coos County
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
um there number of
 
03:38:26.429 --> 03:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
um uh I don't remember the name of but
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's the county planning that
 
03:38:31.429 --> 03:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh planning board that occurs up there
 
03:38:32.670 --> 03:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
so they need to know what the land use
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
statutes are we provide that training it
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make sense for the
 
03:38:37.990 --> 03:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
County's associ Association to provide
 
03:38:40.349 --> 03:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
that as much because we do that with
 
03:38:44.269 --> 03:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
with 234 cities and towns so different
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
Services mostly the training side of
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
things is what they're what they're
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
accessing and again that's all voluntary
 
03:38:52.150 --> 03:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
so you could always choose not to have
 
03:38:54.189 --> 03:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
your county join if that's what you're
 
03:38:54.199 --> 03:38:55.269 align:start position:0%
your county join if that's what you're
interested

03:38:55.269 --> 03:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
interested
 
03:38:58.510 --> 03:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
in followup followup question thank you
 
03:39:00.030 --> 03:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's actually not a followup to this
 
03:39:01.309 --> 03:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
but it's a followup to something you
 
03:39:03.870 --> 03:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
said a little while ago um in your
 
03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
testimony you said something to the
 
03:39:07.750 --> 03:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
effect I want to make sure I understand
 
03:39:11.070 --> 03:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
your position about uh the government
 
03:39:13.269 --> 03:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
having free speech and I I don't think
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
you intended to mean that the
 
03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
constitution protects a government's
 
03:39:18.030 --> 03:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
right to free speech because it does not
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
provide for that as you're probably well
 
03:39:22.510 --> 03:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
aware well I think there's a right to
 
03:39:25.229 --> 03:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
petition the government and I think that
 
03:39:26.830 --> 03:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
you know when a group of people get
 
03:39:29.110 --> 03:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
together they inform an organization and
 
03:39:30.590 --> 03:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
that organization can petition the
 
03:39:32.670 --> 03:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
government on behalf of those people uh
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that's a fundamental right
 
03:39:39.229 --> 03:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:39.239 --> 03:39:41.269 align:start position:0%

nhna not off the top of my head but I
 
03:39:54.030 --> 03:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
could get that information for you thank
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
you for a followup yes uh do you know
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
what the total revenues do you oh first
 
03:40:00.990 --> 03:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
of all do you get other revenues besides
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
the city and towns and counties do you
 
03:40:06.150 --> 03:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
get any private revenues any other
 
03:40:08.229 --> 03:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
revenues from Big corporations or
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
anything else like that or corporations
 
03:40:12.750 --> 03:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
General anything so our our entire
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue the vast majority of it is
 
03:40:19.110 --> 03:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
membership dues and then local officials
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
come to our training some of those they
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
have to pay for some of those are free
 
03:40:24.630 --> 03:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
those paid ones are obviously also paid
 
03:40:28.110 --> 03:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
for by the cities and towns um and then
 
03:40:31.309 --> 03:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
we sometimes have uh sponsorships of
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
trainings in order to offset some of the
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
costs so like our annual conference we
 
03:40:38.590 --> 03:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
have I don't know like four different
 
03:40:40.590 --> 03:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
law firms and and some other entities
 
03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
that sponsor that and they get little
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
booths um and kind of standard stuff I
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
don't know what the breakdown is but I
 
03:40:51.229 --> 03:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
can follow up please yep yeah just for
 
03:40:54.389 --> 03:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
clarity um I'm just wondering do you get
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
other monies from outside of government
 
03:40:56.720 --> 03:40:58.309 align:start position:0%
other monies from outside of government
how's

03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
how's
 
03:41:01.309 --> 03:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
that only in the context I just gave you
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
like like a law firm can't just give us
 
03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
a check for $1,000 we would not do that
 
03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's not they have to have some
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
relationship to what we're doing
 
03:41:10.160 --> 03:41:11.229 align:start position:0%
relationship to what we're doing
representative

03:41:11.229 --> 03:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
payer okay I'm going to need your help
 
03:41:16.110 --> 03:41:16.120 align:start position:0%

03:41:17.910 --> 03:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
I'll be listening
 
03:41:21.189 --> 03:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
okay can you I'm just curious can you
 
03:41:23.149 --> 03:41:23.159 align:start position:0%

03:41:27.550 --> 03:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
your background of your education to
 
03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:31.520 align:start position:0%

so I'm an attorney I was originally
 
03:41:36.229 --> 03:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
hired to work in the legal services side
 
03:41:38.309 --> 03:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
of things and I was not previously a
 
03:41:40.510 --> 03:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
municipal attorney I was actually a a
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutor for uh several small towns um
 
03:41:45.910 --> 03:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm an attorney uh so I have a a law
 
03:41:49.229 --> 03:41:49.239 align:start position:0%
degree um learned Municipal laot uh
 
03:41:51.630 --> 03:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
worked with cities and towns to train
 
03:41:55.189 --> 03:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
them over the few years and then uh my
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
the person who had this role before me
 
03:41:59.229 --> 03:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
he retired and the position opened up
 
03:42:01.990 --> 03:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
and I was selected how many years have
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
you been doing this work as an
 
03:42:06.670 --> 03:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
attorney like how many years have I been
 
03:42:08.389 --> 03:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
an attorney I'm sorry many I have been
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
an attorney for I think 11 years now 12
 
03:42:13.950 --> 03:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
2013 is when I was sworn to the party
 
03:42:17.630 --> 03:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
sorry low blood sugar sorry M know what
 
03:42:19.590 --> 03:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's like rap
 
03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
costable thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
you again for taking my question can you
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
um shed some light on how the
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
association comes to decisions um based
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
on membership keeping so um and with
 
03:42:38.070 --> 03:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
with in the context of um representative
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
next to me lives in a large town town
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
I'm in a very small town uh so the the
 
03:42:46.110 --> 03:42:46.120 align:start position:0%
money coming in is is
 
03:42:48.510 --> 03:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
disproportionate um so how do you
 
03:42:50.830 --> 03:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
balance the let's say rural
 
03:42:52.830 --> 03:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities versus the cities where
 
03:42:55.990 --> 03:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
the cities are paying far much far
 
03:42:59.590 --> 03:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
greater to to the association than say
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
the rural how do you protect the rural
 
03:43:03.990 --> 03:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities sure so thank you for the
 
03:43:06.429 --> 03:43:06.439 align:start position:0%
question we're obligated to represent
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
everyone to the best of our ability so
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
when there are uh clear divide so for
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
example in the education debate whether
 
03:43:16.590 --> 03:43:16.600 align:start position:0%
there's donor towns or not donor towns
 
03:43:18.030 --> 03:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's something we can't get involved
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
in because it it divides municipalities
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
so we try as much as possible to make
 
03:43:24.030 --> 03:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
sure and as I gave you the example
 
03:43:26.990 --> 03:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
earlier with the uh brwater withdrawal
 
03:43:29.110 --> 03:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
processes we had to go back to our board
 
03:43:31.469 --> 03:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
for that because we said look the the
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
context in which this came up was um one
 
03:43:36.389 --> 03:43:36.399 align:start position:0%
town was concerned because the town next
 
03:43:38.910 --> 03:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
door was drawing was drilling a large
 
03:43:38.920 --> 03:43:40.670 align:start position:0%
door was drawing was drilling a large
well

03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether that's going to
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
cause some sort of conflict we can't be
 
03:43:46.110 --> 03:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
in a position of pitting Town against
 
03:43:48.990 --> 03:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
Town um so we had to talk with our board
 
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
to see what our position would be on
 
03:43:55.269 --> 03:43:55.279 align:start position:0%
that bill if any um and so we try to
 
03:43:56.590 --> 03:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that when there's that
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
conflict we we don't get involved in
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
those because that's we need to
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
ability my turn um so my my first
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
question is is there somewhere we can go
 
03:44:17.189 --> 03:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
um or can you provide for us a list of
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
all of your clients
 
03:44:22.830 --> 03:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
Beyond um the cities and towns I don't
 
03:44:24.429 --> 03:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
have any clients other than cities and
 
03:44:27.189 --> 03:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
towns you mean like well associate
 
03:44:29.950 --> 03:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
members and everything yeah I I can
 
03:44:31.950 --> 03:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
follow up with you on that yes that' be
 
03:44:31.960 --> 03:44:33.550 align:start position:0%
follow up with you on that yes that' be
great

03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:44:36.910 --> 03:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
um then I have a question of um I asked
 
03:44:39.030 --> 03:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor earlier and I would
 
03:44:42.630 --> 03:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
like your opin opinion um on the idea of
 
03:44:45.790 --> 03:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
whether this legislation and
 
03:44:48.309 --> 03:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
maybe um some of the existing
 
03:44:51.910 --> 03:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislation might be in a in incorrectly
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
placed within the lobbyist section
 
03:44:57.710 --> 03:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
rather than in the cities and towns and
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
what money can be spent on U within that
 
03:45:03.389 --> 03:45:03.399 align:start position:0%
cities and town
 
03:45:05.670 --> 03:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
section I'm not sure I follow I'm sorry
 
03:45:09.030 --> 03:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
Mr CH so so um the idea that money can
 
03:45:11.229 --> 03:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
only be it in here there are
 
03:45:13.870 --> 03:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
specifications of where money can uh
 
03:45:16.830 --> 03:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
what state funds can be done with in
 
03:45:20.110 --> 03:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
order to purchase lobbying
 
03:45:22.870 --> 03:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
Services we had an example earlier where
 
03:45:26.870 --> 03:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
it may be that um the lobbying firm may
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
not have any idea where the funding is
 
03:45:33.510 --> 03:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
coming from to pay their services so I'm
 
03:45:37.870 --> 03:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
asking whether um for purposes of
 
03:45:40.269 --> 03:45:40.279 align:start position:0%
location maybe this is in the the weeds
 
03:45:44.790 --> 03:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
but should um the the exemptions or the
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
exceptions of of what can be purchased
 
03:45:50.670 --> 03:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
with state or local funds should that be
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
in the section on cities and towns not
 
03:45:55.710 --> 03:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
in the section on
 
03:45:58.349 --> 03:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
lobbyists well chapter 15 applies to
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
lobbyists which would apply to me does
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
not apply to cities and towns so if
 
03:46:05.790 --> 03:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
you're contemplating a different change
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
as to what Authority cities and towns
 
03:46:11.070 --> 03:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
have that may be appropriate somewhere
 
03:46:15.630 --> 03:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
else versus what my role is right okay
 
03:46:18.710 --> 03:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
um won't Bel labor that
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
um I think I you you answered the
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
question about whether um
 
03:46:28.750 --> 03:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
funding could be withheld from a city or
 
03:46:31.389 --> 03:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
town if they chose not to have lobbying
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
services that that and you said that
 
03:46:38.429 --> 03:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
that could not be done correct correct
 
03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and and the last question I have is
 
03:46:46.349 --> 03:46:46.359 align:start position:0%
the the formula that you have for um for
 
03:46:46.359 --> 03:46:49.149 align:start position:0%
the the formula that you have for um for
charging

03:46:49.149 --> 03:46:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:54.510 --> 03:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
premium uh how is it that um um pick two
 
03:46:58.830 --> 03:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
towns London Derry and meramac um are
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
they aren't there aren't there services
 
03:47:05.950 --> 03:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
that they're receiving the same um
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
within regardless of their their
 
03:47:10.189 --> 03:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
population are
 
03:47:14.550 --> 03:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
um is it not true that um their ability
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
to ask you legal questions or do
 
03:47:18.910 --> 03:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
training or any of those things is the
 
03:47:21.870 --> 03:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
same regardless of their Town population
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
so our dues are calculated on population
 
03:47:28.349 --> 03:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
and assessed value
 
03:47:31.630 --> 03:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
obviously it pertains to our budget
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
because you have to pay for staff so if
 
03:47:36.950 --> 03:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
all towns were to pay the same amount as
 
03:47:38.830 --> 03:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
Freedom paid we probably wouldn't be
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
able to have a staff because that's just
 
03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
not a very high number um so that budget
 
03:47:47.990 --> 03:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
is set by our board of directors which
 
03:47:50.870 --> 03:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
is comprised of local officials so
 
03:47:52.590 --> 03:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
they're the ones Who oversee that if you
 
03:47:54.269 --> 03:47:54.279 align:start position:0%
want more information about how that
 
03:47:55.750 --> 03:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
process works and everything I can
 
03:47:57.309 --> 03:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
certainly ask my executive director to
 
03:48:00.149 --> 03:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
follow up are all the associate members
 
03:48:03.550 --> 03:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
the same rate or are they also by that
 
03:48:05.790 --> 03:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
formula I don't know that off the top of
 
03:48:07.469 --> 03:48:07.479 align:start position:0%
my head I do know Village districts used
 
03:48:10.590 --> 03:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
to be a set rate of I think 500 a year I
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's true for counties
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if that has changed
 
03:48:15.990 --> 03:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay but I will follow up with that
 
03:48:20.189 --> 03:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
information I'm told it's in there um
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
anybody up representative mcarter real
 
03:48:27.510 --> 03:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
quick I thank you Mr chair um so are you
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that a town say like dairy or
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
London Dairy larger population uh higher
 
03:48:34.080 --> 03:48:35.030 align:start position:0%
London Dairy larger population uh higher
property

03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
values um and then compare us into a
 
03:48:41.950 --> 03:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
town like Freedom new Hamp sure um are
 
03:48:44.790 --> 03:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
they able to access the same level of
 
03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
service do they get prioritized because
 
03:48:50.630 --> 03:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
they pay a higher dues or everybody gets
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
access to the same information or
 
03:48:55.630 --> 03:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
resources that your organization uh
 
03:48:57.630 --> 03:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
provides regardless of population or
 
03:49:01.229 --> 03:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
dues we don't change like everybody can
 
03:49:03.469 --> 03:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
call our Legal Services we just have our
 
03:49:05.950 --> 03:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
