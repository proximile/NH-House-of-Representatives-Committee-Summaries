00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
10:05 G to open the public hearing on HB
 
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
650 and we'll intro we'll welcome up Dan
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
Maguire who was already sitting in his
 
00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
seat thank you very much Mr chairman
 
00:08:28.749 --> 00:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan Maguire I represent the
 
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
town of Epsom and uh I've had the
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
privilege for the last two years to be
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
the chair of a committee called The
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
Joint Committee on dedicated funds and
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
among our members is you yourself Mr
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
chairman and your ranking member behind
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
me here and um this is a really
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
interesting committee where uh basically
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
we we um review all the dedicated funds
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
that the state has on a five-year cycle
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
so um every every year we look at 20% of
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds we look at how much
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
is in the funds what's the law behind
 
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
them um has anything changed are they
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
getting too big too small that sort of
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
thing and so it's it's mostly just sort
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
of administrative uh kind of stuff but
 
00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
but it is interesting and you and you
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
get to learn a lot about sort of the
 
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes stuff in state
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
government the sort of off the books
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff and things like that and
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
so one thing we do every year is um of
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
the funds that we examine we look for
 
00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
changes that the law needs to make them
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
current and to and to make them uh
 
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
continue to work and so this is this is
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
a this year we created two bills one is
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
the one that you yourself sponsored um
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with um the cleanup of of RSA 6
 
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
colon 12 and all the the lists of funds
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
and so on but this bill is sort of the
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
the remaining uh cleanup it's it's not
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
quite technical corrections but it's you
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
know the next closest thing um and so
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
the things we identified this year as
 
00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.190 align:start position:0%
the things we identified this year as
needing

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
needing
 
00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
change um one is there were two
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that were still in the
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 6 colon 12 list but their Associated
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
law had already been repealed so that's
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
the two repeals in section five of this
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
bill uh one other one was the robotics
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
fund so the legislature has been given
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
um robotics education about
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
$750,000 a year that goes into a
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and that dedicated fund
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
goes to high schools it gives grants to
 
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
high schools for for robotics activities
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
and um that fund was sort of
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
growing you know they weren't using the
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
full 700 50,000 they were using less and
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
so one thing we recommend is that we put
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
a cap on the fund of a million dollars
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
to uh and and the rest would go back to
 
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
the general fund if if there's an excess
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
and um the way we came up with the
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh was basically Senator
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
Gray's um suggestion because it it
 
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:28.519 align:start position:0%
removes any problems with timing right
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
so if the money from the general fund
 
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
goes into the fund at any particular
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
time in the year and money comes out at
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
some other time during the year the fund
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
will always have enough so that there's
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
never a timing issue right so so that's
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
the that's where that comes from and the
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
other one that we found was this um
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
Canon Mount the the parks fund so it
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
turns out that the parks
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
department um they have one giant
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund that they sort of run
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
their whole department on and and they
 
00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
kept two separate um accounts within
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
that fund one for the winter activities
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
at the Canon Mountain ski area and one
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
for everything else in the Parks right
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
and so it just seemed like this this
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund was kind of overused and
 
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
and so this this language will create
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
two an extra another dedicated fund
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
specifically for the Canam Mountain
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
winter activities and to keep it
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
separate from the rest of what's going
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
on in the Parks it doesn't really change
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
how they operate it's just more of an
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
accounting thing where it'll be easier
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
to see the two different activities
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
separately and I'm happy to answer any
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
questions representative y uh thank you
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representing
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
Maguire um first of all online
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
is that a uh typographical error rather
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
than $1 billion that's $1
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
million under the American uh numbering
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
system that is the last comma should be
 
00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:17.069 align:start position:0%
system that is the last comma should be
a

00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.069 --> 00:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
period well there's the word and right
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
so I personally don't like commas before
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
and but it's it seems like it's um
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's a scrier error
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we we'll accept it as that uh
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
another question Mr chair go ahead uh
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
would you consider this to be a
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
housekeeping type of a bill to clean up
 
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.030 align:start position:0%
housekeeping type of a bill to clean up
some

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:43.240 align:start position:0%
messes like I said thank you for the
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
question but like I said earlier it's
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's maybe just this side of
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
housekeeping right because the robotics
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
thing you can't think of as housekeeping
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an actual policy kind of
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
thing but but it's pretty close to that
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes and one last question and would you
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
have any objection if this bill were
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
exec today uh
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
no thank you sir thank
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman my committee is meeting
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to have to leave thank you
 
00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:18.519 align:start position:0%
for coming before and I hope you get us
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh house resolution what is it 11 ASAP
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
you you'll get it
 
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
soon uh before I before I bring up the
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
next uh guest I I'll I was remiss in

introducing my wife who was sitting in
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%

sure this this is her first time in the
 
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office Building um despite
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
that I've been a state rep for well I'm
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
going to my fifth term she has been at
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
the state house and she has been at
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
house session um before but I wanted to
 
00:14:57.069 --> 00:14:57.079 align:start position:0%
welcome her and introduce her to
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
everyone so round of applause to our
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%

Aly official uh
 
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh suseli city of
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
Lebanon on I wanted to follow up a
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
little bit on this uh represent Maguire
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
had told me that I needed to present it
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
because he couldn't come so I'm glad he
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
was able to be here
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
um there there is a policy issue in the
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
state parks fund uh but it it really is
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
a cleanup also the state parks fund uh
 
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
was these two groups uh the all the
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
activities not just winter of the Winter
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
Ski Area including the
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
Tramway uh and then every other Park in
 
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.509 align:start position:0%
Tramway uh and then every other Park in
the

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
system and every other Park in the
 
00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
system has have been having a great
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
amount of difficulty in raising funds
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
um the uh historic
 
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
houses I can't remember exactly what
 
00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959 align:start position:0%
it's called but the historic
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
houses uh
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund um because they can do
 
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.790 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund um because they can do
visitor

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
visitor
 
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
chores and they put it all in one bucket
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
and the rest of the
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
parks are um we'll have a a uh donation
 
00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:05.959 align:start position:0%
box out somewhere that people can put
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
money in but that's that's it and it
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
goes to that particular Park rather than
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
to all of them so they're having
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
maintenance problems but it this at
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
least makes the problem more obvious and
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh something can be done about
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
that and I wanted just for the people
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
who uh were're here with nor major who
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
know that he started the
 
00:17:32.559 --> 00:17:34.070 align:start position:0%
know that he started the
robotics

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
robotics
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
fund um I've talked with him I explained
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
to him why we're doing this uh it is it
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
was set up so that it was only to
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
establish robotics teams in different
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
schools they seem to be running out of
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
schools that are capable of doing that
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
or interested in doing that so um we've
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
cut back the amount of money in there it
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
can be increased again if all of a
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
sudden the really small schools can do
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
the same thing or something like that so
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
uh that's what's going on with that he
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
understands that so um that's all I
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
really wanted to add to this okay thank
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
you does anyone have any questions for
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%

week by mistake as well so yes and that
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
and that will be corrected um we we are
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
not going to have another public hearing
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%

into executive commy since we have 15
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
minutes for the next meeting it would be
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
very appropriate and since we have
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%

650 I'm a little worried
 
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.830 align:start position:0%
650 I'm a little worried
about

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.320 align:start position:0%

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
know right that's a
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
risk drive a motorcycle I never worry
 
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.470 align:start position:0%

you oh didn't get that it's interesting
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
being on this side of the
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh the desk but um anyways U you all
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
know who I am but for the record I'm
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
representative John janigian
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
representing Rockingham District 25
 
00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:37:45.069 --> 00:37:45.079 align:start position:0%
Salem HP 585 is attempting to solve a
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
problem for small churches and small
 
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.630 align:start position:0%
problem for small churches and small
religious

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
religious
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
organizations uh if you look at RSA
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
7223 paragraph 3 it lists what
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
properties exempt from property taxes
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that is exempt is
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
a church
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
parsonage um and for example it's but
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's only tax exempt if the pastor lives
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
in that parsonage and um however if it's
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
rented out then it now potentially
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
subject to the local property tax so I'm
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
going to give you a real life example um
 
00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:24.200 align:start position:0%
and you all have a copy of my testimony
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
now my church is is the arat Armenian
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
congregation Church in Salem New
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's one of many small
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
churches in the town of
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
Salem um and we used to have a full-time
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
Pastor that lived in the parsonage
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
building um and it's a it's a the
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
parsonage was a three-bedroom house and
 
00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
it was detached from the church but but
 
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
right next door and as our congregation
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
became smaller uh we eventually could
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
not afford a full-time pastor and went
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
on to having a part-time Pastor who was
 
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
living in his own house so so now we're
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
not using the parsonage anymore the
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
assessor became aware of that and
 
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
started taxing that property and while
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily taxed at full
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
valuation we are paying roughly $4,000 a
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
year so um it's kind of a double whammy
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
as we're as we're membership has has
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
gotten smaller um we we also now have to
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
pay a property tax so many small
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
churches are facing this same scenario
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
and um and that's really impetus to this
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
bill um I want to point out that um the
 
00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
bill also allows a church to rent out
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
space in their main worship building to
 
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:41.720 align:start position:0%
raise money for um Church operations or
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
church Outreach um when it's rented to
 
00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
other religious organizations it's not
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
an issue um there's no potential
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
property tax implication however um if
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
you rent it out in the example I give
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
the testimony as you rent it out to a
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
daycare now that potentially could
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
trigger the assessor to say okay we have
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
to partially tax uh this property now
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
because you're it's not just religious
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
purposes so what this bill tries to do
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
is it's it in an attempt not to just
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
have it does two things in an attempt
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
not to have churches just start um you
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
know renting out all sorts of buildings
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
and making money off them that money has
 
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
to be used for paying the pastor church
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance or uh standard Church uh
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
programs and I'm using the word church
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
but this bill is written in a way to
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
cover U you know synagogues mosques you
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
know other religious organizations my
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
example is a church but you'll see if
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
you look at the context of the bill it
 
00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
covers um different religions as well
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
and um and the other thing it does is it
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
tries to eliminate so if it's a large
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
religious organization that has many may
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
have many parentage may have many
 
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
buildings they can't just start renting
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
them all out to whoever and and and and
 
00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
taking that money for anything it's
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
limited to one parsonage and one main CH
 
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
worship building that way not giving
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
large organization's ability to to go
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
wild with this it limits it but it helps
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
small organizations as well so um with
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
questions r your microphone sorry any
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
opal thank you madam chairman sounds
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
sounds good to say that um and and thank
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
you representative um we had a similar
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
situation in in Canan and I'm I'm
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
wondering in in the case of this church
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
they were renting or they they were
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
using the parsonage for their music
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
director um as opposed to the the pastor
 
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
who had had his own home um and the
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
assessor suggested that that was
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
contrary to the RSA and they should be
 
00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
should be taxed I'm I'm wondering is
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
there any definition anywhere in the
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
statutes that defines standard
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
religious um it
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
programs um I'm not sure but that
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
phraseology was is used um
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
I'd have to check but I believe that
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
phraseology was is used somewhere else
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the statutes and that that's why we
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
used it um that's why the the drafting
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
attorney used it follow up just I I'm
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
just um just to avoid situations like
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
your own and and the the one we faced in
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
Canan I'm just I'm just admit perhaps
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
there's um maybe we could do some
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
research on this I I would support this
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
bill absolutely but I'm wondering if
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
there's if not language in the rsas if
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
there's Court precedent or something
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
that um legislative Services
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
could yes I that's a good point I I I
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
agree with you we should make sure that
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's solid because we're using that
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
phraseology we we don't want it to be
 
00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
open to interpretation that can throw it
 
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
off well and I get I'm
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
sorry based on the situation in Kanan
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
where the assessor was saying having the
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
musical director living in the parsonage
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
was somehow not standard Rel you know
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
what I think I'm stuck here until we
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
have so I just thank you for that yeah I
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
mean actually now that you just said it
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
that way regardless of of this the the
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
fact that it somebody other than the
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
pastor can be in there would actually
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
cover that so I think I think in that
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
covered any other
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
repr thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
for taking my question question actually
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
two one is a technical question and that
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
is is there a fiscal note anywhere
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
attached to this do we have any idea of
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact it there should be no
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact because this is Town Town
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
taxation okay thank you and a separate
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
question the in lines 5 six and seven
 
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
you talk about regularly recognized and
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
constitu constituted
 
00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
denomination there are lots of very
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
large religious organizations and there
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
are also some really tiny ones who does
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
the recognizing I mean if I wanted to
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
open and I'm going to deliberately be
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
silly here if I wanted to open up a
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
church uh to worship the oak tree in my
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
backyard and I got 20 people to say that
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like a great idea I mean just how
 
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
are we
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
defining or who is defining what a
 
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.230 align:start position:0%
defining or who is defining what a
regularly

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
recognized that's a good question I I
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
don't know who's defining it but at the
 
00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:00.109 align:start position:0%
don't know who's defining it but at the
same

00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
time you know going down that same
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
example you could potentially try to get
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
a a tax exemption for that and so
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
whatever governs that sort of situation
 
00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
would would kind of be the same okay
 
00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:17.589 align:start position:0%
would would kind of be the same okay
thank

00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.599 --> 00:45:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
thing

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative or thank you madam chair
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
can I can I just say I'm so used to
 
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
orang so I don't know if you have any
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
experience with this but having been an
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
elder in the church uh we had to present
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
like a uh the
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
bulletin a list of the itinerary what
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
what the church functions were so I
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
would assume as a an ongoing Church
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
Fellowship you have those sort of things
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
and I think by federal
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
law that's what's going to determine
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're an ongoing
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually functioning church is that
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
something do you have any idea
 
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
recollection of that or well we we do
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
have uh Church bylaws that Define how
 
00:46:10.109 --> 00:46:10.119 align:start position:0%
the church operates what its structure
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
is and uh what its Duties are in each in
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
each area yeah because I believe Federal
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
you represent Balon
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um regarding uh a
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
GU Salem's due diligence on how they
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
determined that part of the property was
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
um Revenue making and did the assessor
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
periodically just you know come by and
 
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
different conditions for the church and
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
the the parsonage I mean how was it
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
discovered did you report
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
or that's that's a good question I I
 
00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
don't remember uh we've been actually
 
00:46:58.839 --> 00:46:59.870 align:start position:0%
don't remember uh we've been actually
paying

00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
this um it's been it's been years um and
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
what triggered what triggered this was
 
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
and I think um one of the people
 
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
testifying later is going to talk to is
 
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
um that last year the assessor uh and
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
and assessors from several towns started
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
um assessing Church property um because
 
00:47:26.589 --> 00:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
they were making and I'm not sure what
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
those was based on but they were I know
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
in Salem it was
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
if you had a church property and you
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
weren't using anything out and I'm just
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
I don't remember the exact number now
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
but if you're not using the land outside
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
of let's say 200 feet and don't quote me
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
on that then we will tax everything
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
outside that area and that created a big
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
problem in s we went to the um the Town
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
Council um there was a process to kind
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
of reverse that but that triggered the
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
idea that why you know you know why why
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
are we taxing some of these things we
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
should be better taxed I so I the answer
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
to your question is I don't know how
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
they discovered that um but you'd have
 
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
the same and and so that could be the
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
concern my my guess is your your
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
followup would be then how are they
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
going to know if the money is being used
 
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
for paying the minister and so forth but
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
follow it's it's the same it's the same
 
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
issue of not knowing you know are they
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
yeah there there's those sort of things
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
that make it difficult to
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
determine okay I as a followup I was
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
just going to describe the fact that I
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
am putting a bill in to uh do payment
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
low of taxes for nonprofits but um P or
 
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
the um churches are exempt from that
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
bill so but I just wanted to get it out
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
there that the spill might be coming
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
down the pike thank you any further
 
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.789 align:start position:0%
down the pike thank you any further
question

00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
questions and I've got a couple of
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this on First on in Kan not
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
in Kanan in uh Grafton town uh there was
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
a man who put up a church uh in a place
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
that had been a church uh and declared
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
it a
 
00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
church and I can't remember on
 
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:27.559 align:start position:0%
representative spar seems to remember
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
this I can't remember what the outcome
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
of that was but I know that it was
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
contested for quite a while
 
00:49:39.789 --> 00:49:39.799 align:start position:0%
um and uh but second I really think we
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
ought to set our researcher Gen 4 onto
 
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
looking as how this has been handled in
 
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
the past and that it really is also a
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
local issue it should have had an L on
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
it uh and ought we ought to to consult
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
the municipal and County
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee about it and now I have
 
00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:10.789 align:start position:0%
committee about it and now I have
spurred

00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh excuse me
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
for not having been here earlier it was
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
a family issue medical um the question
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
that I have is regarding as an
 
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
organization shall not claim more than
 
00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
one exemption under this sub paragraph I
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
understand what you're trying to say a
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
particular Parish however the parishes
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
both the Episcopalian Church and the
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
Lutheran Church and the Catholic church
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
and are all part of one larger
 
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
organization which has multiple churches
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
apply we may need to look at that um you
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
know because we we want to make sure
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
large church that that isn't made up of
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
little Parts doesn't take advantage of
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
this you know we're trying to we're
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
trying to I think you understand the
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
intent of it so if there's some question
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh with that that's something we could
 
00:51:16.349 --> 00:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
on yeah the I was also remember the um
 
00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
Eastern Orthodox dasis has or patriarchy
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
has uh several churches in in the state
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
as well so it it it covers a large a
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
large number of main mainstream churches
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
as well as the individual smaller
 
00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
churches uh so I I do think that
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
maybe some tweaking is needed sir thank
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts one question one more question
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um was there any uh besides
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
the assessor did you approach any of the
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
local folks the select board or anything
 
00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:04.109 align:start position:0%
local folks the select board or anything
about

00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
this um we for the thing that happened
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
last year we did we brought it to the
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
Town Council and they directed The
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
assessor to
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
reconsider um and um because this $4,000
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
that I just mentioned here that we pay
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
every year it had been you know uh
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
almost doubled and so we did get that
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
reversed this but all what I'm saying is
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
it prompted me though to look back and
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
say why you know look at this part of
 
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
the law and
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
say yes we we can't afford to have a
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
pastor live in this parsonage but now
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
that we we're renting it out we're being
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
taxed on it but we're actually still
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
using the money to pay the pastor and
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance thank you if there are no
 
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
maintenance thank you if there are no
other

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
then I thank the representative for
 
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
speaking and call on thank you former
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
gay I'm Betty gay from Salem former
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative and a church member All
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
My Life um and now actually a member of
 
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.270 align:start position:0%
My Life um and now actually a member of
two

00:53:28.270 --> 00:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
churches it's federal law that a church
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
usually has to use to prove that they
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
are a
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
501c3 so the town doesn't usually have
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
to figure that one out
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
um this whole issue came up a couple of
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
years ago when we had a substitute
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
assessor who actually had been the
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
assessor for Salem several years before
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
went off to greener pastures and then
 
00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
came back as a quote temporary well two
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
years after he was there
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
temporarily he joined with uh apparently
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
he adopted the opinion by other
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
assessors that you could make points if
 
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
you could bring in more tax money so
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
they were Stu this was a movement across
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
the state and if you know about it when
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
it happened in your town we could get an
 
00:54:22.829 --> 00:54:22.839 align:start position:0%
idea how when did that happen but it's
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
really recent uh you know two years
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
three at the most um and he was a a
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
member of a church and uh he was very
 
00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:37.400 align:start position:0%
unembarrassed to think that it was okay
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
to tax
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
churches uh because he very strictly
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
interpreted the line here that's on line
 
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
five directly for religious training or
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
for other religious purposes by any
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
regularly recognized and constituted
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
denomination so he went with a really
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
strict interpretation that it's not
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
religious to enjoy grounds around your
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
building in in when he was dealing with
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
St David's and Triumph and cross it was
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
like at the edge of the building that
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
was taxable and he went to every single
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
Church in town walked it with the
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
minister Triumph and cross was able to
 
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
um what do you call where you bury you
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
you bury the the uh ears or you spring
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
scatter the ashes that was considered a
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
cemetery that's not taxable so St D
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
Triumph cross went well we missed that
 
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
St David's rents out it's very small
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
Church uh has Wetland has trees has
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
grass and a small congregation and he
 
00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:01.720 align:start position:0%
decided that you could tax wetlands and
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
trees and a little bit of most of the
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
grass but you could save a little bit of
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
the grass for people doing something
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
outside it was just to the point of
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
ridiculous saying that you know Outdoors
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with the the Ambiance
 
00:56:21.549 --> 00:56:21.559 align:start position:0%
if that's appropriate word of being
 
00:56:21.559 --> 00:56:23.069 align:start position:0%
if that's appropriate word of being
there

00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
um uh uh Grace
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
Grace Church has lots of trees lots of
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
wetlands right next door to triumphant
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
cross that had the the U cem the
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
cemetery they got taxed on all of it and
 
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
I friends couldn't believe that they
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
were taxing Wetland of all things you
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
know so it was just to the point of
 
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that churches were being
 
00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.789 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that churches were being
taxed

00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
taxed
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
anyway and uh in the case
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
of uh the church that I grew up in St
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
Michaels in Lamar Texas the dasis
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
decided pisc church the dasis decided
 
00:57:09.029 --> 00:57:09.039 align:start position:0%
that it was not a good idea to keep
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
providing uh homes for the ministers
 
00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
because when they retired they didn't
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
have any property so they changed over
 
00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
and said you need to buy to to buy
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
property and I Remember Mama telling me
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
that the priest told her his hands shook
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
because in those days that was a long
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
time ago $1,000 was a lot to pay and he
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
said his hand shook as he wrote his ,000
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
check every month but that meant that a
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
whole lot of churches ended up owning
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
property that they still needed to pay
 
00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.309 align:start position:0%
property that they still needed to pay
the

00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
minister but now so they had the extra
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
expense and now you know you need the
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
income from the property that you
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
already invested in so to me this is
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
just a really sensible way to address
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
the issue that many many churches have
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
you've invested in the property you own
 
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
it but you need to pay your minister his
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
housing allowance in cash so why not
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
take it from the property that you
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
already own to me it's not fair at all
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
that right now the churches are having
 
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions would
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
you take questions oh of course I any
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions because it's fun to
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
talk I miss being a
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
rep okay yeah I've seen you on the
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
internet quite a lot and not as much
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
lately so um there don't seem to be any
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much just vote
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
well and we now have um someone in
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
opposition uh Brad Dees deis I can't
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
remember D sorry from uh the municipal
 
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
Association thank you uh Madam
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and thank you to the
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee for letting me speak today my
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
name is Bry Dees I represent the ner
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and I am speaking
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
in opposition to um this is House Bill
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
585 um for just as our general position
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
um we are against the expansion of tax
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions or credits that are mandated
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
onto the municipalities and this would
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
um do that and especially when it's
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
property that could have commercial uses
 
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
or uses not in line with uh religious um
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
with the religious Doctrine or
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
charitable P purposes claimed under RSA
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
7223 that would be uh reported to the
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
assessor or the contract assessor to the
 
00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:57.150 align:start position:0%
assessor or the contract assessor to the
municipality

00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
um I also want to mention there was some
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
discussion about assessors becoming you
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
know a Statewide movement as to being
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
more strict in their application of RSA
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
72 colon 23 for charitable and religious
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
tax exemptions um this was born out of a
 
01:00:14.029 --> 01:00:14.039 align:start position:0%
decision made by the uh the New
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of tax and land appeals
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
the btla um which exists with the
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
Authority Under RSA 71-b colon 5 they're
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
over on South Fruit Street so about mile
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
that way um so their decision is the
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
reason why some assessors were a lot
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
stricter with how they interpreted this
 
01:00:32.349 --> 01:00:32.359 align:start position:0%
some were a little bit looser some were
 
01:00:33.789 --> 01:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
so loose that it was not in line with
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
the law and the btla said you need to be
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
assessing these properties by Statute um
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
I will also mention there's a near
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
identical bill um not entirely the exact
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
verbiage but essentially the same
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
substance and that would achieve nearly
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
the same thing that was heard yesterday
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
in front of Municipal and County
 
01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
government um it's house bill
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
425 and um so that kind of creates some
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
complexities where we have two bills
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve very similar things
 
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:06.520 align:start position:0%
slightly different ways and slightly
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
different operation and I'm unsure how
 
01:01:10.589 --> 01:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
the two committees will be able to
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
reconcile that um so that alone you guys
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
could report out and theoretically
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
report out on what you know two bills
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
that are doing very similar things um
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
additionally um this bill would require
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
additional reporting requirements for
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
the property owners and assessors um the
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
assessors currently they can confirm if
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
a pastor is residing in the residence
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
because they'll go by to these churches
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
or Charities um religious organizations
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
and they will confirm meeting with
 
01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
someone from the board of directors hey
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
are you using this building for
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
religious purpose are you having at
 
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
least two religious events religious
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
ceremonies a year and um is there
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
someone who is your pastor living in
 
01:01:56.910 --> 01:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
that parsonage so the s do that they
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
have to fulfill that to make sure that
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
it's all reported correctly to the
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
they require that
 
01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
um my third point is um the term funding
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
for and then specifically the term quote
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
standard religious programs is not used
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere at least in RSA um 72 colon 23
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
and it's not defined which is kind of
 
01:02:22.269 --> 01:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
where this issue is coming from why the
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
btla has had to make additional rulings
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
on this is because of the know
 
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
additional language the legislature
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
keeps adding that's vague and tough for
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
them to interpret um what is a standard
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
religious program to one assessor it
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
might mean one thing to another it might
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
mean another thing and to the btla who
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
will ultimately have to make some kind
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
of Quasi judicial decision they would
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
end up determining that rather than the
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislature so it's usually best when
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
laws are written well defined so then we
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to go through a a patchwork
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
process the assessors themselves they
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't like that um I'll also mention
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
that um to the point of renting out
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
these properties um charitable
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
organizations and nonprofits they don't
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
use they start turning a property for
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
like a commercial use or renting it out
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
um you know that's outside of their
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
religious Doctrine or their charitable
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
purpose um they you know that that will
 
01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
make it so they're no longer tax exempt
 
01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
what a lot of organizations do is they
 
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
have a suggested donation but they can't
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
provide services or fees um you know as
 
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
part of their duties unless it's
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know some kind of specific
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
charitable purpose that they have um
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's tied to why they were established
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
and with a religious organization their
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
tact exemption is usually tied to a
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
specific religious Doctrine or an
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
organization that has a religious
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
Doctrine so if you're a Baptist Church
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
you might be part of the league of
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
southern baptist churches or um so you
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
can point to that religious Doctrine
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
that's what you're operating under um
 
01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:53.240 align:start position:0%
I'll also mention um the term on Section
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
line um more than one worship building
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
so one worship building um that could
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
mean an organization could rent their
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
building six days a week for
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
non-religious uses which is outside of
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
their religious Doctrine or their
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
charitable purpose that's established
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
under 72 colon 23 so um I mean for some
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of those operational issues and
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are 10 bills trying
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
to change you know whether or not
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
charitable or um religious organizations
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
how their tax I mean the current
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
standard is if the land and the building
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
qualifies as the charitable purpose of
 
01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:29.799 align:start position:0%
the organization or the religious
 
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
purpose for the religious organization
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's claim claiming the tax exemption
 
01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
then they get it all other property that
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
they own that isn't being utilized
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
actively um by the organization that's
 
01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
subject to tax because it's not falling
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
under the qualifications for 72 col 23
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
so sorry to throw out a lot of technical
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
things to you I know that's a lot but um
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
I think it's important you have that
 
01:04:55.950 --> 01:04:55.960 align:start position:0%
context because we've shared it with
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government um
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
bills thank you very much um are there
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
any questions to start representive ol
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question I
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
was just reviewing the IRS regulations
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
on uh churches which they consider a
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
church automatically if they declare to
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
be a part of yeah blah blah
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
501c3 their l
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
for extraneous
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
property is that it's got to be a
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
business or a trade it's got to be
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
continually used for that
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
purpose and that the uh income derived
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
from that purpose does not substantially
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
support the church are you saying that
 
01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's taxation laws differ so
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
radically that the a a property can be
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
ex exempt from Federal Regulation paying
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
taxes as a
 
01:06:04.510 --> 01:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
501c3 but then have to pay a local
 
01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.309 align:start position:0%
501c3 but then have to pay a local
property

01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
tax I am not aware of the IRS code and I
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
haven't reviewed it um I following the
 
01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
state statute and how the state statute
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
how the btla has told assessors to
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
assess charitable or religious property
 
01:06:21.109 --> 01:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
is and what the court standards have
 
01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:23.799 align:start position:0%
been M numerous cases probably at least
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
10 over the last 30 years is property
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's exempt is only that that's being
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
used for the charitable or the religious
 
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
purpose so the building and any other
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
kind of property that might be
 
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
contiguous to that building that's
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
utilized so like a parking lot all other
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
property that's outside of that does
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
fall under the assessment and what's
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
happened is some assessors have decided
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
to say the entire lot the entire
 
01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
property is um not subject to assessment
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
and the btla has said that that is an
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
incorrect interpretation of 72 colon 23
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
that it's only at least a according to
 
01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
the statute it's only that property
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
actively being used for the charitable
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
purpose or the religious
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
purpose thank youing my question thank
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you is there um oh yes
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
represent SP thank you madam chair is
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
there an ex so if you as a church you're
 
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
investing in uh any sort of investment
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
stocks bonds mutual funds uh that is
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
exempt from federal tax taxable income
 
01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:27.799 align:start position:0%
Cor correct I I can't speak to the
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
federal statutes of how their investable
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
income would be taxed I think it is um
 
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
and I guess that was my questions I
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
guess the property tax is is localized
 
01:07:37.829 --> 01:07:37.839 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that is something that
 
01:07:40.269 --> 01:07:40.279 align:start position:0%
the local jurisdiction can choose to tax
 
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
or not that
 
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:43.720 align:start position:0%
entity the local jurisdiction doesn't
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
get a choice the legislature has in this
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
bill would not have a choice right no no
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
no in in current statute the legislature
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
determines how property is assessed and
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature says only
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
the reading of the statute as
 
01:08:00.269 --> 01:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
interpreted by the btla what they've
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
told the assessors is that it's only
 
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
property so on the lot it's only that
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
real property that's actively being used
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
for a charitable or religious purpose
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
any other property that is even on the
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
same lot or contiguous Lots that's
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
subject to property taxation it's part
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
of the assessment for the town okay
 
01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.390 align:start position:0%
of the assessment for the town okay
thank

01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:23.799 align:start position:0%
you on represent I didn't realize your
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
light was on representative BS
 
01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:26.910 align:start position:0%
light was on representative BS
and

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
then thank you madam chair thanks for
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
so it sounds to me like the btla needs
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
to get get out of this Arena unless
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to go do their homework it
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like this is a Witch Hunt
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
against the the churches M synagogues do
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
you agree I um I wouldn't agree with
 
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
that characterization they're trying to
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
interpret what is a complicated statute
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
that even assessors have had varying
 
01:08:54.799 --> 01:08:56.550 align:start position:0%
that even assessors have had varying
interpretations

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
interpretations
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
follow representative ORS I think that
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
question is out of
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
order don't you think that the btla
 
01:09:06.669 --> 01:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
needs to learn what the federal laws
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
before they enact laws that are outside
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
Federal representative ORS yes ma'am uh
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
he has said and it is true that our law
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
in local issues on
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
supersedes the the fed well is different
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
from the federal law and has
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree but that's okay
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay I I would like
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
to clarify Madam chairwoman that um I'm
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
not disagreeing with whether or not the
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
federal how the federal statutes
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
interplay here I'm saying this is a lot
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
more complicated in the board of tax and
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
land appeals their job is to when when
 
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
appeals come before them from Property
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
Owners about whether or not they should
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
be assessed or not um because sometimes
 
01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:52.279 align:start position:0%
there are disputes between the governing
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
bodies that oversee the assessment which
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
would be a board of Select of a order of
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
assessors it goes to the btla and it's
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
up to them they take on a quasi judicial
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
role similar to a superior court where
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
they basically make a ruling over how
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
the statutes to be interpreted and it's
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
a legislature who determines what
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
statutes exist for them to interpret and
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
if there's vagueness in the statute to
 
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
make sure there's uniformity they make
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
an interpretation a ruling and inform
 
01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
the assessors and the
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities thank you that's a very
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
good explanation of what has been
 
01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
occurring for a very long long time in
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
this state on representative Bolton
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mad chair um regarding um
 
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
other nonprofits like Hospital grounds
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
or the university um they have uh
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
basically acres and Acres of U like
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
Woods might that fall in or they have
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're under a separate statute I won't
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
speak to the State University system
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
because they might fall under a separate
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
statute um just because of the
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
uniqueness of how the legislator
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
established the system and sometimes the
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
legislature you know there are some
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
sections of um chapter 72 where they're
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
like for example there's a specific
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
section that I haven't reviewed recently
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
about granges so sometimes there are
 
01:11:08.110 --> 01:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
some unique classifications but when it
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
comes to like a hospital that was
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
established for a charitable purpose
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
which there are many hospitals that are
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofits that are established for
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
charitable purpose um the land that
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
they're utilizing in the building that
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
they have for that charitable purpose
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
that is tax exempt but the other land so
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
if you have a hospital and they use two
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
acres of their land for their physical
 
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
plant their Hospital their parking Etc
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
that is tax sorry that is not taxed
 
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
because it's charitable purpose but if
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
they had 98 other Acres of 100 acre lot
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
that would be taxed they could put it in
 
01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
current use if they wanted to Etc but
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
that does have to be it comes under the
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
assessment very good thank
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much thank you uh
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
could you is there any way you could put
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
this in writing since this is the first
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
time our committee has had to deal with
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
this I I do have some written testimony
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
on a separate bill that'll be coming to
 
01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
you guys I would really prefer that the
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
provide this committee with its legal
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
expertise and guidance I mean the
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we're here to
 
01:12:22.629 --> 01:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
represent the municipality's interest um
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue administration
 
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
at least you know my my opinion is they
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
they should be providing you with the
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
legal guidance of the interplay with the
 
01:12:33.669 --> 01:12:33.679 align:start position:0%
btla the federal statutes that the uh
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman mentioned I mean this is
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of moving parts
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
and they have experts who should
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
understand the interplay between these
 
01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:42.679 align:start position:0%
moving parts and provide written
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
guidance so I can if there is no
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
additional and the committee feels as if
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
it needs it to move forward so but I
 
01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
would really prefer to defer to them
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
testify for or
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
against this
 
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
bill then I'm going to close the
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
10 I'd like to talk about the situation
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
we have in ASA relative to the uh new
 
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
property that's coming in for expanded
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
gambling namely at the Sears
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
casino and the situation we currently
 
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
have is that our former Sears store
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
which is a fairly large uh Box Store 18
 
01:16:48.510 --> 01:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
180,000 square fet is now be being built
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
out into a
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
casino if you pull out the accessor
 
01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
cards you find that the current of the
 
01:16:58.669 --> 01:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
property is $116 million and that's
 
01:17:00.629 --> 01:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
varied between about 10 million and 16
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
million over the past 10
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
years vacant use for retail but
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
currently about 16
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
million the new tax rate in NASA is
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
$15.90 per thousand so the property tax
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
that would be realized to the city of
 
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
NASA for the property at the current
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
assessment is about $300,000
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
now would there be any reason to have
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
that assessment Changed by the tax
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
assessor I think the owner can argue
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
that well I've got the same square
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
footage 180,000 Square fet I have the
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
same up space it's the same business
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
district it's the same building it's not
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
new construction I've blown out a new
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
entrance in the back to the uh side that
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
faces tank Massachusetts where there
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
used to be a fire door now it's going to
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
be a main entrance but I think you can
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
argue that the assessor from the city of
 
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
Nash will um be tough to assess it at a
 
01:18:04.030 --> 01:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
higher rate given the parameters of the
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
current situation same building same
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
size same square
 
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
footage so what's the
 
01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
problem well it teres the use of that
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
building in my opinion and I back that
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
up by by handing out a 20-year study
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
called casinos crime at community cost
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
which is all in your
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
handout and this tries to look at what's
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
happened to counties in the United
 
01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
States when a casino's been introduced
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
compared to other counties where they've
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
not had
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
casinos so they took a look at these
 
01:18:51.149 --> 01:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
3165 counties all over the
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
US and looked at the 178 of those
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
counties that have class three gaming
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
devices slot
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
machines and what do we
 
01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
find well if you go through the summary
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
of this report which looks at all the
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
studies that have been uh collecting
 
01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
data on crime and Community
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
costs they conclude that the crime in
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
Casino counties is very low after the
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
opening there's people who've got new
 
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.310 align:start position:0%
opening there's people who've got new
jobs

01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
there's some uh additional commercial
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
activity that goes into these casinos
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
these counties that have casinos and
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's a u sometimes a net benefit for
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
the first year or
 
01:19:38.639 --> 01:19:40.229 align:start position:0%
the first year or
so

01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
however after years um three and four
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
there appears to be
 
01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
a a defined interest of crime going up
 
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:55.239 align:start position:0%
attributed to the casinos
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
and that particularly starts with
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
increased robbery after the first year
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
increase aggravated salt after years
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
three and burglary and larly increases
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
after years
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
four so what's the cost to the city that
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
hosts these
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
properties the study I have before you
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
analyzes that
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
cost and determined that the cost per
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
adult in these communities is $75 per
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
adult for the impacts of crime in the
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
city and that fee that cost of
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
$75 was in 1996 if you adjust it for
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.709 --> 01:20:46.719 align:start position:0%
2025 so i' estimate that the cost to n
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
for a casino of the size is about $150
 
01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
per adult in
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
2025 Nashville currently has 1,000
 
01:20:59.229 --> 01:20:59.239 align:start position:0%
residents roughly 71% are
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
adults I'm saying 2/3 for simple
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
calculation so if we have 2third of the
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
adults um facing an average cost of $150
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's about a $9 million
 
01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
expense to the city of
 
01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
Nashua for hosting a
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
casino and I suggest that if we're going
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
to have this kind of expense to host
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
this kind of property that the city
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
that's hosting it should have some sort
 
01:21:28.719 --> 01:21:29.669 align:start position:0%
that's hosting it should have some sort
of

01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
mitigation now prior bills that have
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
come before Ways and Means which had uh
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
a very comprehensive Casino analysis and
 
01:21:45.629 --> 01:21:45.639 align:start position:0%
mitigation typically have mitigation to
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
the host cities of the uh cost of
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
posting this particular Enterprise and
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
that typically is about 3% of the gross
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
slot machine Revenue to the host
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
communities with another 1% going to the
 
01:22:03.790 --> 01:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
abdy communities and a final 1% going to
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
the host County now at the present time
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
we have no such mitigation to the host
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
casinos we don't have a casino Bill we
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
have historic horse racing bill that
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
evolved out of chable gaming which has
 
01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
done quite well but now it's been
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
morphed into a full-blown casino and we
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
don't have a casino build so my proposal
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
here is one
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid until we can get a full Casino
 
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
Bill to get some mitigation to the city
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
and towns that are hosting these
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
properties and if you add my proposal
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
up and say that well we have a a new tax
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
which is a Enterprise tax for the use of
 
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
the property as a casino we have the
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
standard real estate
 
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
tax uh which is perhaps
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
$300,000 maybe more on the
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
buildout but the local community will be
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
to add a Enterprise tax which I've
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
defined as up to twice the assessed
 
01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.510 align:start position:0%
defined as up to twice the assessed
property

01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
value and if we have a Enterprise tax of
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
twice the assess value that may be
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
another 60 thou $600,000 for a total tax
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
to the city of NASA of $1
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
million and that's really a small
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
portion of the uh tax that would
 
01:23:32.189 --> 01:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
be anticipated had we had a casino bill
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
that would give 3% of the gross revenue
 
01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
to the host cities and
 
01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
towns and with that I'll take
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
elmy uh Susan El me city of
 
01:24:06.719 --> 01:24:08.270 align:start position:0%
elmy uh Susan El me city of
Lebanon

01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh and I just wanted to provide some
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
information which is irrelevant to the
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
actual subject of this bill but which is
 
01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.750 align:start position:0%
actual subject of this bill but which is
um

01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
due to where
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
um it was placed in um our
 
01:24:38.950 --> 01:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
rs72 uh
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
one is actually the resident tax for
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
those of you who are not in New
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh by I think it was on
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere around
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
1980s no yeah on every single adult in
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had to pay
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
$10 to their local government in order
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
vote whatever year that was uh the sup
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court or or the the state
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
government itself figured out okay this
 
01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.070 align:start position:0%
government itself figured out okay this
is

01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional but I think it was
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
probably the US Supreme Court because we
 
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
were uh
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
um it they left the statute on the
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
books and they took out some pieces of
 
01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:47.639 align:start position:0%
it it is still there uh I would
 
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
suggest that if we are going to pass
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
anything like this um which I also
 
01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.550 align:start position:0%
anything like this um which I also
um

01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.870 align:start position:0%
um
on

01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
on
co-sponsored

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored
 
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
on because I've been through how much it
 
01:26:09.310 --> 01:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
cost to do to allow a major Casino in
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
your state which we now have too many of
 
01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:15.510 align:start position:0%
your state which we now have too many of
um

01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
the um this section uh 71a be totally
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
wiped out and replaced with this instead
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
of adding it on and if not that we put a
 
01:26:33.109 --> 01:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
bill in next
 
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
year to get rid of the resident
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
tax which has not been collected since
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and that's all I wanted
 
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
to say about it except that I
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
agree that all of the bills that we
 
01:26:59.229 --> 01:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
dealt with before for major casinos and
 
01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
we dealt with a lot of them on required
 
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more payment to this to the city
 
01:27:12.910 --> 01:27:12.920 align:start position:0%
or town that was hosting it uh and to um
 
01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
to the county
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
usually so thank you thank you do we
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
have any questions for represent
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.709 --> 01:27:29.719 align:start position:0%

and
Means

01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
again thank you Mr chair and
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
members I wasn't planning on coming
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
today but then I read this
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill and I went wow that's all I can say
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
Wow first off uh I did look up the uh
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
this the statute that it's under is I'll
 
01:27:56.109 --> 01:27:56.119 align:start position:0%
just follow on to what representative
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
Aly is saying it's it's uh 72 colon
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
1 which uh way back when charged $10 a
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
resident uh anybody from 18 to
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
65 uh this tax and and I don't think
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
anybody ever adopted it but it's on the
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
books correctly it's on the books so
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
this new tax I will call it the uh
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
so first I thought maybe there's other
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
Enterprise maybe there are other
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
businesses being charged as Enterprise
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
tax there's no such thing as Enterprise
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
tax this is being created by this bill
 
01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:36.430 align:start position:0%
tax this is being created by this bill
okay

01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
so and the wow is when you read the text
 
01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
bill first off I use the example I guess
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative om used the example of U
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
what's got to Nash at $15 million I use
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
I use an example of 20
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
million let's say the assess value is 20
 
01:28:58.590 --> 01:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
million and it let's say it's $20 per
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
thousand so that facility would be
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
paying 4,000 in property
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
taxes by the way more than enough to
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
cover any extra police coverage or
 
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
that um but this bill says that we we
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
will tax two times the assess value not
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
at the not at the rate the actual assess
 
01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
value now please correct me if I have a
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
wrong but that would mean that that that
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
facility worth assess that 20 million
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
would have to pay 40 million a year in
 
01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.270 align:start position:0%
would have to pay 40 million a year in
this

01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
tax um please correct me if I'm wrong if
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
you've read the bill do I have that
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
wrong I I don't think I do so which is
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
totally out of re totally
 
01:29:53.229 --> 01:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
unrealistic so and unfair because here's
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
the unfair part
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
is why are we just picking on
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
casinos uh charal Gaming facilities I
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
mean here we go we're going to create a
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
tax just for charal Gaming
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
facilities that that that doesn't make
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
sense at all let's say it passed then
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
you can have people in these towns going
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a municipal tax they're
 
01:30:15.629 --> 01:30:15.639 align:start position:0%
going to say well let's let's tax the
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
movie theaters or let's tax something
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
else you know just
 
01:30:21.990 --> 01:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
because um and I don't I don't think
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
this would pass the muster of of the
 
01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court anyway uh because it's
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
really picking and choosing winners and
 
01:30:28.679 --> 01:30:29.750 align:start position:0%
really picking and choosing winners and
losers

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
losers
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
here um we have similar bills that are
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
not uh that come before Ways and Means
 
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
over the years the big one has always
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
been U Portsmith and Hampton folling a
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
bill to add like a $2 room tax on top of
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
the uh on top of the U um uh room meals
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
tax and we've always killed those bills
 
01:30:53.679 --> 01:30:54.430 align:start position:0%
tax and we've always killed those bills
here

01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:30:57.149 --> 01:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
always killed them uh I think in many
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
respects on a bipartisan basis because
 
01:31:01.229 --> 01:31:01.239 align:start position:0%
again it's a slopy slope if we start
 
01:31:02.669 --> 01:31:02.679 align:start position:0%
taxing that we're going to attx
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
something else and we don't in New
 
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we don't we don't do these
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
things as far as I just want to read we
 
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
we addressed the issue
 
01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
of um I'm going to go to my report the
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
the the Char gaming report from the
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
because I actually brought
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
up that you know right now the these
 
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
facilities are only charged a fee of
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
$750 a year to renew their their license
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay even for me it seemed a little low
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
but here's what the I'm going to read
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
the text of what the discussion was in
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
the committee the the question was
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
should we recommend increasing the
 
01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
current 750 annual license for Fe
 
01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
assessed to East facility that is
 
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
licensed the discussion was the annual
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
license fee of 750 has not changed since
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
2015 there was a recognition through
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
discussion that this fee was never
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
designed to cover full cost of
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
Regulation since most of the cost is
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
covered by the 10% gross Gaming revenue
 
01:32:17.709 --> 01:32:17.719 align:start position:0%
received by the state for table games
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
and the 16.77% received from
 
01:32:24.669 --> 01:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
HHR there was some discussion about a
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
tiered fee structure based on size of
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
facility and I brought that up uh again
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
there was recognition that the larger
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
the facility that the more revenues that
 
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
there will be more revenues generated
 
01:32:40.590 --> 01:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
for the state a portion of which is
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
utilized for
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
regulation with this discussion here's
 
01:32:46.030 --> 01:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
the recommendation it was decided not to
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
recommend increasing annual uh facility
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
fee at this time then there was another
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
um and here's the question shall the com
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
the commission shall examine whether
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
host communities should share in the
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
proceeds of any charal gaming
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
establishment so this goes more to what
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
this is being proposed so that and
 
01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
here's the discussion the legisl
 
01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
legislature this past session voted to
 
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
allow hosting municipalities to receive
 
01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
up to 10 dates of sponsorship if no
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
charities could be found to utilize
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
these dates at this juncture it appeared
 
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
and this was when I say this year it was
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
year or two ago okay now at this
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
juncture it appears that no
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities have received dates
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
because those dates are precious and the
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
Charities are are taking up the dates
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
the discussion then con uh then U
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
concerned whether these facilities
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
should be paying municipalities for
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
police coverage more than a restaurant
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
or a bar
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
these facilities already pay property
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
taxes like every other business it was
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
also pointed out that all these
 
01:34:05.669 --> 01:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
facilities already have paid security to
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
protect the public and what they do and
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
not to mention cameras everywhere
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's cameras everywhere in these
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
facilities so here's the recommendation
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
of the commission the consensus of the
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
commission is that other than the
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
current statute that would allow
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to utilize uh the use
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
charity days no action on this issue
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken at this time
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
so the the commission we've looked at
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
this we've addressed this uh
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
and again my conclusion is that this res
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
resident uh this uh Enterprise tax is
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
new it's it's it's picking on one
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
industry which doesn't is not not really
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
fair and uh and not only that it's
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
exorbitant in terms of the way the bill
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
is written in terms of what that tax
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be and that's the end of my
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
conclusion thank you do I have questions
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
you representative honorable
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative going to lines 2 three
 
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
four of this bill uh maybe I'm missing
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
something here when you mentioned if if
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
the property was assessed at 20 million
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
it would be a $40 million tax are you
 
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
saying are you talking the entire
 
01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
property because I as I keep reading I
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
have a comma to be known as Enterprise
 
01:35:41.070 --> 01:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
ta shall be assessed on every historic
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
racing and charitable gaming facility so
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking the entire
 
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
facility yes and not my bill I
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
understand I'm just trying to make sure
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
I understand that it's
 
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
including the the machines on the inside
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
right yes that's the way I interpret it
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
the physical facility itself that's the
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
way I interpret it
 
01:36:05.910 --> 01:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
and a tax amounting to two times all
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
right I just wanted to make sure I was
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
reading this yeah I'll read it out
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
loud the tax amounting to two times the
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
assessed property value of the of an
 
01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
Enterprise to be known as the Enterprise
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
tax shall be assessed on every historic
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
racing and Charo gaming facility as
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
governed by RSA
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
284 with 100 or more machines okay
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
there's a little subtlety here and 100
 
01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
or more so we're saying that you have to
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
have at least first off it says machines
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
I went to
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
284 there's no there's no definition of
 
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
machine that says it's a historic racing
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
machine so if this B bill would to be
 
01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:50.360 align:start position:0%
brought forward you should adjust that
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
to say ter gaming machines because
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
that's what they mean
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh but it's saying it so this is really
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
targeting the larger facilities the way
 
01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
I read it it's it's the the ones that
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
have well I mean I think the the new
 
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
nashaa U the Nash is going to have like
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
12,00 uh historic racing machine
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
something like that so 100 is modest
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
number but but again some of the
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
facilities like I said yesterday do not
 
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:23.080 align:start position:0%
have historic racing so this wouldn't
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
apply to them
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
either so anyway do I answer this
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
question Tom okay thank you
 
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.510 align:start position:0%
question Tom okay thank you
representative

01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
duet thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
I some of the testimony we heard was uh
 
01:37:44.669 --> 01:37:44.679 align:start position:0%
relative to past legislative efforts to
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
have full-blown
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
charity uh sorry full-blown Casino
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
gaming in New Hampshire do you happen to
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
remember how many pieces of legislation
 
01:37:57.390 --> 01:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
and coupled with that was a component
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
localities um yeah I believe it was
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
three% um how many times that came in
 
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
front of the legislature so I was legisl
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
for 12 years and um in the early years
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
we we have a bill every other year um
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
probably and my friend and I say my
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
friend uh senator delandro who just
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
retired um he would bring those bills to
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
us every every year and the last time he
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
came uh this is a story I'll tell he
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
came he presented it he pounded the
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
table I'll come back every year unless
 
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
you guys passed my this is real casinos
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
not terrible gaming you st if those were
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
here remember this and I'm going to come
 
01:38:39.719 --> 01:38:40.669 align:start position:0%
here remember this and I'm going to come
back

01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:40.679 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
again and then he came he came and
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
um um the bill didn't pass out of
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
committee I ran into
 
01:38:55.709 --> 01:38:55.719 align:start position:0%
Lou in the hallway a day later he says
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
Pat how my bill do I said look you
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
testified and then 10 people testified
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
against and nobody testified four so you
 
01:39:05.350 --> 01:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
were you were the General charging the
 
01:39:08.109 --> 01:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
hill but you had no troops behind you so
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
and after that he he never filed the
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
bill again so I would say three or four
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
times that's a long way of saying that
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
there's been three or four bills over
 
01:39:18.109 --> 01:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
the years we in the house rejected them
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
over and over again follow up follow up
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
so it failed
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
a few times and now we have the model
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
that we have right now so let me just
 
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.550 align:start position:0%
that we have right now so let me just
ask

01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
you this this is by definition a new tax
 
01:39:36.589 --> 01:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
and it's basically opening the
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
floodgates for a locality to tax any and
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
all Enterprise yes it's setting a
 
01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
precedent it's setting a precedent thank
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Yul thank you Mr
 
01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
you representative Yul thank you Mr
chair

01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
good to see you again I didn't have a
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
sense to say hello to you yesterday
 
01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
Jordan I
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
know um as a former Vice chair you're
 
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
aware of the house role regarding
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
constitutionality and the vice chair's
 
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
role on that right therefore would you
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
please send me your comments since you
 
01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:11.719 align:start position:0%
raised the question uh regarding that so
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
that we can do what we got to do I get
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
to do what I got to do that's first
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
question for you if you could do that
 
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
if this tax were to be
 
01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
applied to to corporations as
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
written is it your opinion that most of
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
the charitable gaming large charitable
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
gaming organizations would just
 
01:40:41.709 --> 01:40:41.719 align:start position:0%
disappear from New
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know if they would
 
01:40:46.510 --> 01:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
disappear uh they they have some options
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
and especially with the
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
machines um they they can control
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
there's a range in which the payout are
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
allowed um and they can make them pay
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
out less so that they can retain more
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's one potential if they
 
01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to wanted to keep their their net
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
revenue level that's reasonable the
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
other thing that that bothers me a bit
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
is that we have all these yes there's a
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
lot of outside companies now coming in
 
01:41:19.790 --> 01:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
they're investing millions and millions
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
in renovating these facilities these
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
malls that are dying there's two the the
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
other one is
 
01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
Rockingham uh there's another group
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's coming and wants to put a casino
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
in the old Rockingham um that's one of
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
the other big uh
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
Stores um so in a way they're kind of
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
helping save these malls they're helping
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
by by putting these facilities in there
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
so um I'll just leave it at that I mean
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
I it follow up Sir follow up so your
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
comment your suggestion would be given
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
the testimony we just heard yesterday
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
regarding on how many charitable
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
organizations rely upon both charitable
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh gaming table gaming it itself as well
 
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
as historic horse racing this would have
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
a dilit terious effect on the services
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
that they needed services that they
 
01:42:17.109 --> 01:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
provide to Citizens is that correct uh
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes because what what I was trying to
 
01:42:21.589 --> 01:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
say is that there's some wiggle on in
 
01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
terms of the percentage payout out of of
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
the historic racing machines like any in
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
any jurisdiction the statute is very
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
clear on what what the range is and they
 
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
and and they they try to keep it that
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
the payouts are higher so that people
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to play you put them too low people
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to play because they're not
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
winning so it's a magic number somewhere
 
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh that that they shoot for I mean in
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
Vegas not that I'm an expert on Vegas
 
01:42:50.589 --> 01:42:50.599 align:start position:0%
but in Vegas there's a lot of
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
competition right and they're all
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
competing for and and people who play
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
these machines a lot look for the the
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
the facility that pays off the
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
best so I'm this this is a uh a
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
supposition on my part that this is one
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
thing that they could possibly do to
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
make up the loss Revenue if I had if we
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
had to pay if I had to pay $40 million a
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
year that's going to eat into my
 
01:43:18.589 --> 01:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
profits and your question is will that
 
01:43:21.070 --> 01:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
impact the Charities I think indirectly
 
01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
it could because they'll they'll change
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
the formula so that they get better
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
payouts uh that U as well
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent elberger thank
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
questions yeah thank you and again I'm
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
still trying to formulate because
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff going on here
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I asked at an another hearing uh I
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
believe I asked the the gaming commit
 
01:43:55.830 --> 01:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
about are there any casinos in the state
 
01:43:59.950 --> 01:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
that are hurting and the response was no
 
01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.950 align:start position:0%
that are hurting and the response was no
right

01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned your concern about this
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
potential Enterprise tax being uh role
 
01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:44:14.669 --> 01:44:14.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities being a potentially being
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
able to pick and
 
01:44:18.990 --> 01:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
choose what kind of businesses they
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
might want to do that and that
 
01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:24.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities could potentially get
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
dates only there aren't any because the
 
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
casino owners apparently there's there
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be any other
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
decision-making Authority the casino
 
01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
owners pick and choose whom they're
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
giving their dates to so municipalities
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
are effectively blocked out by the
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
decision of the
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
casinos they're blocked can I this s i
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
part yeah they're blocked out because
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
there are so many Charities on mine
 
01:44:54.510 --> 01:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to that bill was illc conceived
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
that created that I mean it was like I
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know I wasn't here on
 
01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639 align:start position:0%
that past but it it said well we'll give
 
01:45:04.109 --> 01:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
we'll give the uh municipalities 10
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
days they really weren 10 days available
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
I mean every single day is is absorbed
 
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
by a
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
charity so I just read that just so you
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
know that there was an attempt to be
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
made and and that one didn't work um
 
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:23.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm wondering though
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
if your
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
objection to this potential tax is that
 
01:45:31.149 --> 01:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:45:34.109 --> 01:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
municipality getting to pick and choose
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
how it is that it seems to be okay for
 
01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
the casinos to pick and choose to whom
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to give their
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
days so that the municipalities don't
 
01:45:45.030 --> 01:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
have a shot at it the picking and
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
choosing part is still up for grabs in
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
terms of this next commission if you
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
read the we were made a recommendation
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
we listed a whole bunch of issues that
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
need to further be addressed and one of
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
them was who gets to pick the Charities
 
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's always been in statute that the
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
that the facilities get to pick the CH
 
01:46:08.189 --> 01:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
they Charities they have to go first go
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
to the aot to be approved that they're a
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
real charity and all that um and they
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
have to be a charity for a year or two I
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
forget what it is maybe a year we just
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
want people saying I'm a charity now and
 
01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
and saying I want two years is two years
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
so um so I I think I answer your
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
question but it's it's more or
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
less thank you representative
 
01:46:37.870 --> 01:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
Yuri thank you representative Elbert
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
stimulated a question my I remember the
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
discussions that we had uh regarding the
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh operation of the various Charities
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
and one correct me if I'm wrong I'm a
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
little hazy on that because didn't
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
attend the commission meeting like uh
 
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
like you
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
did but
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
aren't the organizations that run these
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
casinos and these gaming rooms aren't
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
they required by law to be
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
profitable that I can't I can't remember
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
that in order to make I I think
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
they it's free
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
enterprise if they're not profitable
 
01:47:18.189 --> 01:47:18.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to go out of business so
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh we we certainly have a a free
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
enterprise model here
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's what's led to we having 14
 
01:47:31.149 --> 01:47:31.159 align:start position:0%
licenses um now that the legislature two
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
years ago or last year I guess put put a
 
01:47:37.189 --> 01:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
cap on we have 14 licenses and they they
 
01:47:38.830 --> 01:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
they've approved another five for
 
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
another so you can go up to 19
 
01:47:44.189 --> 01:47:44.199 align:start position:0%
facilities that's that's just for the
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
historic racing license part of it it's
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
not a license but approval for historic
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
racing so
 
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
um so right now we have a capit number
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
facilities at 19 uh for at least 5 years
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
um but but yes all of them seem to be
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
profitable we have somebody from Lottery
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
here could could address that if you
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
really want that question
 
01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
answered thank you more current with
 
01:48:16.109 --> 01:48:16.119 align:start position:0%

Preston thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
Alicia Preston I represent the New
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire charitable gaming operators
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
Association uh I'll be brief because
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative bramy really hit on a lot
 
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
of our points uh we are here to oppose
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
this bill we know of no other industry
 
01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire where
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
municipality is allowed to tax one
 
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
industry in particular we also think the
 
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
discussion of this increased cost of
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
shable gaming being housed in the
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
community is no different than any
 
01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
increased cost of a sporting event a
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
concert venue a bar a restaurant I live
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
at Hampton Beach we have two of these
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
charitable casinos and we have numerous
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
music venues and bars and I assure you
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
the Minal Municipal Services required
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
are far less at the two casinos and many
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the other businesses at Hampton Beach
 
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
just like all properties in New
 
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire terrible Gaming facilities pay
 
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes every one of the
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
operating facilities have spent a lot of
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
money improve improving them over the
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
last several years which has increased
 
01:49:27.310 --> 01:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
their value and then increased the money
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
obviously they're paying to the
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
municipality and let's not forget in
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
situations like this there are no
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
children in the school system from the
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes they're paying so for
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
those reasons we are opposing this
 
01:49:42.550 --> 01:49:42.560 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you representative
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
duet thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just making me
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
obvious obvious so I would assume that
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
they're paying business Enterprise tax
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
business profit tax they're paying that
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
and of course they're paying the tax
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
that comes out to the Charities and the
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
state revenue in the money they make and
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
the profit they
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
have representative opal thank you Mr
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
question um both you and representative
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
bramy had brought up a point I thought
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
was interesting and I just want to make
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
sure I
 
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
understand you're telling this committee
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
you believe it's wrong for a tax scheme
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
to tax one industry or one kind of
 
01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.229 align:start position:0%
to tax one industry or one kind of
company

01:50:23.229 --> 01:50:23.239 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
differently than others is that correct
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
I believe the state of New Hampshire
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
should not be allowing municipalities to
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
tackle one industry over another yes
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
what about the
 
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
state for well I mean the state does in
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
different Industries the charitable
 
01:50:38.669 --> 01:50:38.679 align:start position:0%
gaming is taxed differently than a
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant right there's rooms and meals
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
tax and but that's from a state
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
construct as opposed to municipality
 
01:50:46.750 --> 01:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
like I said I know of no other industry
 
01:50:48.669 --> 01:50:48.679 align:start position:0%
that allows munici the state allows a
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
municipality to tax on their own thank
 
01:50:51.239 --> 01:50:54.260 align:start position:0%
municipality to tax on their own thank

01:50:54.260 --> 01:50:54.270 align:start position:0%

01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the um Ways and
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
Means Committee my name is Lauren O
 
01:51:47.709 --> 01:51:47.719 align:start position:0%
Sullivan and I am the senior Financial
 
01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
Analyst at the Department of Revenue um
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
as with all bills we do not have a
 
01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but we are coming
 
01:51:58.350 --> 01:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
here today with um some of our
 
01:52:00.189 --> 01:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation and we want to make sure
 
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
we understand um what the bill is trying
 
01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:04.310 align:start position:0%
we understand um what the bill is trying
to

01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:52:06.910 --> 01:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
do and I I was listening to some of the
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard so far and I think it
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
answered some of our questions but one
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
thing that we were concerned with was
 
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
that the term assess property value was
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
not defined in this bill and our re we
 
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
weren't sure whether this refers to to
 
01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
the Enterprise property value as
 
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
reported by the city or town on the
 
01:52:30.750 --> 01:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
pa28 the inventory of taxable propert
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
property pursuant to RSA chapter 74 or
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
um tax liability for property that would
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise exist so we and it sounds like
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
what I heard that was based on what the
 
01:52:47.950 --> 01:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes um assessed for that for
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
that charitable gaming commission um
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
facility so we would just need
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe have that clarified because there
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
were three different interpretations on
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
what that would have
 
01:53:03.629 --> 01:53:03.639 align:start position:0%
meant also um within our reading we saw
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
um this was supposed to be an optional
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
text but it but to me at least it read
 
01:53:12.430 --> 01:53:12.440 align:start position:0%
that you have to um elect to opt out of
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
the Enterprise tax so if the intent was
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
to opt in or opt out um maybe uh amend
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
some of that language to make that
 
01:53:24.709 --> 01:53:24.719 align:start position:0%
clearer and also so
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
um also one thing that is missing from
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
the bill so in order for the Dr to
 
01:53:34.589 --> 01:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
assess the 100 machines at the casinos
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily have the the rulle
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
making authority to allow the
 
01:53:41.950 --> 01:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
that and open to any other questions
 
01:53:50.109 --> 01:53:50.119 align:start position:0%
okay any questions represent viy um
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are
 
01:53:52.599 --> 01:53:54.310 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question are
questions

01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:53:58.069 --> 01:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
um it was it was questioned earlier
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
whether or not bet BPT meals and rooms

Easton and Livermore and I'm pleased to
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
03:07:54.870 --> 03:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
737 creating local options for games of
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
chance I'm standing in for the Bill's
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor representative Boyd who's
 
03:08:02.429 --> 03:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
under the weather but on the men uh
 
03:08:06.070 --> 03:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
today um and uh happy to uh bring the
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill forward um House Bill 737 is not a
 
03:08:13.750 --> 03:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
gambling bill but a local option zoning
 
03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
Bill uh I'm not a a gambler myself but
 
03:08:21.309 --> 03:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
this matter requires local control uh
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
particularly now since these um uh uh uh
 
03:08:29.910 --> 03:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
games game centers uh have have historic
 
03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
horse racing machines in them
 
03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
potentially uh something much more
 
03:08:37.510 --> 03:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
analogous uh to slot machines uh this
 
03:08:39.870 --> 03:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
bill brings similar local rights
 
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
relating to casinos that are already in
 
03:08:46.030 --> 03:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
place for Kino uh the local option
 
03:08:49.070 --> 03:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
through the local warrant uh article
 
03:08:52.229 --> 03:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
process uh this bill was initiated uh
 
03:08:55.070 --> 03:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
last term when a casino wanted to come
 
03:08:55.080 --> 03:08:55.830 align:start position:0%
last term when a casino wanted to come
uh

03:08:55.830 --> 03:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
into uh the North country and a group of
 
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
constituents uh uh came to us uh to
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
bring forward local option when their
 
03:09:06.429 --> 03:09:06.439 align:start position:0%
attempt to deal with a casino through
 
03:09:08.750 --> 03:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
zoning was declared invalid due to the
 
03:09:12.150 --> 03:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
Dylan rule uh in C uh in committee the
 
03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
casino Lobby agreed to a local option
 
03:09:17.070 --> 03:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
concept and helped develop language that
 
03:09:20.070 --> 03:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
was acceptable to both the casinos and
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
the local option proponents uh the
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
casino interests have been very
 
03:09:26.750 --> 03:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable and helpful in developing of
 
03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill uh the constituents have been
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh diligent with this joint work uh it
 
03:09:34.950 --> 03:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
should be noted that um the bill that
 
03:09:36.950 --> 03:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about from last term
 
03:09:40.030 --> 03:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
passed the house with 85% support and a
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
very a similar bill pass the Senate uh
 
03:09:45.070 --> 03:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
but um was tripped up in the committee
 
03:09:49.030 --> 03:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
of conference process so we're back here
 
03:09:51.710 --> 03:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
um this term uh with virtually an
 
03:09:54.229 --> 03:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
identical Bill uh the local option
 
03:09:55.910 --> 03:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
design of this bill conserves the
 
03:09:58.229 --> 03:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
investment made by the casino operators
 
03:10:00.510 --> 03:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
already involved and bring only brings
 
03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
an exit vote if the casino has been uh
 
03:10:06.830 --> 03:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
abandoned your copy says two years uh
 
03:10:11.190 --> 03:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
there's uh um uh a longer period such of
 
03:10:14.309 --> 03:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
for 5 to 10 is also under
 
03:10:17.469 --> 03:10:17.479 align:start position:0%
consideration um the local option would
 
03:10:19.389 --> 03:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
give local municipalities a voice in
 
03:10:21.510 --> 03:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
their process of whether having a casino
 
03:10:25.150 --> 03:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
in their town or city uh uh it would be
 
03:10:27.510 --> 03:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh why should local option
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
be enacted for the casinos uh simply uh
 
03:10:34.190 --> 03:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
we already do it for for Kino something
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
um you know much much simpler less less
 
03:10:40.030 --> 03:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
potential harm less all-encompassing
 
03:10:42.910 --> 03:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
than something like a casino uh Casino
 
03:10:44.910 --> 03:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
can be a large presence in the community
 
03:10:47.309 --> 03:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
economically and has impact on the
 
03:10:49.630 --> 03:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
business sector uh and certainly
 
03:10:51.429 --> 03:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
something that the local people will
 
03:10:54.910 --> 03:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
want to have an option on uh the U you
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
know you know certainly the risks of
 
03:10:59.469 --> 03:10:59.479 align:start position:0%
addiction and other uh implications for
 
03:11:03.190 --> 03:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
the local town uh warrant their input uh
 
03:11:05.309 --> 03:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
these large influences and risks are the
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
reasons for local consent for permitting
 
03:11:09.670 --> 03:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
casinos into the
 
03:11:12.030 --> 03:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
municipality um there's other others
 
03:11:14.790 --> 03:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
here that are uh willing as you said as
 
03:11:16.229 --> 03:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
you said there's been a lot of work done
 
03:11:18.950 --> 03:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
done on the previous uh bi Anum on this
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
and uh that received overwhelming house
 
03:11:23.590 --> 03:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
support and I uh think you'll be
 
03:11:26.150 --> 03:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing the same uh with with
 
03:11:28.670 --> 03:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of minor tweaks uh that you may
 
03:11:31.309 --> 03:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
feel appropriate so I'll just leave it
 
03:11:34.429 --> 03:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
at that and uh let others here here who
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
who have done more work on this than I
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
have uh speak as well uh but if you have
 
03:11:40.950 --> 03:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
any questions I'm happy to answer them
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
now and thank you very much thank you do
 
03:11:48.110 --> 03:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:59.229 --> 03:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:03.110 --> 03:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
you next I'll invite uh former State Rep
 
03:12:09.269 --> 03:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:12.030 --> 03:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
bromy thank you Mr chair I know you're
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
probably tired of seeing me but this is
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
going to be a change I'm actually here
 
03:12:18.510 --> 03:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
to uh support this
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill um so and representative stringam
 
03:12:24.790 --> 03:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
is very modest he he was a member of way
 
03:12:28.349 --> 03:12:28.359 align:start position:0%
means years ago when I was here as well
 
03:12:28.359 --> 03:12:29.950 align:start position:0%
means years ago when I was here as well
so

03:12:29.950 --> 03:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
um the commission addressed this I'm
 
03:12:34.830 --> 03:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
going to start with this and I like I've
 
03:12:36.229 --> 03:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
been doing on all these I'm going to
 
03:12:40.389 --> 03:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:43.510 --> 03:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
24 the question was should we add the
 
03:12:46.229 --> 03:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
statute uh a local option given the
 
03:12:48.349 --> 03:12:48.359 align:start position:0%
citizens of the IP alties the ability to
 
03:12:51.150 --> 03:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
weigh in on whether charal gaming be
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
allowed in their communities with all
 
03:12:56.429 --> 03:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
existing facilities or those five
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
applications under consideration being
 
03:13:01.269 --> 03:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
grandfathered in an exempt from the
 
03:13:04.269 --> 03:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
statue and the discussion went like this
 
03:13:06.710 --> 03:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
all municipalities in which Lottery
 
03:13:09.070 --> 03:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
products are
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
sold Kino and brick and mortar uh sites
 
03:13:15.309 --> 03:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
for sports betting so all lottery sites
 
03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
Kino and brick and mortar sports betting
 
03:13:22.070 --> 03:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
facilities are all opt in opt in this is
 
03:13:24.349 --> 03:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
an opt out building bill so I'm going to
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
get back to this in a minute but they're
 
03:13:29.110 --> 03:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
opt in New Hampshire statutes are silent
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
on this for charal gaming locations the
 
03:13:34.910 --> 03:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
legislature tried and as representative
 
03:13:37.389 --> 03:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
stringam mentioned the legislature tried
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
at this session meeting last year to
 
03:13:42.150 --> 03:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
establish an opt out provision which
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
passed both the house and the Senate was
 
03:13:45.630 --> 03:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
said and failed in conference committee
 
03:13:47.950 --> 03:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
on a technicality
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and this is what the recommendation
 
03:13:50.790 --> 03:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
is the commission recommends that the
 
03:13:53.309 --> 03:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
legislature pass a local option bill
 
03:13:54.910 --> 03:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
that would impact any future proposed
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
charal gaming facility that will exempt
 
03:14:00.510 --> 03:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
all existing facilities that exist or
 
03:14:02.910 --> 03:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
that are planned and as I I've been
 
03:14:05.790 --> 03:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
mentioning there are technically 14
 
03:14:08.070 --> 03:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
licenses out there right now plus five
 
03:14:09.670 --> 03:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
that are in the pipeline so that's what
 
03:14:13.670 --> 03:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about those 19 that that um
 
03:14:16.030 --> 03:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
and one of them is is well I'll say it
 
03:14:18.870 --> 03:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
that way
 
03:14:24.750 --> 03:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
so I I I support this u i my only Twist
 
03:14:27.269 --> 03:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
on this is that I would prefer it to be
 
03:14:29.469 --> 03:14:29.479 align:start position:0%
an opt in because of what I just said
 
03:14:32.710 --> 03:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
all of all of Lottery is opt in and this
 
03:14:36.630 --> 03:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
is kind of a lottery thing so uh I would
 
03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
still I would still U support it if it
 
03:14:43.269 --> 03:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
was opt out but it's an op in you know I
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
think it would be the preferred way to
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
do it and um in terms of the bill the
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
only other concern I had was that we
 
03:14:52.950 --> 03:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
were protecting those existing
 
03:14:55.110 --> 03:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and on the first page of the
 
03:15:00.110 --> 03:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill on lines uh 27 to 30 it reads any
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
vote by municipality to prohibit games
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
of chance within its boundaries shall
 
03:15:07.389 --> 03:15:07.399 align:start position:0%
not apply not apply to the games of
 
03:15:09.870 --> 03:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
chance operator licensed by The Lottery
 
03:15:12.990 --> 03:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
Commission or by applicant who has
 
03:15:15.389 --> 03:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
applied for the games of chance operat
 
03:15:17.469 --> 03:15:17.479 align:start position:0%
operator license prior to the
 
03:15:21.070 --> 03:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
of of the of the petition so that would
 
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
be the 14 plus the five um I'm not quite
 
03:15:25.550 --> 03:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
sure what it is now but that's what it
 
03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
was last year so I support it I I prefer
 
03:15:31.389 --> 03:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
an op in but um it's up to you folks if
 
03:15:33.189 --> 03:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
you want to do an opt-in or an opt out
 
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
but again just remember the the rest of
 
03:15:38.469 --> 03:15:38.479 align:start position:0%
Lottery is opt in and I'll give you one
 
03:15:41.710 --> 03:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
example uh Kino and by the way in The
 
03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
Kino bill that I supported way back when
 
03:15:47.550 --> 03:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
I insisted that there be an OP in
 
03:15:49.950 --> 03:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
provision in the in the statute back
 
03:15:54.189 --> 03:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
then and uh and uh when you talk to
 
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
Charlie McIntyre executive director of
 
03:15:59.269 --> 03:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
Lottery he gets a call from Portsmouth
 
03:16:00.670 --> 03:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
every once in a while and say come on in
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
talk to this to the uh Town U it's a
 
03:16:09.269 --> 03:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
city city council members and he say I
 
03:16:10.750 --> 03:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
go I've gone there three or four times
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
they always vote it down so um so so I
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable I've never supported
 
03:16:20.110 --> 03:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
this before because there was never this
 
03:16:23.070 --> 03:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
option for a facility here in the state
 
03:16:25.469 --> 03:16:25.479 align:start position:0%
even even before we did historic
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
racing um and I I and and I used to say
 
03:16:30.189 --> 03:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
during historic racing we're adding a
 
03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
new game we're not adding a new facility
 
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
we're adding a new game uh and that so
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
if you want to have a a provision it
 
03:16:39.790 --> 03:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
should be on the facility not on the
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
game that's being played
 
03:16:44.590 --> 03:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
so so that's those are my comments thank
 
03:16:47.189 --> 03:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
you representative UL
 
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
question when such a restriction is put
 
03:16:55.229 --> 03:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
on on businesses I'm thinking New York
 
03:16:58.510 --> 03:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
and taxi cab medallions which is similar
 
03:17:01.150 --> 03:17:01.160 align:start position:0%
where they limit who can participate in
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
that the value becomes artificially High
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the point that you eliminate
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
competition to only those who are most
 
03:17:11.790 --> 03:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
wealthy in order to participate would
 
03:17:15.590 --> 03:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
not this type of legislation do exactly
 
03:17:18.269 --> 03:17:18.279 align:start position:0%
the same thing and I have a follow up I
 
03:17:20.950 --> 03:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
mean we we have plenty of examples of
 
03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
optin and opt out in our statutes right
 
03:17:25.469 --> 03:17:25.479 align:start position:0%
now tattoo
 
03:17:29.590 --> 03:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
parlers porn shops I mean to say uh
 
03:17:31.349 --> 03:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
other other things that they're opt in
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
or opt out communities have a say and
 
03:17:36.110 --> 03:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
what kind of establishments they want so
 
03:17:39.630 --> 03:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of precedent for that so I
 
03:17:40.910 --> 03:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think the president's already the
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
president's already said that U you can
 
03:17:46.830 --> 03:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
restrict if the town decides to restrict
 
03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
if you want to think in a Libertarian
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
way um yeah it it restricts certain
 
03:17:56.229 --> 03:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
businesses but again it's up to the town
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.910 --> 03:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
that and the the cor to that is when you
 
03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
restrict one of these charitable gaming
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
in as we learned yesterday you were
 
03:18:10.469 --> 03:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
present for most of well probably all
 
03:18:14.790 --> 03:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
the testimony almost all of it
 
03:18:17.910 --> 03:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
um it restricts the abil IL of those
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
Charities to provide needed services to
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
their client Els because they're limited
 
03:18:26.229 --> 03:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
as to where they can
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
operate uh perhaps not getting the same
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh return for their
 
03:18:35.870 --> 03:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
investment at the different facilities
 
03:18:38.110 --> 03:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
because of the location I mean it's
 
03:18:40.510 --> 03:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
easier to go to Sears and the peasant
 
03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:45.160 align:start position:0%
Lane Mall than it is to go to uh right a
 
03:18:48.309 --> 03:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
mall in Milford off of 101
 
03:18:50.510 --> 03:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
so we had a representative from the
 
03:18:52.469 --> 03:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office who sat at the
 
03:18:54.269 --> 03:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
commission with us when we were
 
03:18:57.630 --> 03:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
discussing this he said that there are
 
03:19:00.189 --> 03:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
certain certain kinds of things that are
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
a privileged to do versus not a
 
03:19:05.630 --> 03:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
privilege to do I don't know if I'm
 
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
using the right term but and he says
 
03:19:11.710 --> 03:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
casinos are one of those things is what
 
03:19:14.590 --> 03:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
that was his guidance to us okay his
 
03:19:17.309 --> 03:19:17.319 align:start position:0%
guidance was that this was
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
restrict understood and yes it is a
 
03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
privilege um as opposed to it right
 
03:19:33.550 --> 03:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
however the question was regarding the
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
generation of Revenue if for example uh
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
just the the Nash or whatever the house
 
03:19:43.389 --> 03:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
is going to be called
 
03:19:47.710 --> 03:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
um is blocked by zoning regulation
 
03:19:48.870 --> 03:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
I suppose they could do it in the
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
parking lot do it in Massachusetts but
 
03:19:56.710 --> 03:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh is blocked by zoning regulations
 
03:20:00.830 --> 03:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
whereas you know 10 miles away at a
 
03:20:00.840 --> 03:20:02.750 align:start position:0%
whereas you know 10 miles away at a
lesser

03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
lesser
 
03:20:06.189 --> 03:20:06.199 align:start position:0%
facility and with fewer uh days
 
03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
available for any particular charity
 
03:20:10.349 --> 03:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
would not the Charities that are
 
03:20:14.110 --> 03:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
involved in this lose Revenue because of
 
03:20:17.790 --> 03:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
this type of selective zoning
 
03:20:19.150 --> 03:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
again that's a whole enough issue which
 
03:20:25.309 --> 03:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you brought it up many towns do
 
03:20:26.590 --> 03:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
restrict through
 
03:20:30.590 --> 03:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
zoning Salem does that Salem says it's
 
03:20:33.389 --> 03:20:33.399 align:start position:0%
on Route 27 the chair can probably
 
03:20:34.990 --> 03:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
explain it better than I or
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative said long time ago they
 
03:20:41.950 --> 03:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
zoned without this legislation they Zone
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
certain po portions of the town that
 
03:20:47.229 --> 03:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
it's okay to have terrible gaming so
 
03:20:48.790 --> 03:20:48.800 align:start position:0%
that that that mechanism is already
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
available to to towns if they want to do
 
03:20:55.309 --> 03:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.469 --> 03:20:59.479 align:start position:0%
way yes Hudson has an area in the uh has
 
03:21:02.030 --> 03:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
is part of its zoning Court uh s so
 
03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
businesses can only uh sexually
 
03:21:08.910 --> 03:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
oriented businesses can only occur it's
 
03:21:12.429 --> 03:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
a good acronym SOB for that particular
 
03:21:17.269 --> 03:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
industry uh can only occur in industrial
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
area that is allowing the business to
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
operate but restricting as to where it
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
can operate this is restricting the
 
03:21:27.790 --> 03:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
ability of an industry to
 
03:21:29.750 --> 03:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
exist well I'm not going to disagree
 
03:21:31.950 --> 03:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
with you but again we have plenty person
 
03:21:34.189 --> 03:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
in for this
 
03:21:36.870 --> 03:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh we've heard plenty of
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
testimony uh from some folks I think are
 
03:21:43.630 --> 03:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
going to be testifying today about where
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
their Community was dead against having
 
03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
I think the representative Stringham
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
brought it up uh the North Country
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
example uh where where the town really
 
03:21:58.150 --> 03:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
didn't want this and it's it's going to
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
happen um and and it it's the character
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the town they felt that their town a
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
small pristine Town um didn't want to
 
03:22:10.950 --> 03:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
have this not like a city Salem's big
 
03:22:15.630 --> 03:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
other you know Hudson's pretty big uh so
 
03:22:18.070 --> 03:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
again we're splitting hears I think a
 
03:22:21.469 --> 03:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
little bit on this I I think you know
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's we we have
 
03:22:26.550 --> 03:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
restrictions for all other lottery
 
03:22:28.590 --> 03:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
including here here's a funny story if
 
03:22:31.870 --> 03:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
you want one I mean when the lottery
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
first all the all the lottery games
 
03:22:36.189 --> 03:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
first came came about and some of you
 
03:22:37.950 --> 03:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
know the
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
story it was it was an opt in so towns
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
opt in to topped in opted in and then
 
03:22:47.630 --> 03:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
years went by and a lot of didn't opt in
 
03:22:49.630 --> 03:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
because there was no convenience store
 
03:22:52.030 --> 03:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
in town there was no facility to sell
 
03:22:54.309 --> 03:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
those tickets the scratch tickets or
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
whatever then all of a sudden loty
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
discovers like 10 years later these
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
towns are are asking for licenses to
 
03:23:05.150 --> 03:23:05.160 align:start position:0%
open no no wa your town hasn't voted yet
 
03:23:07.349 --> 03:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know so even even with the lottery
 
03:23:09.950 --> 03:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
itself it's it's been restricted for
 
03:23:11.910 --> 03:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
years and we were the first Lottery
 
03:23:14.830 --> 03:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
States right so
 
03:23:19.950 --> 03:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
um again most most towns have adopted
 
03:23:23.030 --> 03:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
opt in now for for lottery
 
03:23:26.510 --> 03:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
games but I think I think the casinos
 
03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
are you know the charitable gaming
 
03:23:29.910 --> 03:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
locations are are different uh for a lot
 
03:23:32.229 --> 03:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
of towns and as long as to me as long as
 
03:23:33.630 --> 03:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
we're not interfering with the ones who
 
03:23:35.229 --> 03:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
are grandfathered
 
03:23:39.189 --> 03:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
in I'm okay with I'm okay with this
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
bill I mean you and I can argue back and
 
03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:49.469 --> 03:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
know represent Al me thank you I'm not
 
03:23:53.630 --> 03:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
going to go into past history here uh
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
but on there is in here and I don't know
 
03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:00.150 align:start position:0%
but on there is in here and I don't know
if

03:24:00.150 --> 03:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:24:03.550 --> 03:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
um a future person testifying is going
 
03:24:07.830 --> 03:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
to uh talk to it both the games of
 
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
chance that are much less
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
damaging and um provide less money uh
 
03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and the historic horse racing machines
 
03:24:25.950 --> 03:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
that provide most of the money uh are in
 
03:24:29.309 --> 03:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
there together it looks like you have to
 
03:24:32.510 --> 03:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay both of them at the same time in my
 
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
community anti-gambling
 
03:24:37.030 --> 03:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
community on
 
03:24:42.269 --> 03:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
we we had uh a lot of people saying
 
03:24:45.150 --> 03:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
saying well the poker parlor is fine
 
03:24:47.389 --> 03:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's not going to cause any problems and
 
03:24:49.309 --> 03:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
it didn't cause any problems until the
 
03:24:54.790 --> 03:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
machines came in uh but uh putting it
 
03:24:59.189 --> 03:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
together so that you have to ban both of
 
03:25:04.830 --> 03:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
them rather than choose seems to me uh
 
03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary okay my understanding is
 
03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
that it's it's the uh the uh employee
 
03:25:13.710 --> 03:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
what was the license called the employee
 
03:25:18.189 --> 03:25:18.199 align:start position:0%
Alicia what is that called employee
 
03:25:20.110 --> 03:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
operator employer
 
03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
license that's what's being restricted
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
the operator employer license now if the
 
03:25:27.670 --> 03:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
language doesn't say that that that's
 
03:25:29.070 --> 03:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
really what it
 
03:25:33.389 --> 03:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
is and and that that creates the
 
03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
facility in the in the in the in the in
 
03:25:38.349 --> 03:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
03:25:41.229 --> 03:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
location so
 
03:25:44.389 --> 03:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
um that's my understanding of
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
it and I'm trying to find on the statute
 
03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
you you were referring to can you give
 
03:26:08.750 --> 03:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:12.389 --> 03:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
number could you put your microphone
 
03:26:16.349 --> 03:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
on they're there're on
 
03:26:18.910 --> 03:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
section c and section D in the bill on
 
03:26:22.590 --> 03:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
page one lines 17 to
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
22 on requires two questions it looks
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
like one of them is prohibiting games of
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
chance the second one is
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
um shall we provide oh no wait a minute
 
03:26:39.429 --> 03:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
this is this
 
03:26:43.030 --> 03:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:45.870 --> 03:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
different but it does seem I mean we I
 
03:26:47.790 --> 03:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
didn't see language that's why I was
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
asking where it is with a casino rather
 
03:26:53.830 --> 03:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
than a poker parlor because the poker
 
03:26:56.110 --> 03:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
parlor was there and people thought it
 
03:26:59.309 --> 03:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem I think the Poca I
 
03:27:00.990 --> 03:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
think the Poca is the same license
 
03:27:03.189 --> 03:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
though yeah so these facilities can open
 
03:27:05.229 --> 03:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
and just play have poker um and a good
 
03:27:08.189 --> 03:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
example of that is uh is Chasers and and
 
03:27:10.510 --> 03:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
Salem which has mostly poker they have
 
03:27:13.950 --> 03:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
other table games but they mostly poker
 
03:27:16.030 --> 03:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
and they've been there a long long time
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
um um matter of fact they they took when
 
03:27:21.389 --> 03:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Park Rockingham Park was a
 
03:27:24.150 --> 03:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
charal gaming after it it closed as a
 
03:27:26.710 --> 03:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
horse racing facility became terrible
 
03:27:30.389 --> 03:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
gaming and um and they they all the and
 
03:27:32.830 --> 03:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
they I I remember visiting there once
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I seen all the poker players there
 
03:27:38.510 --> 03:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
mostly from Massachusetts by the way um
 
03:27:39.910 --> 03:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
but when that closed they all went over
 
03:27:45.269 --> 03:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
to Chasers in Salem um but so and
 
03:27:46.269 --> 03:27:46.279 align:start position:0%
actually they're one of the more
 
03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
profitable believe it or not and they
 
03:27:50.269 --> 03:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
don't have historic racing machines and
 
03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
that's one of the more profitable uh
 
03:27:55.389 --> 03:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
operations but again I didn't see what
 
03:27:57.070 --> 03:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
you were orally saying I don't think
 
03:27:59.229 --> 03:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
there's two licens I think I was
 
03:28:02.349 --> 03:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding it but there is all
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
games of chance have to be
 
03:28:08.429 --> 03:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
banned uh though we did we
 
03:28:12.469 --> 03:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
legalized poker about 10 years ago
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
before that it was illegal but people
 
03:28:18.030 --> 03:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
were all meeting in poker games anyway
 
03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:20.830 align:start position:0%
were all meeting in poker games anyway
uh

03:28:20.830 --> 03:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:28:24.070 --> 03:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
and and craps is hardly ever done
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
because it costs too much money to run
 
03:28:30.429 --> 03:28:30.439 align:start position:0%
it um and um
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
roulette um was legal back in the day
 
03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
when um the traveling circus was taking
 
03:28:41.469 --> 03:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
the machines around right
 
03:28:44.790 --> 03:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
um the equivalent of of um slot machines
 
03:28:52.870 --> 03:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
which is what these are uh and everybody
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
now accepts that um which but it's still
 
03:28:59.870 --> 03:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
in the law that they're not allowed um
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
operation and is considered very
 
03:29:10.830 --> 03:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
different by a lot of people yeah the
 
03:29:12.990 --> 03:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
one thing I'll agree with is that there
 
03:29:14.830 --> 03:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
are certain facilities don't like there
 
03:29:17.189 --> 03:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
will there certain certain table games
 
03:29:19.550 --> 03:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
that require a lot more staff to cover
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
mhm yes I think roulette's one of them
 
03:29:24.309 --> 03:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
so I I remember going we took tours and
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
I was on this commission yeah we were on
 
03:29:26.160 --> 03:29:27.070 align:start position:0%
I was on this commission yeah we were on
the

03:29:27.070 --> 03:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
same years ago I was on the one too and
 
03:29:33.189 --> 03:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
I said why AR the ret Ms going they said
 
03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
because it it cost us too minutes we had
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
to have two two people covering it and
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
there weren't enough players so that
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's silent so but those are local
 
03:29:43.870 --> 03:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
decisions to to be made because you know
 
03:29:45.349 --> 03:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
this is in Vegas you know these are
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
smaller well they're getting bigger at
 
03:29:53.070 --> 03:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
opal um thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
03:30:04.000 --> 03:30:05.710 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
question

03:30:05.710 --> 03:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm genuinely curious um about
 
03:30:16.590 --> 03:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
the why you prefer optin versus opt out
 
03:30:19.510 --> 03:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
I mean as I understand
 
03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
it the the opt out provision basically
 
03:30:26.309 --> 03:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
says it's legal until the town votes
 
03:30:27.670 --> 03:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
right to say
 
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
no you're saying you would prefer an
 
03:30:33.189 --> 03:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
opin provision where it would be illegal
 
03:30:34.630 --> 03:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
other than the ones that are already
 
03:30:37.510 --> 03:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
existing or presumably as I understand
 
03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
the the the the bill if if you've
 
03:30:44.070 --> 03:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
already dropped in an application you
 
03:30:47.110 --> 03:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
would be permitted to go forward um but
 
03:30:49.990 --> 03:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
other than that it would be not legal
 
03:30:52.830 --> 03:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
until a town actually voted to permit it
 
03:30:54.910 --> 03:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm just I'm I'm really genuinely
 
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
curious about what you see as the
 
03:30:59.590 --> 03:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
difference well well well first off to
 
03:31:01.950 --> 03:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
be consistent with all of a lottery but
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
that's one so opt
 
03:31:07.110 --> 03:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
out I I I've said this before on
 
03:31:10.269 --> 03:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
different things including marijuana
 
03:31:12.670 --> 03:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
bills um I was always opt in as well
 
03:31:15.510 --> 03:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
because I thought that the town can miss
 
03:31:15.520 --> 03:31:16.870 align:start position:0%
because I thought that the town can miss
it

03:31:16.870 --> 03:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
they could they could miss it and not
 
03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know all of a sudden next thing you
 
03:31:21.710 --> 03:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
know you have a you have a a terrible
 
03:31:22.950 --> 03:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
gaming location that you don't want in
 
03:31:25.910 --> 03:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
your town because they missed it now
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
obviously this has to go through
 
03:31:29.070 --> 03:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
planning and stuff like that any of
 
03:31:31.950 --> 03:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
these things I understand but that's the
 
03:31:34.429 --> 03:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
only real logic that I have on it that
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
potentially this one you have to you
 
03:31:37.790 --> 03:31:37.800 align:start position:0%
have to have an affirmative vote if
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
someone wants to do
 
03:31:42.030 --> 03:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
it um and I I don't know I just think
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
it's a stronger stronger position myself
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:51.389 --> 03:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
representative om thank you Mr chairman
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
yeah P I have a question on the last
 
03:31:56.830 --> 03:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
comment you made about the u a town not
 
03:31:59.710 --> 03:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
being able to opt out if I get this
 
03:32:02.269 --> 03:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
correctly once they've got a device in
 
03:32:05.150 --> 03:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
their G in their in their
 
03:32:07.750 --> 03:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
vicinity and I'm specifically thinking
 
03:32:10.630 --> 03:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
about the nas casino here in NASA where
 
03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
there was never an opt-in vote by the
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
citizens of NASA to allow historic
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
racing now we have a large facility
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
coming our way and that may or may not
 
03:32:20.720 --> 03:32:21.469 align:start position:0%
coming our way and that may or may not
be

03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:32:23.389 --> 03:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
controversial but if it does become
 
03:32:25.269 --> 03:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
controversial it seems to me that
 
03:32:29.309 --> 03:32:29.319 align:start position:0%
there's no ability in this bill to go
 
03:32:30.990 --> 03:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
into an opt out provision because it's
 
03:32:33.229 --> 03:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
already grandfathered is that
 
03:32:35.590 --> 03:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
correct all right the these current
 
03:32:37.309 --> 03:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
facilities are grandfathered now in the
 
03:32:40.349 --> 03:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
case of nasua you had three we have
 
03:32:40.359 --> 03:32:41.429 align:start position:0%
case of nasua you had three we have
three

03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:32:44.910 --> 03:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
facilities two have merged to become
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
they'll stop operating become the Nash
 
03:32:48.269 --> 03:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
and then you'll still have and it's a
 
03:32:49.710 --> 03:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
Gateway is that the one the other one is
 
03:32:51.790 --> 03:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
Gateway I think or something like that
 
03:32:53.150 --> 03:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
so you're going to have two still have
 
03:32:55.189 --> 03:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
two casinos where but Nash is going to
 
03:33:01.990 --> 03:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
again if you ask the question well if we
 
03:33:06.189 --> 03:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
have this
 
03:33:08.110 --> 03:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
position if that
 
03:33:11.670 --> 03:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
merger perhaps if those two facilities
 
03:33:14.750 --> 03:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
decide to create a singular
 
03:33:18.550 --> 03:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
license this may apply I'm not 100% sure
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
the way the language is which may be
 
03:33:25.750 --> 03:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh because it's it's they're
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
not the same old two facilities that
 
03:33:29.389 --> 03:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
existed that came together
 
03:33:31.750 --> 03:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
and but I'm not 100% sure if this
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
language would cover that or not if that
 
03:33:36.110 --> 03:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
I think that's your question but it's
 
03:33:37.830 --> 03:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
too late now I mean that they're they're
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
protected from this language they are
 
03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
protected because that anyone who had a
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
license in process obviously they have
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
their license now but when we first did
 
03:33:50.590 --> 03:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
the language in the report they they did
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay now they have their license um and
 
03:33:56.349 --> 03:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
Lottery can correct me about that but um
 
03:33:57.510 --> 03:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
I'm quite sure they have they're about
 
03:34:01.630 --> 03:34:01.640 align:start position:0%
to open right pretty soon yes indeed I
 
03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
guess the reason I'm asking the question
 
03:34:04.910 --> 03:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
03:34:07.189 --> 03:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
true that the city of
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
nashwa never had the ability to opt in
 
03:34:13.870 --> 03:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
for historic horse racing machines yeah
 
03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
and I and I stated my reasoning for that
 
03:34:18.309 --> 03:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
is that when we did the historic racing
 
03:34:21.870 --> 03:34:21.880 align:start position:0%
bill which I was a prime sponsor
 
03:34:25.950 --> 03:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
and we we said because there was some
 
03:34:28.950 --> 03:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about that and we said what
 
03:34:31.389 --> 03:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is the facilities
 
03:34:33.510 --> 03:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
not the games that are in the
 
03:34:37.150 --> 03:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
facility to me CH by adding the historic
 
03:34:41.309 --> 03:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
racing machines we were adding a game to
 
03:34:42.990 --> 03:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
facilities that
 
03:34:46.990 --> 03:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
existed so it was how do you
 
03:34:49.790 --> 03:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know so that that was the logic then
 
03:34:52.349 --> 03:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
obviously the legislature agreed with me
 
03:34:55.830 --> 03:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
that because we passed the bill so but
 
03:34:59.550 --> 03:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
that was the logic uh we weren't adding
 
03:35:01.870 --> 03:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
a different kind of facility we were we
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
were the facility
 
03:35:06.189 --> 03:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
existed we're adding just like we have
 
03:35:08.389 --> 03:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
roulette or we have the cops table we're
 
03:35:09.990 --> 03:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
adding some some historic racing
 
03:35:13.309 --> 03:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
machines now so we went to Mechanical
 
03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
play as well as just regular table play
 
03:35:19.429 --> 03:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
so that was the logic then we discussed
 
03:35:21.469 --> 03:35:21.479 align:start position:0%
it I think we discussed it in this this
 
03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
committee at the time uh that was always
 
03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
the argument and U and that's what
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.870 --> 03:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
so represent you said Thank you Mr
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
chairman if I may just to maybe help
 
03:35:42.189 --> 03:35:42.199 align:start position:0%
answer that question at the time also
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
they were Lucky Seven machines in office
 
03:35:48.429 --> 03:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
operation at the same time many people
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
considered those slot machines at the
 
03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
same time and I I concur it was
 
03:35:54.790 --> 03:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
basically we were adding a different
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
game so it wasn't a a completely new
 
03:36:01.030 --> 03:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
operation or anything it was adding a
 
03:36:03.870 --> 03:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
game a component game to what was
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
already in place
 
03:36:09.870 --> 03:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair can I respond to that sure
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
03:36:13.790 --> 03:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
so if you guys had a Lucky Seven bill
 
03:36:16.030 --> 03:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
yet this year uh lucky s kind of fading
 
03:36:18.750 --> 03:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
out after now that's historic racing uh
 
03:36:23.229 --> 03:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 was was it used to be the P tabs
 
03:36:24.870 --> 03:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
I mean I had I knew none of this until I
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
was on Wast of Me by the way um and and
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
it really was what saved Bingo for many
 
03:36:33.790 --> 03:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
years because they never made we have a
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
bunch of Bingo parlers around the state
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
still that are licensed and and um again
 
03:36:43.309 --> 03:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
that's an older person's game and uh and
 
03:36:45.229 --> 03:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
it that's fading but they they couldn't
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
make it alone just on the Bingo playing
 
03:36:50.229 --> 03:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
they did the pull s people like to play
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
the and then someone somewhere along the
 
03:36:54.830 --> 03:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
line decided Well why do we have the
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
person going around sing the P tickets
 
03:36:58.429 --> 03:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
why don't we have them in a dispensing
 
03:37:01.870 --> 03:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
machine and it's so there's these Lucky
 
03:37:03.630 --> 03:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
Seven machines is
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
what representative said is talking
 
03:37:08.790 --> 03:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
about and so some argued I guess yes
 
03:37:10.349 --> 03:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
some did argue that well we already have
 
03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
these mechanical machines already called
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 and and actually some of the
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
Lucky 7 machines
 
03:37:17.950 --> 03:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
some of the facilities had a license for
 
03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
Bingo as well as charitable gaming
 
03:37:23.630 --> 03:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
separate okay it was separate license to
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
do Bingo and they actually had I think
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is some of
 
03:37:31.990 --> 03:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
them had some of them had the uh the uh
 
03:37:35.189 --> 03:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
the P the lucky s machines there they're
 
03:37:37.630 --> 03:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
all gone now because most of the
 
03:37:39.750 --> 03:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
facilities got rid of bingo uh but
 
03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line of this
 
03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
revolution of charitable gaming it's
 
03:37:44.030 --> 03:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
they were
 
03:37:47.070 --> 03:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
there represent um yeah if I could if I
 
03:37:48.990 --> 03:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
could follow up I just want to clarify
 
03:37:52.309 --> 03:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
that uh Lucky Sevens and such are
 
03:37:55.950 --> 03:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
considered Class 2 Gaming uh
 
03:37:59.830 --> 03:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
regulations and they're not random uh
 
03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
machines like a slap machine class three
 
03:38:04.830 --> 03:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
devices are slot machines and class
 
03:38:06.950 --> 03:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
three devices are historic horse racing
 
03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
machines so I make the point that even
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
though City may have had class two
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
gaming in place that the transition from
 
03:38:17.389 --> 03:38:17.399 align:start position:0%
class 2 Gaming to class three gaming
 
03:38:19.150 --> 03:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
there's a major change which has caused
 
03:38:22.990 --> 03:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
the explosion of the popularity of the
 
03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the machines in Nasha and cause the
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
sale of these locations from small mom
 
03:38:31.309 --> 03:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
and pop stores to Major large operations
 
03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
in major parts of the city right and
 
03:38:35.670 --> 03:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
consequently because that change has
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
been implemented I would think that the
 
03:38:41.349 --> 03:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
cities and towns affected by class three
 
03:38:43.950 --> 03:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
gaming devices should have the ability
 
03:38:46.269 --> 03:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
to opt out would you agree
 
03:38:49.710 --> 03:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
no because yeah yes if there a new city
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a a a terrible gaming
 
03:38:56.429 --> 03:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
location but Nashville no I mean you you
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
can't you can't I mean it's a pad look
 
03:39:02.189 --> 03:39:02.199 align:start position:0%
say oh we're going to pass you just
 
03:39:04.910 --> 03:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
invested uh you know $50 million to
 
03:39:08.910 --> 03:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
renovate this store into a casino and oh
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
now we're going to pass a law that says
 
03:39:14.110 --> 03:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
oh the community can can say no after
 
03:39:17.389 --> 03:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
the fact that the that won't fly I mean
 
03:39:18.990 --> 03:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
that's that would be a bad legislation
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
bad luck uh but if it's another if it's
 
03:39:24.870 --> 03:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
a new new town that wants to with this
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
legislation say no F I'm fine with
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
that and by the way I I agree with you
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
on yes they they're class two versus
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
class three you're correct on that I
 
03:39:39.070 --> 03:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that uh it was a step
 
03:39:43.070 --> 03:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
up follow follow up Yeah final question
 
03:39:45.429 --> 03:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience with me uh
 
03:39:47.110 --> 03:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
you believe that do you believe that
 
03:39:49.910 --> 03:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
once a location has been given a license
 
03:39:51.710 --> 03:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
for a casino which is typically a
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
three-year license that that license
 
03:39:56.670 --> 03:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
should remain in place in
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
perpetuity or do you think that should
 
03:40:00.510 --> 03:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
have the means to be renewed every three
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
referendum the license gets re renewed
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
every year or again the the employer
 
03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
whatever I said license that's the
 
03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
license that's the license but they have
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
to be in good
 
03:40:19.550 --> 03:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
standing if if and got to remember we
 
03:40:21.070 --> 03:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
have we have inspectors that check out
 
03:40:23.590 --> 03:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
these casinos they these terrible gaming
 
03:40:25.349 --> 03:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
locations there's a whole division there
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
that that does that AG is involved as
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
well making sure that that so if all of
 
03:40:31.790 --> 03:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
a sudden we discover there's a lot of
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
cheating going on or there's all sorts
 
03:40:35.469 --> 03:40:35.479 align:start position:0%
of of Hanky Panky going on with the
 
03:40:37.790 --> 03:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
counting of the money and all of
 
03:40:40.229 --> 03:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
this facility can lose their
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
license once they lose their license
 
03:40:45.630 --> 03:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
then I think this will apply so it's a
 
03:40:48.670 --> 03:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
real incentive for them to to to play by
 
03:40:50.830 --> 03:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
the roles and
 
03:40:53.189 --> 03:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
we and the Consultants we use check
 
03:40:54.469 --> 03:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
03:40:58.630 --> 03:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
out uh and uh and they they they looked
 
03:41:00.750 --> 03:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
at our rules and our the law our
 
03:41:04.070 --> 03:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
statutes and our rules associated with
 
03:41:06.269 --> 03:41:06.279 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and they gave us a
 
03:41:08.150 --> 03:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
clean bill of health they said no you
 
03:41:09.510 --> 03:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of the you have a lot of the
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
safeguards in place to prevent any any
 
03:41:14.349 --> 03:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
problems and you're you're doing the
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
right auditing needs to be done like any
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
other Casino I think some of the rules
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
are as stringent as some of the bigger
 
03:41:24.229 --> 03:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
casinos that you see around the country
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
and because we use this National firm to
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
evaluate this for us with with those
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
eyes with those that vision of what
 
03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
should we see and we said we want to be
 
03:41:35.950 --> 03:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
the hand highest standard possible and
 
03:41:38.349 --> 03:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
we got a clean bill of health so thank
 
03:41:42.149 --> 03:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you um seeing no more
 
03:41:47.790 --> 03:41:47.800 align:start position:0%

03:42:26.950 --> 03:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
testimony and I have some additional uh
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
things to go go through I live in
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
Littleton we're very proud of our little
 
03:42:34.349 --> 03:42:34.359 align:start position:0%
town north of the notch 6,000 people
 
03:42:36.790 --> 03:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
with 42
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants we have industry we have
 
03:42:42.510 --> 03:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
shopping we have a very healthy Main
 
03:42:44.830 --> 03:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
Street we have a wholesome tourist
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
indust his for seasons and we're just
 
03:42:51.070 --> 03:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
Mighty proud and uh love our little
 
03:42:55.429 --> 03:42:55.439 align:start position:0%
wholesome town uh we were surprised and
 
03:42:59.750 --> 03:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
um taken aback when a casino uh held a
 
03:43:01.429 --> 03:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
meeting at the high school telling us
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
they were coming in there with nothing
 
03:43:05.229 --> 03:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
we can do about it it was going to be
 
03:43:08.149 --> 03:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
happening and um it was quite alarming
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
to the community of more than a 100
 
03:43:14.750 --> 03:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
people came uh 27 spoke 95% of the
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
people had
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
very negative um reactions to the news
 
03:43:23.630 --> 03:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
and uh I was among them uh we put
 
03:43:26.910 --> 03:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
together we read through the statute and
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
the reports that had come through
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
minority and majority reports and
 
03:43:33.149 --> 03:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
everything and we hooked on to an item
 
03:43:35.550 --> 03:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
that said that it could be handled by
 
03:43:38.110 --> 03:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
local ordinance so we put together a
 
03:43:40.990 --> 03:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
local ordinance to Pro the casino and it
 
03:43:45.590 --> 03:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
passed by 61 60% um in that same year
 
03:43:47.710 --> 03:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
and at the same time we got to the
 
03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
planning board and probably many of you
 
03:43:51.149 --> 03:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
are on planning boards and select boards
 
03:43:53.550 --> 03:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
as well I know you do a lot of work for
 
03:43:56.110 --> 03:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
the government and it's appreciated uh
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
my husband did serve on both as well so
 
03:44:01.389 --> 03:44:01.399 align:start position:0%
I know it's it's a lot of effort so I
 
03:44:04.030 --> 03:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um well we got into the
 
03:44:07.910 --> 03:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
planning Board review and they said wow
 
03:44:10.830 --> 03:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
this is very nice but it's not effective
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
the Dylan rle it has no bite at all and
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
so we immediately that was January 3D
 
03:44:20.429 --> 03:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
last year we immediately ran to the
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and we managed uh to find a
 
03:44:27.389 --> 03:44:27.399 align:start position:0%
Safe Harbor and um the municipal and
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
County which was seemed appropriate for
 
03:44:32.229 --> 03:44:32.239 align:start position:0%
policy such as this um even though it
 
03:44:35.030 --> 03:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
pertains to casinos it's about local um
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
issues and um it went through the
 
03:44:41.950 --> 03:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
committee we got in there and we um
 
03:44:45.550 --> 03:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
encountered the casino uh Lobby and
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
we ended up working together and working
 
03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
it out Rick Newman who you probably very
 
03:44:53.149 --> 03:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
much know and was very sad that he has
 
03:44:56.590 --> 03:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
passed he helped us and we came up with
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
a very good uh optin bill that we were
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
able to pass through the house um 280
 
03:45:07.389 --> 03:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
something to 86 which I thought was a
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
nice buffer when over to the Senate we
 
03:45:11.710 --> 03:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
got to the Senate and they turned it
 
03:45:14.030 --> 03:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
upside down and they said okay it needs
 
03:45:17.469 --> 03:45:17.479 align:start position:0%
to be Ed out not opt in uh because of
 
03:45:20.590 --> 03:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
the principle that they wanted it to be
 
03:45:22.229 --> 03:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
open for business
 
03:45:25.630 --> 03:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
unless there was a change and that so
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
that's what they did um we just want to
 
03:45:32.189 --> 03:45:32.199 align:start position:0%
have a say whether it's opt in or op out
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
one is a little bit more cumbersome opt
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
out's more cumbersome but nonetheless
 
03:45:38.349 --> 03:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
it's a say and during this me memor um
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
moratorium period um it gives towns and
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
cities across the state an opportunity
 
03:45:46.189 --> 03:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and oped out during this
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
period of time so I think that's fine
 
03:45:51.389 --> 03:45:51.399 align:start position:0%
it'll work out fine um there were a
 
03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
number of points that come up uh this is
 
03:45:56.670 --> 03:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan Bill we were able to get
 
03:45:59.590 --> 03:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
local and Statewide uh bipartisan
 
03:46:01.469 --> 03:46:01.479 align:start position:0%
support and really appreciate it because
 
03:46:04.870 --> 03:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue um I think
 
03:46:06.389 --> 03:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to make sure that we
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
keep government at the lowest element
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
possible there was a point that was
 
03:46:14.389 --> 03:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
brought up about having an incentive for
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
to play by the the rules and have this
 
03:46:18.990 --> 03:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
re this come up every three years and
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's not our intent that the towns
 
03:46:23.189 --> 03:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
would do that every three years we did
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
come up with the protection for the 14
 
03:46:28.110 --> 03:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
existing casinos and the five in the
 
03:46:30.429 --> 03:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
pipeline which unfortunately includes
 
03:46:32.590 --> 03:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
Littleton uh but Littleton supports the
 
03:46:34.590 --> 03:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
bill anyway even though it won't really
 
03:46:38.910 --> 03:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
protect Littleton but here I am in and
 
03:46:41.070 --> 03:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
advocating for you to go ahead and pass
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
this because it is good for all of the
 
03:46:45.510 --> 03:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
towns and all of the Cities
 
03:46:48.309 --> 03:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the every threeyear thing
 
03:46:50.030 --> 03:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't think it's important that the
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
towns do this every three years I think
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission and such can
 
03:46:57.550 --> 03:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
regulate the industry well and if
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
somebody's not adhering to their
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
regulations that they can do the kind of
 
03:47:04.510 --> 03:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
things they do put somebody on probation
 
03:47:06.189 --> 03:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
and such like that we don't need to
 
03:47:07.990 --> 03:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
involve the towns in a popular vote on
 
03:47:08.000 --> 03:47:08.870 align:start position:0%
involve the towns in a popular vote on
that

03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:11.750 --> 03:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
one um generating Revenue how much
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
revenue do we want to generate from
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
casinos and who's effective
 
03:47:17.830 --> 03:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
um the Charities there's the commission
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
will be looking at that and the previous
 
03:47:21.469 --> 03:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
commission looked at it very intensely
 
03:47:23.070 --> 03:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
of who benefits and what should be
 
03:47:25.510 --> 03:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
looked at in terms of charitable
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
distribution but you know if you had a
 
03:47:30.510 --> 03:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
casino in every single town in every
 
03:47:33.229 --> 03:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
city in the state you had six of them in
 
03:47:36.870 --> 03:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
every single bigger Town um you would
 
03:47:38.950 --> 03:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
really make less money because it just
 
03:47:40.910 --> 03:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as interesting to the
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
consumer and so there there's really not
 
03:47:46.469 --> 03:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
a need to have everywhere have every
 
03:47:49.510 --> 03:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
place have as many casinos as possible I
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that is the factor
 
03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
involved in generating renov revenue on
 
03:47:56.590 --> 03:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
this there is a lot of Revenue coming in
 
03:47:59.349 --> 03:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
and the the numbers are staggering the
 
03:48:00.590 --> 03:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
the one that would be coming to
 
03:48:03.750 --> 03:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
Littleton is projected to be
 
03:48:07.870 --> 03:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
um I call it draining uh $17 million out
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
of the local economy that's my
 
03:48:12.990 --> 03:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
perspective I'm entitled to that but in
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
any case uh around the state there's
 
03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
many many um dollars that are going into
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
the profits and there's a good chunk
 
03:48:24.510 --> 03:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
that goes to the the the Charities 35%
 
03:48:26.149 --> 03:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
on certainly of the games and other
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
games it's much slower but in the end um
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's a big piece of money to the
 
03:48:32.229 --> 03:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
Charities and we're hoping that will get
 
03:48:36.309 --> 03:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
um providing see in and
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.349 --> 03:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
there are some things in the amendment
 
03:48:50.750 --> 03:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
that are important um Alicia is going to
 
03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
speak to that and I really appreciate
 
03:48:54.469 --> 03:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
her work on this even before coming to
 
03:48:56.229 --> 03:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
your committee and she's been working
 
03:48:58.630 --> 03:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
with our sponsor uh representative Bill
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
Boyd and uh has come up with a couple of
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh things she she'd like to move some of
 
03:49:06.309 --> 03:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
the sections before the notwithstanding
 
03:49:09.870 --> 03:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
part uh which is fine with us um another
 
03:49:13.070 --> 03:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
thing is to make sure that the the years
 
03:49:15.309 --> 03:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
that are in your copy of this that says
 
03:49:18.429 --> 03:49:18.439 align:start position:0%
2 years for the abandonment sentence to
 
03:49:21.189 --> 03:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
kick in that wasn't our intent we
 
03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
understand that a Cino once it's
 
03:49:27.790 --> 03:49:27.800 align:start position:0%
invested there's a lot of money put into
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
these facilities and to have that
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
jeopardized in just for a
 
03:49:36.309 --> 03:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
two-year problem in in building or or
 
03:49:38.750 --> 03:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
Staffing and such that's not fair to the
 
03:49:42.030 --> 03:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
business and so um the first you have
 
03:49:45.070 --> 03:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
two and two right now it should be five
 
03:49:49.349 --> 03:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
and 10 that 5 years of Abandonment 10
 
03:49:51.309 --> 03:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
years if they never built that that
 
03:49:53.349 --> 03:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
would come up eligible to come up for a
 
03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
vote again that's one tiny little piece
 
03:49:56.159 --> 03:49:56.910 align:start position:0%
vote again that's one tiny little piece
that

03:49:56.910 --> 03:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:50:00.750 --> 03:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
Littleton takes some help in is that
 
03:50:02.309 --> 03:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll just never build it in
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
Littleton and then 15 years from now
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to get ourselves a a
 
03:50:11.510 --> 03:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
little vote anyway that's that's our um
 
03:50:13.990 --> 03:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of effort on this and
 
03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
it it had very Cooperative people

Alicia Preston I'm here representing the
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Charle gaming operators
 
03:50:57.630 --> 03:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
Association uh we are here in support of
 
03:50:59.189 --> 03:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
this legislation I know it's been
 
03:51:01.229 --> 03:51:01.239 align:start position:0%
something that has been being worked on
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
for um over a year and a request that
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
many lawmakers have wanted uh We've
 
03:51:08.229 --> 03:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
enjoyed working with the stakeholders in
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
this along with the sponsor um we do
 
03:51:14.030 --> 03:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
have a few tweaks to to this bill that
 
03:51:15.149 --> 03:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
we've requested
 
03:51:17.469 --> 03:51:17.479 align:start position:0%
representative boydd their minor
 
03:51:19.630 --> 03:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
language move pieces around nothing that
 
03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
affects the substance of the bill I
 
03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
believe um representative voy and we are
 
03:51:25.550 --> 03:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
all on the same page I haven't seen a
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
copy of that Amendment yet I'm not sure
 
03:51:28.630 --> 03:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
if it's ready so I can't weigh in on it
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
specifically um if you want me to get
 
03:51:32.269 --> 03:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
into details that's fine otherwise I
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
think when that Amendment comes it will
 
03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
reflect the minor concerns we have on
 
03:51:42.389 --> 03:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:45.990 --> 03:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill representa elme thank you I don't
 
03:51:48.830 --> 03:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
know who asked this question of so I'm
 
03:51:52.910 --> 03:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
going to ask you uh while they were
 
03:51:56.670 --> 03:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
moving into Lebanon they had to get
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
approval to move from the Central
 
03:52:01.389 --> 03:52:01.399 align:start position:0%
District where they were mostly
 
03:52:03.790 --> 03:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
affecting poor people and disabled
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
people um to um route four which is the
 
03:52:13.149 --> 03:52:13.159 align:start position:0%
main Corridor between east and west from
 
03:52:15.070 --> 03:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire through
 
03:52:18.670 --> 03:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
Vermont um and which was already pretty
 
03:52:23.110 --> 03:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
crowded and they um and they went before
 
03:52:26.790 --> 03:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
the planning board and they provided a
 
03:52:30.030 --> 03:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
traffic report which was based on the
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
city of Kean which if you've been to
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
Kean Keane is a smallish City surrounded
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
by large amounts of land where the inter
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
the the major roads go
 
03:52:49.229 --> 03:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
through so um it wasn't exactly
 
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
comparable with the most crowded part of
 
03:52:53.229 --> 03:52:53.239 align:start position:0%
Route 4 in
 
03:52:56.510 --> 03:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
Lebanon um and they asked them to
 
03:52:59.630 --> 03:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
provide yet another traffic report and
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
they came back with from what I
 
03:53:04.429 --> 03:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
understood essentially the same thing
 
03:53:06.550 --> 03:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
and they asked them for another and it
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
was pointed out that they were going to
 
03:53:13.269 --> 03:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
be violating I think its statute by uh
 
03:53:13.279 --> 03:53:15.110 align:start position:0%
be violating I think its statute by uh

re
 
03:53:19.429 --> 03:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
recalcitrant uh by not approving the
 
03:53:26.149 --> 03:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
thing in a appropriate amount of time
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they gave in and approved it and I
 
03:53:32.229 --> 03:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
am wondering if there is anything
 
03:53:35.550 --> 03:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
Lebanon can do if it turns out it's just
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
opened it's a little hard to tell how
 
03:53:41.070 --> 03:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
much further traffic disruption we're
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
going to have in that area it's just
 
03:53:47.830 --> 03:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
below where I come out of my Road um and
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
um if there is further traffic
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
disruption if there's
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
any any right that Lebanon has to get
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
some kind of compensation or
 
03:54:03.469 --> 03:54:03.479 align:start position:0%
whatever so I'm not as familiar with
 
03:54:05.750 --> 03:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
that specific situation as obviously you
 
03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
are um certainly this bill wouldn't
 
03:54:11.469 --> 03:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
address that this bill would strictly I
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
mean it's already a grandfathered in
 
03:54:15.269 --> 03:54:15.279 align:start position:0%
facility in Lebanon and there is nothing
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill that addresses what those
 
03:54:20.189 --> 03:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
concerns are um as for compensation from
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
the facility I'm just not familiar with
 
03:54:23.630 --> 03:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
what the rules regulations and approvals
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon
 
03:54:28.110 --> 03:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
are yeah well I don't think Lebanon has
 
03:54:32.910 --> 03:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
much choice but uh unless there's
 
03:54:36.750 --> 03:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
something in the statute somewhere
 
03:54:39.830 --> 03:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
that does something about
 
03:54:43.309 --> 03:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
that thank you any other
 
03:54:45.750 --> 03:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%

here was there anyone else that wanted
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%

on HB 635
 
04:06:44.880 --> 04:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
on HB 635
and

04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%

04:06:48.710 --> 04:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh ask representative corkran to
 
04:06:49.870 --> 04:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
introduce the
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill howdy thank you for having me so um
 
04:06:56.189 --> 04:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
fundamentally this is a bill about who
 
04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
and who does not get nonprofit status in
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and it's a small
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
administrative change and uh this is my
 
04:07:04.349 --> 04:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
summary but you know just
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
extemporaneously I'm going to move it to
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
the front which is nonprofit status is
 
04:07:11.070 --> 04:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
not a right of any entity there are many
 
04:07:12.830 --> 04:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
pro-social groups in the State uh
 
04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
hanford's brings us food Auto fire Honda
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
sells me uh cars but they uh do not get
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit status the state chooses to
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
give nonprofit status as a tool of
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
public policy to achieve ends that it
 
04:07:27.309 --> 04:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
wishes to
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
achieve there's a vast powerful and
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
extremely well-funded network of
 
04:07:33.070 --> 04:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that profit by settling un
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
assemblable foreigners in New Hampshire
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
they call themselves nonprofits but that
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
phrase merely means that there are no
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
shareholders the profits that they make
 
04:07:41.750 --> 04:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
are instead distributed to employees or
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
retained by settling skilled foreigners
 
04:07:45.309 --> 04:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they create massive
 
04:07:47.469 --> 04:07:47.479 align:start position:0%
negative externalities Carnage really
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
and they get paid and paid well for
 
04:07:51.149 --> 04:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
doing it I can think of no better way to
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
illustrate this then by looking over the
 
04:07:53.590 --> 04:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that was submitted to the
 
04:07:54.910 --> 04:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee last night by the New
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire immigrant rights Network who
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
is this and who are some of the
 
04:08:00.790 --> 04:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
co-signers of the letter we can find out
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
by find pulling the form uh 990s from
 
04:08:05.910 --> 04:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
the IRS the short answer is that these
 
04:08:08.990 --> 04:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
firms are big very big it's important to
 
04:08:09.990 --> 04:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
realize when looking over these
 
04:08:11.590 --> 04:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
financial statements that these NOS are
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
funded in two ways by government G
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
grants directly um or uh indirectly
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
laundered through other Nos and also by
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
program revenues which is just a
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
different way is saying by government
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
grants program revenues is where the
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
government either New Hampshire or at
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
the federal level says to an NGO we're
 
04:08:30.590 --> 04:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
going to pay you effectively $300 for
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
every person that you you know provide
 
04:08:34.349 --> 04:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
service X or Y or Z
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
for and so excuse me going through some
 
04:08:41.149 --> 04:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
of the uh constituent parts of the New
 
04:08:42.990 --> 04:08:43.000 align:start position:0%

Care Alliance is getting from tax
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
dollars is uh I've seen various numbers
 
04:10:04.269 --> 04:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
the lowest number is $120 million a year
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
if you add all of these up there is a
 
04:10:09.710 --> 04:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
NGO uh Network that is getting paid on
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
the order of $250 million a year mostly
 
04:10:15.030 --> 04:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
to deal with settling foreigners in and
 
04:10:17.510 --> 04:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
around New Hampshire this money all
 
04:10:19.630 --> 04:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
comes from taxpayer Pockets or the vast
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
majority of it does and as I said some
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
of it is by direct government grants
 
04:10:25.630 --> 04:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
some of it uh is indirect through other
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
Nos and some of it is by government
 
04:10:32.149 --> 04:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
grants that are per uh person
 
04:10:34.550 --> 04:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
fees there's a question um you know a
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
lot of this is not explicitly said to be
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
for illegals it is for you know refugees
 
04:10:42.030 --> 04:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
or immigrants or new granite Staters
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
Etc um
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
and if you dig into the various websites
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
of these firms that are getting this
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
government largess and then getting
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
nonprofit status so that they're not
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
taxed on it um
 
04:10:56.109 --> 04:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
they are a little bit koi about exactly
 
04:10:58.510 --> 04:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
who they're serving some of them uh you
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
know first of all no one is going to use
 
04:11:01.670 --> 04:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
the word illegal immigrant uh even
 
04:11:04.269 --> 04:11:04.279 align:start position:0%
though that is the legal term uh they
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
will use other terms but um they also
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
talk about some of the services they
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
provide and uh let's see the national
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
immigration law Center which is part of
 
04:11:15.990 --> 04:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
this Coalition uh brags on its website
 
04:11:18.030 --> 04:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
about how it has engaged in programs to
 
04:11:19.750 --> 04:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
allow illegals to enter and stay in the
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
US and how they work to uh defend their
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
status and engage with the government
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
and Lobby uh for changes in policy so
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
that enforcement actions are not taken
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
the letter that you all received last
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
night from the New Hampshire immigrant
 
04:11:33.070 --> 04:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
rights network is worth reading
 
04:11:35.149 --> 04:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
carefully it first engages in an
 
04:11:36.870 --> 04:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
irrelevant and diversionary tactic by
 
04:11:39.070 --> 04:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
saying quote this unnecessary Bill
 
04:11:41.309 --> 04:11:41.319 align:start position:0%
appears rooted in the misconception that
 
04:11:43.389 --> 04:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
non-citizens even undocumented ones are
 
04:11:45.389 --> 04:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
given public benefits this is an
 
04:11:47.950 --> 04:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely false claim legal aliens are
 
04:11:49.469 --> 04:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
eligible for many taxpayer provided
 
04:11:51.550 --> 04:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
benefits including not just Wick which
 
04:11:53.870 --> 04:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
is what welfare is called but also all
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
the services provided by the nhn members
 
04:11:58.389 --> 04:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
such as housing food Furniture
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
Transportation legal assistance and more
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
which are paid for with taxpayer money
 
04:12:03.670 --> 04:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
via grants and program revenues which
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
again is taxpayer
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
money nhn and its letter then goes on to
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
say that it is lawful to provide
 
04:12:11.109 --> 04:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
services to New Hampshire residents some
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
of whom may be illegal this is uh claim
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to mutay the waters excuse
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
me this bill does not argue that
 
04:12:20.429 --> 04:12:20.439 align:start position:0%
providing services to illegal aliens is
 
04:12:22.510 --> 04:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
itself illegal this bill merely notes
 
04:12:24.349 --> 04:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
that nonprofit status is not a right but
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
a benefit that the government of New
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire extends to certain
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
organizations if they are engaged in
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
certain pro-social activities as defined
 
04:12:34.030 --> 04:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
in RSA 292 colon 1 RSA 292 extends the
 
04:12:35.469 --> 04:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
status to organizations that maintain
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
cemeteries but not to organizations that
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
sell televisions it extends the status
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
to organizations that plant trees but
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
not to organizations that arrange cars
 
04:12:46.109 --> 04:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
races nonprofit status is a policy tool
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
of the people of New Hampshire and it
 
04:12:48.830 --> 04:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
may be extended or withdrawn to achieve
 
04:12:49.790 --> 04:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
the goals that the people of New
 
04:12:52.590 --> 04:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wish to uh
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
achieve another thing that the nhn
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
letter says is that it would be
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
implausible for them to make sure that
 
04:13:02.229 --> 04:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
the people they serve uh are legal this
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
is a claim but it's not a claim that I
 
04:13:07.149 --> 04:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
uh agree with ever verify is a free
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
service offered by the US government
 
04:13:09.910 --> 04:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
that confirms the legal status of a
 
04:13:12.670 --> 04:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
person eify is required to be used by
 
04:13:16.750 --> 04:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
all Pro uh for-profit companies if I uh
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
am running a lawn care service and I
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
want to hire people I'm required to

verify that they're citizens or
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise eligible for employment uh and
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
legal status in the United States the
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
website explains that this takes 3 to 5
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
Seconds nhn says in its letter this bill
 
04:13:34.189 --> 04:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
would Place New Hampshire nonprofit
 
04:13:35.830 --> 04:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
organizations in the precarious position
 
04:13:37.109 --> 04:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
of making determinations about
 
04:13:38.710 --> 04:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
immigration status of the individuals
 
04:13:41.070 --> 04:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
and families seeking
 
04:13:42.830 --> 04:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
assistance are we to believe that
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
through 5c verification process that
 
04:13:46.349 --> 04:13:46.359 align:start position:0%
every single for-profit employer in New
 
04:13:48.109 --> 04:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses is impossible for firms
 
04:13:49.269 --> 04:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
that make their profits not from
 
04:13:51.070 --> 04:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
providing benefits to the public but
 
04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
from receiving government grants the
 
04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
letter concludes with the claim this
 
04:13:56.790 --> 04:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
bill is designed to Shield the provision
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
of the services to non-citizens this is
 
04:14:01.030 --> 04:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
the logical fallacy of appeal to motive
 
04:14:02.830 --> 04:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
and the claim is incorrect this bill is
 
04:14:04.830 --> 04:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
designed not to uh chill the provision
 
04:14:06.670 --> 04:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
of services to non-citizens many of whom
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
are legally allowed to reside in New
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but to chill the provision of
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
services to illegal aliens who
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
definitely do not
 
04:14:15.389 --> 04:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about the effects of
 
04:14:17.070 --> 04:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
importing foreigners to New
 
04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire excuse me um nhn talks about
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
the good works of the New Hampshire ngi
 
04:14:26.670 --> 04:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
uh NOS I'd like to ex examine the claim
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh kinds of the NOS that they're
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
composed of and if these are
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
supported um for most of my information
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
on the effect of uh bringing forers to
 
04:14:40.189 --> 04:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I uh am referencing a
 
04:14:42.870 --> 04:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
report published by UNH this report is
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
the the refugee resettlement in New
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Pathways to building community
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
and I want to note that this studied uh
 
04:14:51.870 --> 04:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
primarily refugees um which is not the
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
same as in legal status as far as
 
04:14:56.189 --> 04:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants but is the best data
 
04:14:57.910 --> 04:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
that is available on settling
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
non-americans in New Hampshire this
 
04:15:02.229 --> 04:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
report was written by Nina Glick
 
04:15:06.429 --> 04:15:06.439 align:start position:0%
Schiller PhD uh Professor UNH Jerry and
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
bores UNH Molly messenger UNH and some
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
statistics and I want to point out this
 
04:15:13.870 --> 04:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
is a report that is bragging about the
 
04:15:16.830 --> 04:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
integration success that uh these uh
 
04:15:18.790 --> 04:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
types of immigrants have achieved and so
 
04:15:20.590 --> 04:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
this is the Steelman the you know let's
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
round every number up let's put a
 
04:15:24.189 --> 04:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
positive spin on everything and so I'm
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
not looking at the Pat Buchanan
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
anti-immigration fund I'm not you know
 
04:15:30.149 --> 04:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
quoting David Duke or anything
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%

04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
rootless uh speaking to goals of chain
 
04:15:51.630 --> 04:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
migration page 12 quoting one person the
 
04:15:52.990 --> 04:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
highest thing I can think of is to try
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
to bring my family members here page 27
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
top three goals of the population
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
include bringing their family to the
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
US one of the goals is public
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
assistance page 15 table four um percent
 
04:16:09.109 --> 04:16:09.119 align:start position:0%

Section 8 housing 26% percent using Wick
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%

Medicaid 34% percent using food pantries
 
04:16:21.510 --> 04:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
38% percent on food stamps
 
04:16:25.149 --> 04:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
53% um at least 90% of this population
 
04:16:27.189 --> 04:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
has at some point been either on food
 
04:16:31.149 --> 04:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
stamps indor Medicaid page 19 25% of
 
04:16:33.429 --> 04:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
them are unemployed of those who do work
 
04:16:35.189 --> 04:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
many of them were not working
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
full-time um the study goes on to say uh
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is from sort of the activist
 
04:16:42.189 --> 04:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
perspective at UNH and this is uh with
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
overlapping personnel and um goals as
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
the NGS um that one of the uh problems
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
is that there is not enough federal or
 
04:16:54.429 --> 04:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
state housing benefits and we need to
 
04:16:55.550 --> 04:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
extend to
 
04:16:58.990 --> 04:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
that um some of the problems that the
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
you know again generally pro-immigration
 
04:17:03.229 --> 04:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
report noted is that refugees have a
 
04:17:04.750 --> 04:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
complaint they complain that there are
 
04:17:06.349 --> 04:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
laws against public drinking and against
 
04:17:06.359 --> 04:17:07.229 align:start position:0%
laws against public drinking and against
public

04:17:07.229 --> 04:17:07.239 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
congregation um also on page 24 the
 
04:17:11.309 --> 04:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
report also notes that there is a
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
problem with the American legal system
 
04:17:15.790 --> 04:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
because we enforce rules against uh
 
04:17:18.309 --> 04:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
beating children and this is hard to
 
04:17:21.149 --> 04:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
reconcile with uh some foreign cultures
 
04:17:22.830 --> 04:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
quote immigrants believe that the
 
04:17:24.830 --> 04:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
lessons contributed in schools about
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
children not being beaten contributed to
 
04:17:28.109 --> 04:17:28.119 align:start position:0%
undermining parental Authority they
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
believe that the lack of respect for
 
04:17:31.910 --> 04:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
elders is a far greater offense than the
 
04:17:34.109 --> 04:17:34.119 align:start position:0%
physical punishment of
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
children um another problem with the uh
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
immigration process and the you know
 
04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
kinds of people that the NOS are
 
04:17:43.389 --> 04:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
bringing in
 
04:17:44.710 --> 04:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
is that we are importing ethnic
 
04:17:47.670 --> 04:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
rivalries on page 25 of this report they
 
04:17:50.070 --> 04:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
talk about tensions that exist overseas
 
04:17:51.389 --> 04:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
that are being brought here as members
 
04:17:53.149 --> 04:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
of competing tribes are settled in the
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
same place um and then finally I'd like
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
to wrap up with a few local news stories
 
04:18:00.550 --> 04:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
about some of the enrichment that these
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
NGS are helping to deliver to conquered
 
04:18:08.429 --> 04:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
uh patch.com um two days ago um has a
 
04:18:13.590 --> 04:18:13.600 align:start position:0%

04:18:51.630 --> 04:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
days before that uh three Chinese
 
04:18:53.149 --> 04:18:53.159 align:start position:0%

after being accused of previous rapes in
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
the same complex
 
04:19:15.030 --> 04:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm about to hit the summary so I
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
apologize for the very long-winded thing
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
um the motivation behind a lot of the
 
04:19:24.870 --> 04:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
NOS doing the resettlement work uh work
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
where they you know are dealing with
 
04:19:29.189 --> 04:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
lots of populations and they you know
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
assert that you know they can't tell if
 
04:19:32.590 --> 04:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
any of these are illegal and they
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to check because
 
04:19:35.870 --> 04:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're getting paid per person that
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
they provide these Services too um at
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
least one of the upsides is that we're
 
04:19:41.950 --> 04:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
achieving diversity and there have been
 
04:19:43.630 --> 04:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
many articles New York Times and other
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
places talking about you know a lot of
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
places are achieving these great
 
04:19:48.389 --> 04:19:48.399 align:start position:0%
successes but sadly a few States like
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are lagging behind we do
 
04:19:52.349 --> 04:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
not have the diversity that uh the rest
 
04:19:54.750 --> 04:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
of the country uh is sometimes blessed
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
with and I want to quote from a New York
 
04:20:01.070 --> 04:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
Times article uh 2007 entitled the
 
04:20:03.630 --> 04:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
downside of diversity and again uh I
 
04:20:05.469 --> 04:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
challenged myself to uh bring up
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
statistics only that came from the left
 
04:20:08.710 --> 04:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle not from you know
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
anything questionable and you know
 
04:20:13.510 --> 04:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
strange and rightwing uh I will
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh constrain myself to only quoting from
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
The New York Times it has become
 
04:20:19.389 --> 04:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
increasingly popular to speak of racial
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
and ethnic diversity as a Civic strength
 
04:20:22.910 --> 04:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
from Multicultural festivals to
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
pronouncements from political leaders
 
04:20:25.870 --> 04:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
the message is the same our differences
 
04:20:28.030 --> 04:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
make us stronger but a massive new study
 
04:20:29.670 --> 04:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
based on detailed interviews with nearly
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
30,000 people has concluded just the
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
opposite Harvard political scientist
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
Robert putam famous for his book bowling
 
04:20:37.710 --> 04:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
alone on declining Civic engagement has
 
04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
found that the greater the diversity in
 
04:20:40.750 --> 04:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
a community the fewer people vote and
 
04:20:42.389 --> 04:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
the less they volunteer the less they
 
04:20:43.950 --> 04:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
give to charity and work on community
 
04:20:45.870 --> 04:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
projects in the most diverse communities
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
neighbors trust one another about half
 
04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
as much as they do in the most
 
04:20:50.429 --> 04:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
homogenous settings the study the
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
largest ever on Civic engagement in
 
04:20:53.630 --> 04:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
America found that virtually all
 
04:20:55.269 --> 04:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
measures of Civic Health are lower in
 
04:20:57.590 --> 04:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
more diverse settings quote the extent
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
of the effect is shocking end quote says

political
 
04:21:04.229 --> 04:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
scientist this study to the best of my
 
04:21:06.070 --> 04:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
research has never been refuted or
 
04:21:08.429 --> 04:21:08.439 align:start position:0%
modified with any other studies so
 
04:21:09.910 --> 04:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
speaking directly to the bill and
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
summing up there's nothing in this bill
 
04:21:15.870 --> 04:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
that stops any of these NOS from dealing
 
04:21:18.990 --> 04:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
with uh refugees designated by the US
 
04:21:20.429 --> 04:21:20.439 align:start position:0%
government there's nothing to stop them
 
04:21:23.550 --> 04:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
from dealing with um first generation
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
immigrants or second IM generation
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
immigrants and there is actually nothing
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
that stops them from providing services
 
04:21:31.389 --> 04:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
to illegal aliens we are not policing
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
that they can do whatever they want they
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
can uh open food pantries to illegal
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
aliens they can provide them uh
 
04:21:39.870 --> 04:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
Apartments the only thing it does it
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
says the state of New Hampshire the
 
04:21:43.469 --> 04:21:43.479 align:start position:0%
government of the State of New Hampshire
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
is tasked with figuring out what our
 
04:21:47.550 --> 04:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
social priorities are and we use our tax
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
policy to implement these social
 
04:21:51.389 --> 04:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
priorities you can do lots of things you
 
04:21:54.030 --> 04:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
can run a dog adoption center you can do
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
community gardening you can have a uh
 
04:21:58.870 --> 04:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
little Library all of those things get
 
04:22:02.670 --> 04:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit status but if you uh engage in
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
the active settlement of illegal aliens
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you're allowed to do
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
that it's not our job to stop you it's
 
04:22:10.349 --> 04:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
just that we are not going to reward you
 
04:22:12.670 --> 04:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
with nonprofit status thank thank you
 
04:22:15.030 --> 04:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
for your time and I welcome any
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
this you have two separate definitions
 
04:22:31.469 --> 04:22:31.479 align:start position:0%
of business
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
Enterprise which contradict each
 
04:22:34.199 --> 04:22:37.070 align:start position:0%
Enterprise which contradict each
other

04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
um that's line three and then again on
 
04:22:39.760 --> 04:22:40.990 align:start position:0%
um that's line three and then again on
line

04:22:40.990 --> 04:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:22:44.670 --> 04:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
19 um you
 
04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
don't Define what engaged in means or
 
04:22:52.750 --> 04:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
attempting to engage in I and your
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
discussion of the impact of illegal
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
aliens was correct but it didn't apply
 
04:23:00.349 --> 04:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
to how this bill is going to be
 
04:23:03.030 --> 04:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
implemented or operated
 
04:23:05.469 --> 04:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
or or what it
 
04:23:09.269 --> 04:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
does um your definition of illegal
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
immigrant is
 
04:23:15.790 --> 04:23:15.800 align:start position:0%
interesting although I don't think since
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as an illegal
 
04:23:20.670 --> 04:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
immigrant under federal law you can't
 
04:23:22.990 --> 04:23:23.000 align:start position:0%
use federal law to Define it there are
 
04:23:23.000 --> 04:23:24.269 align:start position:0%
use federal law to Define it there are
illegal

04:23:24.269 --> 04:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
aliens under the code but there's no
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:35.790 --> 04:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
immigrant what is um question ask well
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
this is constitutional questions as the
 
04:23:42.590 --> 04:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
Constitutional question is with the the
 
04:23:45.030 --> 04:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
way this language is set up and under
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
our rules as you know the vice chair's
 
04:23:49.109 --> 04:23:49.119 align:start position:0%
task with that
 
04:23:53.149 --> 04:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
job um take a society like uh St Vincent
 
04:23:55.389 --> 04:23:55.399 align:start position:0%
the Paul which does a great deal of good
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
work in
 
04:23:59.149 --> 04:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
providing all sorts of services to
 
04:24:01.630 --> 04:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
individuals that need service their
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
Charter as a religious organization says
 
04:24:08.550 --> 04:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
you come to the door you seek food and
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give it to
 
04:24:13.550 --> 04:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
you but your
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
definition would seemingly point of
 
04:24:17.950 --> 04:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
order is there a question it's a
 
04:24:17.960 --> 04:24:21.109 align:start position:0%
order is there a question it's a
constitutional

04:24:21.109 --> 04:24:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:24.269 --> 04:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
question would seemingly
 
04:24:27.630 --> 04:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
violate the Constitutional ban on
 
04:24:30.910 --> 04:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
interference in religion respectfully I
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
disagree um the society is absolutely
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
free to do anything it wants nothing in
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
them except they would be taxed to do so
 
04:24:45.149 --> 04:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
there are other religiously mandated
 
04:24:46.750 --> 04:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
activities that are exposed to taxation
 
04:24:46.760 --> 04:24:50.070 align:start position:0%
activities that are exposed to taxation
I

04:24:50.070 --> 04:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.830 --> 04:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
believe do you have a followup no thank
 
04:24:55.349 --> 04:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
you okay represent Al
 
04:24:59.910 --> 04:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
me thank you I also find it hard to know
 
04:25:03.910 --> 04:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
where to begin first um I was reading
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
through this um immigrant rights Network
 
04:25:11.349 --> 04:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
that we got the other day uh and I was
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
reading through it as you were listing a
 
04:25:15.710 --> 04:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of stuff that doesn't seem
 
04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
to be in here and
 
04:25:23.950 --> 04:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
about for 75% of of these are not
 
04:25:26.590 --> 04:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
organizations they are
 
04:25:29.429 --> 04:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
individuals I know a few of those
 
04:25:33.389 --> 04:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
individuals not many because they don't
 
04:25:34.990 --> 04:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
seem to have come to Western New
 
04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire very often
 
04:25:44.630 --> 04:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and the bill is full of things like
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
like um attempting to engage in in tting
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
to tending to provide intending to
 
04:25:57.790 --> 04:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
provide uh should be known uh that are
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
things that is go are going to be very
 
04:26:03.389 --> 04:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
hard to prove if you're trying to say if
 
04:26:07.750 --> 04:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
if you've got a a bounty hunter who it
 
04:26:14.030 --> 04:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
which is also a trigger term uh that are
 
04:26:19.030 --> 04:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh are is going after anybody that he
 
04:26:21.670 --> 04:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
can find that he thinks has been talking
 
04:26:24.189 --> 04:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
with somebody that that he should know
 
04:26:27.109 --> 04:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
is an illegal immigrant do not believe
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
that anything might Bill criminalizes
 
04:26:31.149 --> 04:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
speaking to an illegal
 
04:26:36.030 --> 04:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
immigrant what it does is to tax tax the
 
04:26:38.109 --> 04:26:38.119 align:start position:0%
organization that they belong to if they
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
belong to an organization I don't know
 
04:26:43.309 --> 04:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
what it does if they don't uh
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh but and then on top of that could I
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
ask you why you think that the
 
04:26:59.670 --> 04:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:27:01.840 --> 04:27:03.710 align:start position:0%
would be
capable

04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
capable
 
04:27:07.189 --> 04:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
of running a bunch of B bounty
 
04:27:10.109 --> 04:27:10.119 align:start position:0%
hunters um I believe that I said that
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
this uh gives them the authority to do
 
04:27:14.109 --> 04:27:14.119 align:start position:0%
that if they want to and there is no
 
04:27:15.750 --> 04:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that they do
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
so it's the Department of Revenue
 
04:27:24.229 --> 04:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
Administration does not have the
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
capacity or duty to do these things
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
unless you put it there and we vote for
 
04:27:35.309 --> 04:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
it I'm happy to answer any
 
04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions yes
 
04:27:37.760 --> 04:27:39.870 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions yes
represent

04:27:39.870 --> 04:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:27:45.670 --> 04:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
you talk about taking away nonprofit
 
04:27:51.990 --> 04:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
status from people who are providing
 
04:27:55.229 --> 04:27:55.239 align:start position:0%
services to people who are here
 
04:27:58.510 --> 04:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
illegally that's correct yes I'm
 
04:28:01.269 --> 04:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
wondering if you would have the same
 
04:28:02.990 --> 04:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
perspective of
 
04:28:05.550 --> 04:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
organizations that refuse to provide
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
services to people who are here legally
 
04:28:12.189 --> 04:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
who may be brown skinned or black
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
skinned or yellow
 
04:28:18.109 --> 04:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
skinned but whoever the provider may be
 
04:28:20.109 --> 04:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
might say well I don't think you're here
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
legally and because that person doesn't
 
04:28:25.550 --> 04:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
happen to have papers with him or her
 
04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
that they would simply refuse to provide
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
services respectfully there's nothing in
 
04:28:31.950 --> 04:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
this bill that mentions or alludes to
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
skin color um if an illegal immigrant uh
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
from Iceland is here it would
 
04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
criminalize that and if a uh legal
 
04:28:42.910 --> 04:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
citizen has you know my best friends
 
04:28:44.710 --> 04:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
Fred is from Nigeria now he's an
 
04:28:46.830 --> 04:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
American citizen but if he wasn't you
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
know uh so as an American citizen it is
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
and should be perfectly legal to provide
 
04:28:54.670 --> 04:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
him services so I I would strongly
 
04:28:57.309 --> 04:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
reject uh the the sort of imputation
 
04:28:58.950 --> 04:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
that there is something racist uh in
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
this bill my apologies may I revise that
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
question sure if anyone from any country
 
04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
of any color skin who was here legally
 
04:29:12.229 --> 04:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
and happened not to have papers with
 
04:29:14.910 --> 04:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
them proving that went to get services
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
and was turned down because the provider
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
organization said I don't believe you
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
are here legally would you likewise say
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
that organization needs to have its
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit status
 
04:29:32.030 --> 04:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
removed um I I think I'm being asked
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
about a question of if a different Bill
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
were proposed what would I think of that
 
04:29:37.950 --> 04:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh I have not read the text of that
 
04:29:40.590 --> 04:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
bill and I don't have an opinion on it
 
04:29:42.750 --> 04:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
um but again uh I I want to call out
 
04:29:44.750 --> 04:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
that the way you phrased the question
 
04:29:47.109 --> 04:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
was if they did not have papers on them
 
04:29:49.309 --> 04:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh nothing in here is saying that anyone
 
04:29:51.790 --> 04:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
needs to check papers uh there is a
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
federal e verify program every
 
04:29:56.229 --> 04:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
for-profit corporation and there are two
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
kinds of Corporations there are
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
for-profit corporations and there are
 
04:30:01.710 --> 04:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofit corporations um I've run you
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
know several small uh for-profit
 
04:30:06.030 --> 04:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
corporations and we have to go through
 
04:30:08.189 --> 04:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
paperwork that takes a few seconds punch
 
04:30:10.189 --> 04:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
in some data hear from the government
 
04:30:11.710 --> 04:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
that yes they're here legally they can
 
04:30:11.720 --> 04:30:12.550 align:start position:0%
that yes they're here legally they can
work

04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
um and so this is not putting any extra
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
burden on NOS uh it is merely saying
 
04:30:19.630 --> 04:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
please take the same three seconds that
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.229 --> 04:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
takes everyone else is done I have
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
another question thank you represent B
 
04:30:30.990 --> 04:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
my question so uh I have two friends
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
from uh South Africa can you tell me
 
04:30:38.590 --> 04:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
what color they are I have no
 
04:30:41.389 --> 04:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
idea do you know that Elon Musk is from
 
04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
South Africa I
 
04:30:47.990 --> 04:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
do follow up so how many illegal aliens
 
04:30:50.349 --> 04:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants or whatever they are
 
04:30:52.109 --> 04:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
whatever the term analogy is I I don't
 
04:30:53.950 --> 04:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
know anymore I'm confused just by this
 
04:30:55.630 --> 04:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
conversation how many have been
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
resettled here in the conquered General
 
04:31:00.429 --> 04:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire area whatever the specific
 
04:31:02.990 --> 04:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
question is how many illegals and I do
 
04:31:05.550 --> 04:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
not know um and part of the answer is we
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
have these NOS who are tasked with
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
providing Services uh they get paid per
 
04:31:13.229 --> 04:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
person um but because no one is asking
 
04:31:15.389 --> 04:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
them to collect this data and no one is
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
asking them to even run ever verify you
 
04:31:19.510 --> 04:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if there are three or
 
04:31:21.510 --> 04:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know 30,000 and that's part of the
 
04:31:24.630 --> 04:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
problem last follow what you know if the
 
04:31:26.710 --> 04:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
Brazilian murderer that was picked up on
 
04:31:30.109 --> 04:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast was illegal legal had
 
04:31:32.590 --> 04:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
papers I I do not know and I also don't
 
04:31:34.349 --> 04:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
know what degree of services he was
 
04:31:36.990 --> 04:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
provided by any of the NGS uh affected
 
04:31:42.109 --> 04:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
by this thank you representative spar
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with the immigration
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
nationality act I've heard the name but
 
04:31:49.070 --> 04:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer so I'll defer to your
 
04:31:50.910 --> 04:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
characterization of it it it prohibits
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
individuals from concealing shielding or
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
harboring un unauthorized individuals
 
04:31:57.550 --> 04:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
who come into and remain in the United
 
04:31:59.790 --> 04:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
States under the law it's a criminal
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
offense punishable by a fine or
 
04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
imprisonment for any person so there are
 
04:32:06.630 --> 04:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
mechanisms and there's enforcement or
 
04:32:08.670 --> 04:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms for the enforcement of
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants um do feel that your
 
04:32:15.229 --> 04:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
bill is uh unnecessary and that that no
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
I do not because again this bill is not
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
about directing the New Hampshire State
 
04:32:21.990 --> 04:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
Police to find illegals it is not about
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh communicating with ice and helping to
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
deport them this is a bill that has to
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
do with the administration of the State
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire specifically their tax
 
04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
code uh uh I don't have the RSA in front
 
04:32:36.790 --> 04:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
of me anymore but we have very carefully
 
04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
structured our uh tax code so that you
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
achieve nonprofit status you know again
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
there are corporations and corporations
 
04:32:45.550 --> 04:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
do a lot of stuff some corporations
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
provide food and they're called Catholic
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
Charities other corporations provide
 
04:32:50.830 --> 04:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
food and they're called horts we've
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
decided to privilege one of these forms
 
04:32:54.309 --> 04:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
of Corporations if they engage in
 
04:32:56.670 --> 04:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
certain pro-social acts as determined by
 
04:32:58.790 --> 04:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire government and uh this
 
04:33:00.990 --> 04:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
bill is just about thinking about what
 
04:33:02.630 --> 04:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
we actually consider pro-social and what
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
we don't the F uh these corporations
 
04:33:08.830 --> 04:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
that do the e verifi that's to hire
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
correct uh people right yes are you
 
04:33:12.910 --> 04:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
saying these nonprofits like as you
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Haner versus a Catholic
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
organization they're hiring people to
 
04:33:19.390 --> 04:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
give them food no I'm not uh I mean
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
obviously they do but I don't think
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's the point of your question um
 
04:33:24.869 --> 04:33:24.879 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that the
 
04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
determination of legal status does not
 
04:33:29.349 --> 04:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
require spinning up any additional
 
04:33:31.230 --> 04:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that infrastructure is
 
04:33:32.750 --> 04:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
already in place it's provided by the
 
04:33:34.510 --> 04:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
federal government it's free and it
 
04:33:36.750 --> 04:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
takes 3 to five
 
04:33:40.029 --> 04:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
seconds to hire someone correct no to
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
verify their status to be legally Pres
 
04:33:43.590 --> 04:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
in the United States which is used for
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
purposes uh
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
Roser thank you Mr chairman toward the
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
end of your presentation you mentioned
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
some uh cases where people who were here
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
illegally had committed some crimes some
 
04:34:05.230 --> 04:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
of them pretty
 
04:34:07.750 --> 04:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
horrific every bit of research that I
 
04:34:07.760 --> 04:34:08.670 align:start position:0%
horrific every bit of research that I
have

04:34:08.670 --> 04:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
found indicates that immigrants committ
 
04:34:13.709 --> 04:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
commit crimes at significantly lower
 
04:34:16.590 --> 04:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
rates as a group not talking about the
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
individuals that all of us get up in
 
04:34:19.039 --> 04:34:21.869 align:start position:0%
individuals that all of us get up in
arms

04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:21.879 --> 04:34:24.629 align:start position:0%
 
about

04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:34:28.830 --> 04:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
yet I'm wondering based on that should
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
we be saying that anybody who commits
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
crimes should that be a metric for
 
04:34:33.840 --> 04:34:34.910 align:start position:0%
crimes should that be a metric for
refusing

04:34:34.910 --> 04:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
refusing
 
04:34:37.390 --> 04:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
Services uh let me first start out by
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
questioning the premise uh you said that
 
04:34:41.230 --> 04:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
you uh that every study that you've
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
looked at says that immigrants uh commit
 
04:34:45.629 --> 04:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
crimes at lower than the standard rate
 
04:34:47.230 --> 04:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
I'm also familiar with that claim I have
 
04:34:50.109 --> 04:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
engaged in extensively with one
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
researcher from the KO Institute named
 
04:34:54.869 --> 04:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
Alex nashta uh Alex has written several
 
04:34:56.910 --> 04:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
white papers about how immigrants are
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know so much not just as uh Good As
 
04:35:01.070 --> 04:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
Americans on various metrics but so much
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
better and one of his claims was exactly
 
04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
that that they've committed uh far less
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
crimes far fewer crimes um but I dug
 
04:35:11.709 --> 04:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
into uh the footnotes here and um I
 
04:35:12.990 --> 04:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
tracked down where he was getting his
 
04:35:14.910 --> 04:35:14.920 align:start position:0%
data from and turns out that the
 
04:35:17.029 --> 04:35:17.039 align:start position:0%
statistic that has widely been shared
 
04:35:18.429 --> 04:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
does not actually analyze what it
 
04:35:21.070 --> 04:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
purports to analyze it looks at the
 
04:35:23.310 --> 04:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
number of people who are incarcerated
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
and as we all know from recent news
 
04:35:27.150 --> 04:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
events um many times when people commit
 
04:35:30.789 --> 04:35:30.799 align:start position:0%
crimes they are given a court date um
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
and if you are given a court date and
 
04:35:34.349 --> 04:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
then disappear you will never be
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
convicted and you will never be
 
04:35:38.590 --> 04:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so uh actually it turns out
 
04:35:40.750 --> 04:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
that immigrants do commit crimes of All
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
Sorts at higher r rates than Americans
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
um it's just that you have to be careful
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
that you're not using selection bias to
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
only look at the ones who end up serving
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
prison sentences I agree with that and
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
disagree with your conclusion thank you
 
04:35:57.269 --> 04:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
represent elme thank you I'm wondering
 
04:36:00.070 --> 04:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
what data do you have to back up the
 
04:36:04.510 --> 04:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
number of illegal immigrants who commit
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
crimes um I do not have this they have
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
data but of a subset which is something
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
you are using before right uh they
 
04:36:18.269 --> 04:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
um I've never heard of a survey that
 
04:36:21.789 --> 04:36:21.799 align:start position:0%
managed to get to all of the people who
 
04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
had had were in the United States as
 
04:36:30.029 --> 04:36:30.039 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants and not yet uh given
 
04:36:34.670 --> 04:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
Asylum dates and things like that um
 
04:36:39.551 --> 04:36:39.561 align:start position:0%
who were um uh were committing
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
crimes I'm sorry I didn't quite proce CE
 
04:36:45.310 --> 04:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
the question what what is your your data
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
source right um this investigation is
 
04:36:50.349 --> 04:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
something that I dug into a year or two
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
ago I don't have that on hand but uh
 
04:36:55.310 --> 04:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
again the focus of this bill is not
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
coordinating with ice it's not deporting
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
people it's not saying that illegal
 
04:37:02.429 --> 04:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
immigrants uh commit crimes this bill is
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
about what types of Corporations the
 
04:37:06.551 --> 04:37:06.561 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire chooses uh to
 
04:37:09.629 --> 04:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
extend nonprofit status
 
04:37:12.789 --> 04:37:12.799 align:start position:0%
to representative duet
 
04:37:15.269 --> 04:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
just to that question I just heard by
 
04:37:18.551 --> 04:37:18.561 align:start position:0%
virtue of them being illegal
 
04:37:22.109 --> 04:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
immigrants Crossing into this country
 
04:37:24.150 --> 04:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
illegally by
 
04:37:27.990 --> 04:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
definition would that not mean that 100%
 
04:37:30.269 --> 04:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
of the illegal immigrants are law
 
04:37:32.070 --> 04:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
Breakers I agree with you so the answer
 
04:37:32.080 --> 04:37:34.470 align:start position:0%
Breakers I agree with you so the answer
is

04:37:34.470 --> 04:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
yes okay um seeing no more questions
 
04:37:43.830 --> 04:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:45.629 --> 04:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
just to let the committee know I've got
 
04:37:48.070 --> 04:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh 10 10 pink cards so 10 10 people who
 
04:37:50.349 --> 04:37:50.359 align:start position:0%
want to speak
 
04:37:53.470 --> 04:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
um so next I
 
04:37:56.910 --> 04:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
have we'll ask representative McFarlin
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:04.709 --> 04:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
up and uh you we're it looks like most
 
04:38:07.109 --> 04:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
people we put down fairly short amount
 
04:38:10.150 --> 04:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
of time um two you put down two minutes
 
04:38:12.230 --> 04:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chairman good
 
04:38:17.189 --> 04:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman honorable members
 
04:38:18.990 --> 04:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Donald McFarland from
 
04:38:21.150 --> 04:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
Orange I thank you for the opportunity
 
04:38:24.949 --> 04:38:24.959 align:start position:0%
to testify here on House Bill 635 this
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
testimony represents My Views and the
 
04:38:28.150 --> 04:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
views and interests of my constituents
 
04:38:30.949 --> 04:38:30.959 align:start position:0%
in graph 18 my testimony is not made on
 
04:38:32.830 --> 04:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of any private employer nor
 
04:38:34.230 --> 04:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
should it be construed to represent the
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
employers I think in in what we've just
 
04:38:42.269 --> 04:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
heard from the prime sponsor uh some of
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
those remarks were
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
specious and I am troubled by the
 
04:38:49.709 --> 04:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
language of the bill nevertheless I'm in
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
front of you to support the
 
04:38:57.390 --> 04:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
bill the intent of the bill is a is a
 
04:38:59.510 --> 04:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
solid and strong one the rationale
 
04:39:02.109 --> 04:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
behind permitting and providing tax
 
04:39:04.830 --> 04:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
benefit to nonprofit organizations at
 
04:39:06.670 --> 04:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
both the New Hampshire level at the
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
state level and under the federal laws
 
04:39:12.551 --> 04:39:12.561 align:start position:0%
with 501c3 designations and so forth is
 
04:39:15.189 --> 04:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
fundamentally to encourage charitable
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
religious educational and public service
 
04:39:20.189 --> 04:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
activities that benefit
 
04:39:22.750 --> 04:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
society and while representative
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
elberger may be asking us
 
04:39:28.990 --> 04:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions about immigrants I put it to
 
04:39:30.990 --> 04:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
you that we have to be very clear here
 
04:39:32.590 --> 04:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
this is not about immigrants this is
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
about illegal immigrants illegal aliens
 
04:39:38.430 --> 04:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
specifically as representative ery
 
04:39:40.830 --> 04:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
said I have looked at those studies that
 
04:39:42.670 --> 04:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
you reference Ed in some
 
04:39:47.230 --> 04:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
detail like uh the prior speaker I don't
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
have those facts and figures at my
 
04:39:50.830 --> 04:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
fingertips but you you may detect from
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
my accent that I have an interest in
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
this and I satisfied Myself by looking
 
04:39:58.830 --> 04:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
at those studies that there was some
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
Merit I'm not saying it was absolutely
 
04:40:03.750 --> 04:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
clear lies damn lies and statistics
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
right but but it seemed to be the case
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
that in fact immigrants are incarcerated
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
at a lower rate and do commit uh
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
violations of law at a lower rate than
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of of the US citizenry that is
 
04:40:21.628 --> 04:40:21.638 align:start position:0%
not true when it comes to illegal aliens
 
04:40:24.510 --> 04:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
not only have they as was stated
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
committed a violation of law in Crossing
 
04:40:30.628 --> 04:40:30.638 align:start position:0%
into the country in many
 
04:40:35.350 --> 04:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
cases but in in the aggregate they are
 
04:40:39.628 --> 04:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
more prone to causing societal
 
04:40:42.990 --> 04:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
problems it is not a benefit to New
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to encourage and support the
 
04:40:50.070 --> 04:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
presence of illegal aliens here in New
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for us to say and let's be
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
narrow about this for us to say in this
 
04:40:58.590 --> 04:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
bill if we can get the language right we
 
04:41:01.628 --> 04:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
do not think that we should
 
04:41:04.830 --> 04:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
be benefiting an organization that we
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
should be supporting an organization
 
04:41:08.830 --> 04:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
with these nonprofit designations and
 
04:41:08.840 --> 04:41:09.670 align:start position:0%
with these nonprofit designations and
tax

04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
benefits that is AC against the
 
04:41:13.868 --> 04:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
interests of our society I think that is
 
04:41:15.150 --> 04:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
something that is appropriate for the
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
state legislature to do there was a
 
04:41:18.990 --> 04:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
question I think it was rep bar that
 
04:41:23.070 --> 04:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
asked about do we have satisfactory
 
04:41:25.390 --> 04:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
legislation at the federal level and yes
 
04:41:27.910 --> 04:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
we indeed have a bunch of federal
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
statutes I would cite at8 USC
 
04:41:33.750 --> 04:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
1324 which makes it a felony to Aid and
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
abet these illegal
 
04:41:39.070 --> 04:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
aliens that applies to their
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
employers that applies to to people
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
giving them sanctuary in other
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
respects is that federal statute
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient it certainly hasn't been over
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
the last number of years maybe it will
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
start to be employed a little bit more
 
04:41:55.670 --> 04:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
under the new
 
04:41:57.990 --> 04:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
Administration but when we ask ourselves
 
04:41:59.390 --> 04:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
what should we be doing as a state
 
04:42:01.150 --> 04:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
legislature and what can we do as a
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
state legislature I think that even
 
04:42:06.270 --> 04:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
though his language may not be perfect
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
representative corran's idea is a strong
 
04:42:10.628 --> 04:42:10.638 align:start position:0%
one and I would strongly encourage this
 
04:42:13.470 --> 04:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
committee to contemplate whatever
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
amendments might be needed so that you
 
04:42:17.948 --> 04:42:17.958 align:start position:0%
can support this bill and move it ought
 
04:42:19.868 --> 04:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
to pass uh thank you and I Y to
 
04:42:22.310 --> 04:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:42:25.470 --> 04:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
YY thank you representative I enjoy
 
04:42:27.150 --> 04:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
listening to you as you know we've had
 
04:42:30.270 --> 04:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
that discussion
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh would in your opinion would this uh
 
04:42:37.470 --> 04:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
if we modify the language to upon
 
04:42:41.670 --> 04:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
conviction of or by
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
somebody would that be a more effective
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
and judicious application of this
 
04:42:47.400 --> 04:42:49.030 align:start position:0%
and judicious application of this
particular

04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:42:52.310 --> 04:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
penalty I I think in answering that let
 
04:42:54.670 --> 04:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
let me say this I first of all I think
 
04:42:57.150 --> 04:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
it's absurd to say that one of these
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
organizations could use eify eify is not
 
04:43:02.470 --> 04:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
designed to assess who is here legally
 
04:43:04.788 --> 04:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's designed to assess who is able
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
lawfully to work and those are two
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
different issues we've also heard in
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
other committees that he verifi I has
 
04:43:14.590 --> 04:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
some operational difficulties such that
 
04:43:17.430 --> 04:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
I believe the labor committee voted itl
 
04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
on a bill to require e verify for all
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
employers so I think to your
 
04:43:28.590 --> 04:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
question it is difficult to come up and
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
I I believe you said this yourself it is
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
difficult to come up with some of the
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for enforcement it is
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
difficult to come up with some of the
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
mechanisms whereby the Charities uh and
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
the organizations themselves would be
 
04:43:43.948 --> 04:43:43.958 align:start position:0%
able to make the these discernments on
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
an individual caseby casee basis I would
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
say to you first of all that I think
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
that your suggestion is an interesting
 
04:43:52.350 --> 04:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
one that I might well support I would
 
04:43:54.510 --> 04:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
also say to you that there is a
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
difference between picking out one
 
04:44:00.948 --> 04:44:00.958 align:start position:0%
individual exception to the rule as a
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
basis to deny nonprofit status and
 
04:44:07.750 --> 04:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the prevailing circumstances
 
04:44:10.628 --> 04:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
and and seeing what is uh no longer just
 
04:44:12.270 --> 04:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
the AUD exception here or there where
 
04:44:13.310 --> 04:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't come with their
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
paperwork and what has turned into a
 
04:44:19.470 --> 04:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
routine and major part of that
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
organization's business and we know that
 
04:44:24.310 --> 04:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
in this state there are multiple
 
04:44:27.430 --> 04:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
organizations that are routinely and and
 
04:44:29.990 --> 04:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
as a very significant part of their
 
04:44:34.590 --> 04:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
activities focusing on individuals who I
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
I don't dislike this language where it
 
04:44:37.948 --> 04:44:37.958 align:start position:0%
says should know rather than merely
 
04:44:40.868 --> 04:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
knowingly who should very well know that
 
04:44:44.430 --> 04:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
they are focused on illegal
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
aliens other
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
DWI hi I'm Nathan DWI I'm a citizen of
 
04:45:16.708 --> 04:45:16.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I I live at uh 211 Valley
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
West way in
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh hillsbor County and I'm
 
04:45:24.910 --> 04:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
here to speak on behalf of Bill 6 uh
 
04:45:28.830 --> 04:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
35 um I don't have huge amount to say on
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
this I'm just
 
04:45:35.030 --> 04:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat an I think Paul is a little
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's too strong but it's the word that
 
04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
comes to mind that we are currently
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
spending money
 
04:45:43.868 --> 04:45:43.878 align:start position:0%
to help
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
out uh we are
 
04:45:45.840 --> 04:45:47.430 align:start position:0%
out uh we are
currently

04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:45:49.670 --> 04:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
through uh new hampire where're spending
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
money and giving that money to uh
 
04:45:55.750 --> 04:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofits who then use that money to
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
facilitate illegal immigration when we
 
04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
still have problems for example paying
 
04:46:04.030 --> 04:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
for schools we have and a variety of
 
04:46:05.750 --> 04:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
other problems I'd prefer that money be
 
04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
spent in new Hamp uh for New Hampshire
 
04:46:10.990 --> 04:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
citizens and for people who who legally
 
04:46:14.590 --> 04:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
live here uh you my time or questions
 
04:46:17.070 --> 04:46:17.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions seeing none
 
04:46:17.080 --> 04:46:21.590 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions seeing none
thank

04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:30.708 --> 04:46:30.718 align:start position:0%

Valentini hi my name is Justin Valentini
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
I live at 82 School Street right here in
 
04:46:39.548 --> 04:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
conquer ladies and Gentlemen We Gather
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
here today to support House Bill 635 a
 
04:46:44.868 --> 04:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
bill that reflects our commitment to
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
dignity and fairness for all in our
 
04:46:50.350 --> 04:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
modern era it is not just unacceptable
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
but morally repugnant to continue
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
practices that Echo the darkest parts of
 
04:46:58.470 --> 04:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
our history bringing poor illegal aliens
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
to our state solely for the purpose of
 
04:47:04.230 --> 04:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
Labor is nothing short of modern-day
 
04:47:06.910 --> 04:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
slavery just as slaveholders 200 years
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
ago exploited human beings for economic
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
gain we must recognize that using
 
04:47:15.230 --> 04:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
immigration policy to fill labor
 
04:47:18.510 --> 04:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
shortages is a continuation of that same
 
04:47:18.520 --> 04:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
shortages is a continuation of that same
dehumanizing

04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
dehumanizing
 
04:47:24.030 --> 04:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
Legacy House Bill 635 is not about not
 
04:47:26.430 --> 04:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
just about policy it is about restoring
 
04:47:29.868 --> 04:47:29.878 align:start position:0%
integrity and Humanity to our
 
04:47:31.868 --> 04:47:31.878 align:start position:0%
system let's talk about the
 
04:47:33.948 --> 04:47:33.958 align:start position:0%
organizations that profit from this
 
04:47:35.190 --> 04:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
cycle of
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
exploitation the NOS that claim to
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
support the resettlement of these
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
individuals it is crucial to examine who
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
benefits from this system the leadership
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
in these organizations is predominantly
 
04:47:49.230 --> 04:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
white and there's a clear Financial
 
04:47:52.030 --> 04:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
incentive at play they are not driven by
 
04:47:54.990 --> 04:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
altruism but by profit capitalizing on
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
the plight of the vulnerable to secure
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
funds and
 
04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
influence we must ask ourselves why are
 
04:48:04.350 --> 04:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
these jobs not filled by those who
 
04:48:07.510 --> 04:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
advocate for this system the answer is
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
starkly clear these are jobs they
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
themselves would never
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
do House Bill 635 aims to stop the
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funding of this structure of
 
04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
human trafficking and profit
 
04:48:23.868 --> 04:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
hearing supporting this bill means that
 
04:48:25.430 --> 04:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
we are committed to breaking the chains
 
04:48:28.350 --> 04:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
of exploitation that have been reformed
 
04:48:29.310 --> 04:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
but not
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
eradicated this bill is just the first
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
step to stopping the flow it's about
 
04:48:37.470 --> 04:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
rethinking our approach to labor dignity
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
and human rights by passing this bill we
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
take a stand against practices that are
 
04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
reminiscent of our past we affirm that
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
every person regardless of origin
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
deserves to live free from
 
04:48:53.070 --> 04:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
exploitation let us choose a future
 
04:48:55.150 --> 04:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
where our actions reflect our values of
 
04:48:58.788 --> 04:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
equality respect and opportunity for all
 
04:48:58.798 --> 04:48:59.470 align:start position:0%
equality respect and opportunity for all

04:49:30.030 --> 04:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
are not there because they believe in
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
what they're doing it sounded like you
 
04:49:33.070 --> 04:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
were saying that at the beginning of
 
04:49:35.548 --> 04:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
your testimony I believe they have a
 
04:49:37.390 --> 04:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
financial incentive that creates a
 
04:49:41.670 --> 04:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:41.680 --> 04:49:42.990 align:start position:0%
 
represent

04:49:42.990 --> 04:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:49:47.350 --> 04:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
elme do you have any information that
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
indicates that any of these people are
 
04:49:54.470 --> 04:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
benefiting uh
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
illegally by a fin this financial
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
incentive you're talking
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
about benefiting illegally no I have
 
04:50:08.948 --> 04:50:08.958 align:start position:0%
benefiting from uh from bringing in
 
04:50:11.708 --> 04:50:11.718 align:start position:0%
immigrants and
 
04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh helping them to find jobs do they
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
have any Financial relationship with uh
 
04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
the companies that they are or Farms
 
04:50:25.830 --> 04:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
that they are getting uh jobs
 
04:50:28.470 --> 04:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
from not entirely sure I understand the
 
04:50:31.390 --> 04:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
question but I will say that they have
 
04:50:33.948 --> 04:50:33.958 align:start position:0%
an incentive in so far as they are paid
 
04:50:38.590 --> 04:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
through salaries and they have I mean if
 
04:50:40.628 --> 04:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
you just think about it right if you are
 
04:50:42.230 --> 04:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
are an organization that wants to
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
resettle people here you have every
 
04:50:47.510 --> 04:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
incentive to want to resettle more and
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
more people right there there like
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
there's no like their job is done once
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
they hit some certain cap so they will
 
04:51:01.788 --> 04:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:06.350 --> 04:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
grow okay uh yes who's paying those
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
organizations some cases they are
 
04:51:12.070 --> 04:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funded okay and other
 
04:51:17.590 --> 04:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
sure okay seeing no more questions thank
 
04:51:22.708 --> 04:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.230 --> 04:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:34.670 --> 04:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
Dre hey good afternoon my name's John
 
04:51:37.390 --> 04:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
dman uh I'm a longtime resident of uh
 
04:51:39.868 --> 04:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I uh my family and I
 
04:51:43.910 --> 04:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
currently reside in pum and uh I'm up
 
04:51:46.110 --> 04:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
here today because I am also a strong
 
04:51:48.430 --> 04:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
supporter of HP
 
04:51:48.440 --> 04:51:50.150 align:start position:0%
supporter of HP
365

04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
365
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
and uh I want to say that uh I think
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
after I thought I knew what we were
 
04:51:57.948 --> 04:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about when I came in
 
04:52:01.830 --> 04:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
here this this afternoon uh in my mind
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about individuals
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about policy at the
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
federal government level I think what
 
04:52:11.110 --> 04:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is the tax status of
 
04:52:13.030 --> 04:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
companies doing business in the state of
 
04:52:17.070 --> 04:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and specifically Nos and
 
04:52:19.030 --> 04:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
whether they should retain a tax exemp
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
status or not and many of us here today
 
04:52:23.150 --> 04:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
are going to tell you we don't think
 
04:52:23.160 --> 04:52:23.788 align:start position:0%
are going to tell you we don't think
they

04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:52:26.750 --> 04:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
should uh I would also tell you and just
 
04:52:29.310 --> 04:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
listening to everyone this afternoon we
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
really have no transparency in the state
 
04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire over this topic for
 
04:52:39.868 --> 04:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
example uh how is this program managed
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
who's in who's in charge how many people
 
04:52:45.470 --> 04:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
fall into this program through the NGO
 
04:52:47.788 --> 04:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
organizations come to New
 
04:52:49.868 --> 04:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who's making all those
 
04:52:52.310 --> 04:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
decisions what's the purpose of the
 
04:52:52.320 --> 04:52:53.430 align:start position:0%
decisions what's the purpose of the
refugee

04:52:53.430 --> 04:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
refugee
 
04:52:56.510 --> 04:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh uh division under the
 
04:52:59.310 --> 04:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
governor what do they do I would tell
 
04:53:02.030 --> 04:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
you in my brief look at all this what
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
they do is they serve as nothing more
 
04:53:06.430 --> 04:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
than a facilitator between the
 
04:53:09.310 --> 04:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
Department of State and NOS that are
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
doing business here in New Hampshire so
 
04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh foreign
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
resettlement is Big Business and uh a
 
04:53:22.070 --> 04:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
lot of you a lot of us have talked about
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
what are we call what are we calling
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
this I've heard everything from illegal
 
04:53:29.310 --> 04:53:29.320 align:start position:0%
aliens uh undocumented
 
04:53:33.070 --> 04:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
immigrants uh and every variation of
 
04:53:35.310 --> 04:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
that theme I think what we're talking
 
04:53:37.510 --> 04:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
about the correct term is and like a lot
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
of people don't like to talk about it is
 
04:53:41.150 --> 04:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
it's illegal aliens that's the correct
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
term that gets you to the level of
 
04:53:45.390 --> 04:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
fidelity you need but we're not talking
 
04:53:47.310 --> 04:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
about the individual we're talking about
 
04:53:47.320 --> 04:53:48.470 align:start position:0%
about the individual we're talking about
the

04:53:48.470 --> 04:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:53:52.230 --> 04:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
corporation uh so this is a uh the
 
04:53:55.350 --> 04:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
business model here is you get paid I
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
Believe by the uh the ngos get paid for
 
04:53:59.788 --> 04:53:59.798 align:start position:0%
each individual they bring through the
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
system the more individuals you bring
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
the more you get paid how much is that I
 
04:54:07.150 --> 04:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
have no idea I don't know if any of you
 
04:54:10.390 --> 04:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
know how much that money is each year
 
04:54:12.868 --> 04:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
but I think it's worth taking a look at
 
04:54:16.190 --> 04:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh long-term cost we're talking really
 
04:54:20.070 --> 04:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
about uh the tax status but there's also
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
long-term cost to the state of New
 
04:54:26.110 --> 04:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the uh the NOS are in what I
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
call phase one 60 to 90 days and after
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people that are in this
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
program shift over to uh uh various uh
 
04:54:40.510 --> 04:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh social welfare programs for the long
 
04:54:44.150 --> 04:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
term and they become invisible to us uh
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
so I believe that these NGO
 
04:54:48.628 --> 04:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
organizations do operate as a business
 
04:54:51.310 --> 04:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
in the area that we're talking about and
 
04:54:54.830 --> 04:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
so I strongly support the bill and I
 
04:54:57.788 --> 04:54:57.798 align:start position:0%
think this bill is really just phase one
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
I think this bill would go a long way to
 
04:55:02.670 --> 04:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
making the program visible to the people
 
04:55:05.708 --> 04:55:05.718 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and to you so we can
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
have a common view of the battlefield
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
here so when we're talking about this
 
04:55:13.708 --> 04:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
program what's the size and scope of
 
04:55:17.030 --> 04:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
this program I don't know I'm not sure
 
04:55:19.708 --> 04:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
any of you know uh and I just say that
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
because that's kind of how it is but
 
04:55:24.030 --> 04:55:24.040 align:start position:0%
from a tax status I think we're talking
 
04:55:27.150 --> 04:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of money I see no reason why these
 
04:55:29.350 --> 04:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
individual organizations shouldn't pay
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
their fair share to use an overuse term
 
04:55:37.990 --> 04:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes to uh taxable status so
 
04:55:39.990 --> 04:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much and I'll take your
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
question questions if you have any
 
04:55:45.150 --> 04:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
representa elmy thank you I am very
 
04:55:48.390 --> 04:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
confused it sounds like you're talking
 
04:55:52.470 --> 04:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
about the legal immigration that the
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
federal government has been paying for
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
to place people
 
04:56:00.548 --> 04:56:00.558 align:start position:0%
into uh Manchester in particular but a
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
number of different places well we're
 
04:56:04.470 --> 04:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the in New Hampshire
 
04:56:07.310 --> 04:56:07.320 align:start position:0%
you're talking about some hidden single
 
04:56:12.548 --> 04:56:12.558 align:start position:0%
program of NOS no I'm I'm not talking
 
04:56:15.948 --> 04:56:15.958 align:start position:0%

life I have a
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
question we have a budget deficit here
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:57:13.150 --> 04:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
I'm from salsburg New Hampshire just up
 
04:57:13.160 --> 04:57:13.868 align:start position:0%
I'm from salsburg New Hampshire just up

04:57:13.868 --> 04:57:13.878 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:16.350 --> 04:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
road our school right now is proposing a
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
warrant article for $2 million to fill a
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
budget deficit why are these
 
04:57:24.990 --> 04:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
organizations tax exempt they're clearly
 
04:57:26.910 --> 04:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
profitable the people that work for them
 
04:57:29.150 --> 04:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
clearly are making plenty of money the
 
04:57:31.708 --> 04:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
incentives are all
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
there everybody's I was just at my uh
 
04:57:38.430 --> 04:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
Town's uh budget hearing yesterday
 
04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
everybody's complaining about taxes
 
04:57:43.548 --> 04:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
local taxes Rising mostly because of the
 
04:57:45.070 --> 04:57:45.080 align:start position:0%
load of additional people coming into
 
04:57:47.628 --> 04:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
communities why are we supporting more
 
04:57:49.948 --> 04:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
people more immigration illegal
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
immigration into the state of New
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where our property values have
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
jumped 70% in the past 5 years where our
 
04:58:00.750 --> 04:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
population you jumped 200,000 in the
 
04:58:02.150 --> 04:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
past five
 
04:58:04.750 --> 04:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
years and we're supporting this somehow
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
where our seniors can't pay their house
 
04:58:09.230 --> 04:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
taxes and they might get kicked out of
 
04:58:13.110 --> 04:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
this and we're allocating money and
 
04:58:17.030 --> 04:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're basically taking money off the
 
04:58:18.830 --> 04:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
table for these organizations to do
 
04:58:20.910 --> 04:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
whatever they will with that money and
 
04:58:22.070 --> 04:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
yet there's a budget deficit in the
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
state budget what's going on thank
 
04:58:35.190 --> 04:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Tyler Richardson
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
longtime president of New Hampshire I'm
 
04:58:55.070 --> 04:58:55.080 align:start position:0%
just here to support the bill and say I
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
don't think we should be incentivizing
 
04:58:59.948 --> 04:58:59.958 align:start position:0%
this kind of behavior with companies in
 
04:59:03.390 --> 04:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
our state um previous speaker that was
 
04:59:06.230 --> 04:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
excellent um you know we shouldn't be
 
04:59:08.030 --> 04:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
incentivizing bringing people here and
 
04:59:10.830 --> 04:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
taking up more of our social services
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
and state fund State funding when we
 
04:59:15.310 --> 04:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
don't have enough to go around as it
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
04:59:22.990 --> 04:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:26.070 --> 04:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
much next I have
 
04:59:26.080 --> 04:59:32.948 align:start position:0%
much next I have
Matt

04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
L afternoon uh my name is Matt leair I
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
live in stratum and I just want to say
 
04:59:41.830 --> 04:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
I'm against tax exempt status for
 
04:59:44.190 --> 04:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
corporations that are involved in human
 
04:59:45.548 --> 04:59:45.558 align:start position:0%
trafficking because that's really what
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
this is that's all I have to say okay
 
04:59:55.390 --> 04:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:08.350 --> 05:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
Kaufman hi I'm Jeremy Kaufman I'm a
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
resident of East Manchester where I've
 
05:00:13.230 --> 05:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
lived for more than a decade uh I
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
believe this area of the city has
 
05:00:16.948 --> 05:00:16.958 align:start position:0%
received more of these types of migrants
 
05:00:18.990 --> 05:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
and Asylum Seekers than any other part
 
05:00:21.868 --> 05:00:21.878 align:start position:0%
of the State uh to my knowledge several
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
thousand of these people have been
 
05:00:25.948 --> 05:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
settled in in Manchester making up a a
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
substantial percentage of the population
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
now at least several digit percentage
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these people are in East
 
05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester specifically and so I'm not
 
05:00:35.868 --> 05:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
going to argue statistics uh or facts
 
05:00:37.390 --> 05:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you a little bit about
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
the subjective experience of living in a
 
05:00:41.548 --> 05:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
place where some of these people are are
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
coming um and it absolutely does change
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
the character of the city uh in a way
 
05:00:50.948 --> 05:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
for the worst um and I'll tell one short
 
05:00:53.350 --> 05:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
story although I could tell a bunch um
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
we uh I do these park cleanups with a
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
group called weart West in in Manchester
 
05:00:59.708 --> 05:00:59.718 align:start position:0%
we go around we we uh we clean up the
 
05:01:01.910 --> 05:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
parks and there's a park in East
 
05:01:03.830 --> 05:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester that's specifically dirty all
 
05:01:05.788 --> 05:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
the time and we went out and we cleaned
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
up we filled up about 10 bags of trash
 
05:01:11.150 --> 05:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
and the woman uh shows up with her
 
05:01:12.990 --> 05:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
children this we're mostly done with the
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
cleanup we gave her kids some some candy
 
05:01:17.948 --> 05:01:17.958 align:start position:0%
she couldn't speak English and she she
 
05:01:19.470 --> 05:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
littered the candy wrappers right in
 
05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
front of us right after we had cleaned
 
05:01:24.150 --> 05:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
up all the trash and you know that's not
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
going to show up on your crime stats I
 
05:01:27.270 --> 05:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what stats going to show up
 
05:01:29.628 --> 05:01:29.638 align:start position:0%
that number but but the idea that
 
05:01:31.510 --> 05:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere would get a tax deduction to
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
bring more people like her into East
 
05:01:36.190 --> 05:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester like what are we what are we
 
05:01:38.708 --> 05:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
doing you know so talk to some of the
 
05:01:40.310 --> 05:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
people in these parts of the City talk
 
05:01:41.590 --> 05:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
to some of the places where these people
 
05:01:43.470 --> 05:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
end up and just ask yourself is this
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
charity work is is this what we want to
 
05:01:47.670 --> 05:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
subsidize as the government and I would
 
05:01:48.990 --> 05:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
talk to some of the people who end up
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
not the NOS who are getting paid who are
 
05:01:51.868 --> 05:01:51.878 align:start position:0%
making money they can set in their
 
05:01:54.548 --> 05:01:54.558 align:start position:0%
lobbyist talk to people who who end up
 
05:01:55.708 --> 05:01:55.718 align:start position:0%
where these people end up because I'm
 
05:01:57.150 --> 05:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
here for free I don't get paid to do
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
this you know so talk to some of those
 
05:02:00.750 --> 05:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
people that's all I'd say thank you
 
05:02:11.788 --> 05:02:11.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:18.670 --> 05:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
Daves hello everyone uh my name is
 
05:02:23.150 --> 05:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
Stephen Daves I live in Deerfield I'm
 
05:02:26.670 --> 05:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
here to um to support the bill um I
 
05:02:29.948 --> 05:02:29.958 align:start position:0%
think there's a a negative incentive
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
with encouraging tax exemption for
 
05:02:34.948 --> 05:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
committing felonies uh just in general
 
05:02:36.230 --> 05:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
you probably shouldn't do that
 
05:02:37.548 --> 05:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
especially if you have an opportunity to
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
uphold the Constitution uh which which
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
talks about directly naturalization
 
05:02:42.830 --> 05:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
process you're supposed to follow if you
 
05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
want to come to this country um and not
 
05:02:48.030 --> 05:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
it does not talk about specifically
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
giving tax exempt status to bring people
 
05:02:52.590 --> 05:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
here illegally um so that's all I want
 
05:02:54.190 --> 05:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
to test give testimony for if you have
 
05:02:56.110 --> 05:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll entertain
 
05:03:05.150 --> 05:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:14.270 --> 05:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:17.230 --> 05:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
hi uh Ben hartin live with my family in
 
05:03:19.548 --> 05:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
Penbrook building in landf 've been New
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents for about four years
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
um in the decade or so after my wife and
 
05:03:25.590 --> 05:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
I met at MIT we lived in just about
 
05:03:27.310 --> 05:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
every blue City you can think of across
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
this country uh for work uh travel all
 
05:03:32.070 --> 05:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
that and when it came time for us to
 
05:03:34.030 --> 05:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
settle down and start a family we chose
 
05:03:36.030 --> 05:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for a reason it's because
 
05:03:37.750 --> 05:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
living and working in those cities we've
 
05:03:40.548 --> 05:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
seen all of the problems uh that come
 
05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
with uh you know sort of like unfettered
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
um illegal immigration breakdown of rule
 
05:03:46.990 --> 05:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
of law Etc we thought about a place that
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
we wanted to settle down and invest in
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
Raz our 2 soon to be three children New
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire made sense uh and when I look
 
05:03:57.270 --> 05:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
at us subsidizing functionally what
 
05:03:58.990 --> 05:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing with that nonprofit s
 
05:04:02.430 --> 05:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
subsidizing people to Aid and abet uh
 
05:04:04.350 --> 05:04:04.360 align:start position:0%
people who are here illegally just
 
05:04:05.868 --> 05:04:05.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to
 
05:04:07.910 --> 05:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
me thank
 
05:04:14.628 --> 05:04:14.638 align:start position:0%

in Dober and I just want to say I don't
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
support human trafficking and I don't
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
think that we should support it with our
 
05:04:33.788 --> 05:04:33.798 align:start position:0%
tax dollars or tax exempt
 
05:04:36.190 --> 05:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
statuses uh we have so many things that
 
05:04:39.110 --> 05:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
we need to pay for in this country that
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
we should not be maxing our credit cards
 
05:04:44.548 --> 05:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
to bring in illegal immigrants for
 
05:04:47.110 --> 05:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
non-exempt status that's all I have to
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%

05:05:16.110 --> 05:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
testify today but there's been so much
 
05:05:17.910 --> 05:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about Refugee
 
05:05:19.110 --> 05:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
resettlement and some of the
 
05:05:21.548 --> 05:05:21.558 align:start position:0%
organizations that work with refugees
 
05:05:23.548 --> 05:05:23.558 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to set the record
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
straight uh Refugee resettlement is a
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
federal program carefully managed by the
 
05:05:31.788 --> 05:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
US state department and the US office of
 
05:05:34.470 --> 05:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services organizations
 
05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
like mine have contracts with the state
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to assist those legal
 
05:05:43.868 --> 05:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
refugees when they're here we don't get
 
05:05:46.510 --> 05:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
paid per head but we get paid to deliver
 
05:05:50.670 --> 05:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
services and I get paid uh to run the
 
05:05:54.190 --> 05:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
organization uh I don't we are not a a
 
05:05:58.110 --> 05:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
wealthy organization by any means uh but
 
05:06:01.150 --> 05:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
it's an important and valuable service I
 
05:06:02.788 --> 05:06:02.798 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that New Hampshire is
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
better off because of refugee
 
05:06:08.350 --> 05:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
resettlement here people serve in this
 
05:06:11.590 --> 05:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislature who came as refugees uh and
 
05:06:14.430 --> 05:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
I'm proud of proud that they were among
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
the founders of my
 
05:06:20.910 --> 05:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
organization uh so it's really valuable
 
05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
to step back and recognize that the only
 
05:06:27.788 --> 05:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
people bring who in New Hampshire that
 
05:06:31.150 --> 05:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of who are importing
 
05:06:34.310 --> 05:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
foreigners under federal government uh
 
05:06:35.590 --> 05:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the form of
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
refugees uh none of the organizations
 
05:06:41.350 --> 05:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
that were list Ed in in the sponsors
 
05:06:44.110 --> 05:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
testimony is to my knowledge are
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
trafficking in human beings are bringing
 
05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
in people are being paid to bring in
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
people or get PA or paid to once they
 
05:06:55.390 --> 05:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
are here by any public
 
05:06:59.430 --> 05:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
Source I am not an expert in services to
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
people without
 
05:07:03.548 --> 05:07:03.558 align:start position:0%
documentation in fact I know very little
 
05:07:07.310 --> 05:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
about it we do check our clients
 
05:07:10.670 --> 05:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
immigration status because we do get
 
05:07:14.350 --> 05:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
paid by our federal contracts only if
 
05:07:16.510 --> 05:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
people are here in the first 5 years of
 
05:07:18.670 --> 05:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
their time in the United States with
 
05:07:18.680 --> 05:07:19.750 align:start position:0%
their time in the United States with
with

05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:07:22.470 --> 05:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
documentation and so I think most of
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
what you
 
05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
see most of what's been talking about
 
05:07:29.470 --> 05:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
here is based on misunderstandings and
 
05:07:32.350 --> 05:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
misconceptions uh there are certainly
 
05:07:34.830 --> 05:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire without
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
documentation it's a separate issue and
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know much about the Services
 
05:07:43.310 --> 05:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
they get or who provides them I imagine
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
that hospitals take care of them if they
 
05:07:48.230 --> 05:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
get hit hit by a car I imagine the
 
05:07:49.990 --> 05:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
churches feed them if they show up at
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
the food pantry and and I know that
 
05:07:53.830 --> 05:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
there are people who are trying to
 
05:07:56.110 --> 05:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
organize them and help them get
 
05:07:58.750 --> 05:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship and Asylum and and to live
 
05:08:01.310 --> 05:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
and work in the United States you can be
 
05:08:04.670 --> 05:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
the judge of whether that's prudent uh
 
05:08:06.628 --> 05:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
activity for a
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit I I that's your your
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
domain uh but I I want you to understand
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
that um it's frustrating as it is when
 
05:08:18.670 --> 05:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
somebody throws candy wrappers on the
 
05:08:22.590 --> 05:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
ground and I man I'd get pissed off too
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's not really R A rationale for
 
05:08:29.310 --> 05:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
adopting this bill I urge you to itl it
 
05:08:31.510 --> 05:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's well conceived and I
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
don't think that that the problem of
 
05:08:36.830 --> 05:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
serving uh the illegals is is a a a
 
05:08:43.708 --> 05:08:43.718 align:start position:0%
significant financial uh impact on the
 
05:08:45.868 --> 05:08:45.878 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire thank you any
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%

questions seeing none thank
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%

wishes to
 
05:08:59.600 --> 05:09:02.190 align:start position:0%
wishes to

Council for the Department of Revenue
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you representative
 
05:10:01.510 --> 05:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um in reading the bill on
 
05:10:05.110 --> 05:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
page one line 14 and 15 the use of
 
05:10:07.150 --> 05:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
Consolidated returns is defined in the
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
United States Internal Revenue code or
 
05:10:12.548 --> 05:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
in the combin combined reporting is not
 
05:10:12.558 --> 05:10:15.390 align:start position:0%
in the combin combined reporting is not
uh

05:10:15.390 --> 05:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.788 --> 05:10:17.798 align:start position:0%
permitted that's how you do business
 
05:10:19.670 --> 05:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
taxes isn't
 
05:10:25.628 --> 05:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:28.390 --> 05:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
information General
 
05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
yes follow up follow so there would be
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
no way that the state of New Hampshire
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
could do any tax analysis as to whether
 
05:10:43.708 --> 05:10:43.718 align:start position:0%
or not the entity was how they were
 
05:10:45.788 --> 05:10:45.798 align:start position:0%
operating or anything because we don't
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
collect that data independent of the IRS
 
05:10:48.160 --> 05:10:49.190 align:start position:0%
collect that data independent of the IRS
records

05:10:49.190 --> 05:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
records
 
05:10:51.990 --> 05:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
correct so I'm not entirely certain what
 
05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
the that language in the bill is
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
intended to accomplish um if if the
 
05:10:59.868 --> 05:10:59.878 align:start position:0%
intent of that language is to indicate
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
that we should be considering whether a
 
05:11:04.230 --> 05:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise meets the
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
qualifications in the statute based not
 
05:11:09.070 --> 05:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
on a Consolidated Enterprise but based
 
05:11:12.030 --> 05:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
on one individual component of what
 
05:11:14.670 --> 05:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
would ordinarily be combined reporting
 
05:11:17.350 --> 05:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
um then I think we could um engage in
 
05:11:19.310 --> 05:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
that analysis if I'm understanding the
 
05:11:19.320 --> 05:11:20.830 align:start position:0%
that analysis if I'm understanding the
bill

05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:11:23.230 --> 05:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
correctly in that case what would be the
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
cost or could you determine the cost or
 
05:11:27.868 --> 05:11:27.878 align:start position:0%
an estimate of the cost and add that to
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note uh so the uh we did not
 
05:11:33.310 --> 05:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there would be any
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
additional cost um to administer this
 
05:11:40.350 --> 05:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
statute over and above our or ordinary
 
05:11:43.470 --> 05:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
operating costs um with that
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of the statute in
 
05:11:48.030 --> 05:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
mind thank
 
05:11:50.948 --> 05:11:50.958 align:start position:0%
you any other questions represent
 
05:11:53.830 --> 05:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
elme yes
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
um the bill seems
 
05:12:01.230 --> 05:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
to assuming that you are going to be
 
05:12:05.788 --> 05:12:05.798 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh accepting
 
05:12:07.628 --> 05:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:12:10.030 --> 05:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
analyzing I presume
 
05:12:10.040 --> 05:12:11.628 align:start position:0%
analyzing I presume
verifying

05:12:11.628 --> 05:12:11.638 align:start position:0%
verifying
 
05:12:15.548 --> 05:12:15.558 align:start position:0%
on any complaints that come in that
 
05:12:21.150 --> 05:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
there a particular NGO is engaging in
 
05:12:24.750 --> 05:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
supporting illegal
 
05:12:24.760 --> 05:12:26.788 align:start position:0%
supporting illegal
immigrants

05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
05:12:30.750 --> 05:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
on what would it take to add that to the
 
05:12:30.760 --> 05:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
on what would it take to add that to the
the

05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:36.030 --> 05:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
Dr as we understand the Bill's
 
05:12:38.670 --> 05:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh with respect to Dr
 
05:12:42.110 --> 05:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
this would create uh potentially an
 
05:12:44.910 --> 05:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
additional group of taxpayers uh and we
 
05:12:47.548 --> 05:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
do currently have in place what we call
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
sort of the fraud hotline um we would
 
05:12:53.548 --> 05:12:53.558 align:start position:0%
anticipate just like with with any
 
05:12:55.390 --> 05:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
entity that should be paying tax that is
 
05:12:57.390 --> 05:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
not being pay that is not paying their
 
05:12:59.788 --> 05:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
tax we do get those calls we would
 
05:13:01.670 --> 05:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
assume these calls would come in in that
 
05:13:04.628 --> 05:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
same manner identifying an organization
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh and we would uh look into as a part
 
05:13:09.628 --> 05:13:09.638 align:start position:0%
of the duties of our audit division
 
05:13:14.190 --> 05:13:14.200 align:start position:0%
would look into those um uh those
 
05:13:16.110 --> 05:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
potential taxpayers and whether or not
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
they would need to start paying tax um
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
we would investigate that the same way
 
05:13:23.628 --> 05:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
that we currently do with respect to all
 
05:13:28.628 --> 05:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers thank you and follow would you
 
05:13:33.110 --> 05:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
need on some kind of guidance as
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
to the NGO in
 
05:13:40.548 --> 05:13:40.558 align:start position:0%
question had uh
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
had dealt with one case or uh for a long
 
05:13:49.830 --> 05:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
time or just dealt with with one case
 
05:13:50.910 --> 05:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
over a
 
05:13:55.390 --> 05:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
weekend uh that was an illegal
 
05:13:55.400 --> 05:13:57.590 align:start position:0%
weekend uh that was an illegal
migrant

05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
migrant
 
05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
um on would would you ha have to go
 
05:14:07.190 --> 05:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
into uh removing their tax status in New
 
05:14:10.990 --> 05:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or
 
05:14:14.070 --> 05:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
um would you would you be required to do
 
05:14:17.350 --> 05:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
that if we didn't have any kind of
 
05:14:20.510 --> 05:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
limits on this thing so the bill
 
05:14:24.150 --> 05:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
provides a definition at
 
05:14:24.160 --> 05:14:25.830 align:start position:0%
provides a definition at
U

05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
U
 
05:14:30.230 --> 05:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
on lines um 19 through the beginning of
 
05:14:32.070 --> 05:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
the top of the next page provides a
 
05:14:35.548 --> 05:14:35.558 align:start position:0%
definition of what uh constitutes I'm
 
05:14:37.270 --> 05:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
sorry starting at line
 
05:14:41.230 --> 05:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
25 and going on um it's provides a
 
05:14:43.150 --> 05:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
definition of what constitutes settling
 
05:14:45.948 --> 05:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
and resettling um and that is the
 
05:14:48.628 --> 05:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
criteria that we would utilize in
 
05:14:50.390 --> 05:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
analyzing whether someone needed to
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
begin paying
 
05:14:54.070 --> 05:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
tax you follow
 
05:14:57.390 --> 05:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
up so that would mean
 
05:14:59.310 --> 05:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
if an
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
organization which was in general doing
 
05:15:07.708 --> 05:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
charitable work in the state and had one
 
05:15:10.670 --> 05:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
case of somebody that they hadn't
 
05:15:13.110 --> 05:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
realized was an illegal immigrant or
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
that they had realized was an illegal
 
05:15:19.230 --> 05:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
immigrant that also got help uh would
 
05:15:21.788 --> 05:15:21.798 align:start position:0%
have their tax status removed
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
potentially yes the bill doesn't talk
 
05:15:26.110 --> 05:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
about substantially or materially it
 
05:15:28.030 --> 05:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
just simply defines what it would mean
 
05:15:31.190 --> 05:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
to do the kind of work that would mean
 
05:15:32.830 --> 05:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
an entity needed to be subject to the
 
05:15:34.470 --> 05:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
tax thank
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
you no
 
05:15:42.868 --> 05:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
that okay represent ORS thank you Mr
 
05:15:44.670 --> 05:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
05:15:47.230 --> 05:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
so are the revenue estimates for the
 
05:15:51.070 --> 05:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
upcoming year above plan or below plan
 
05:15:54.270 --> 05:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
so the revenue estimates for the
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
upcoming year um there's has not been a
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
plan established with respect to the the
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
future years but if you're talking about
 
05:16:02.670 --> 05:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
how we're doing for the remainder of the
 
05:16:04.470 --> 05:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year we are coming in
 
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
below plan below plan so with taxing
 
05:16:10.708 --> 05:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
these organizations help that deficit um
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
well I think the effective date of this
 
05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
would be after the um upcoming fiscal
 
05:16:17.548 --> 05:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
year but uh this could potentially be a
 
05:16:21.390 --> 05:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
revenue increasing measure follow up so
 
05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
would you uh are you willing to look
 
05:16:25.548 --> 05:16:25.558 align:start position:0%
into the fact whether or not the these
 
05:16:27.868 --> 05:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
organizations should be taxed and get
 
05:16:30.590 --> 05:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
back to us I'm not sure what you mean by
 
05:16:33.270 --> 05:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to to check into this
 
05:16:35.070 --> 05:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
this representative I don't I don't
 
05:16:36.430 --> 05:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
think they they're not gonna they can't
 
05:16:38.190 --> 05:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
determine whether there's taxation this
 
05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
bill is it's a policy thing thank you
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
yeah done okay uh any other
 
05:16:50.430 --> 05:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
you okay is there anyone else who wishes
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
to testify who has not
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
testified seeing none I'm going to close
 
05:17:00.190 --> 05:17:00.200 align:start position:0%
the hearing on HB
 
05:17:03.510 --> 05:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
635 be careful my phone is right there
 
05:17:08.990 --> 05:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:42.190 --> 05:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:44.430 --> 05:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
I think uh this is this is one bill that
 
05:17:47.230 --> 05:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
we will or one of the bills that we'll
 
05:17:49.708 --> 05:17:49.718 align:start position:0%
have probably have a work session on to
 
05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
come to a conclusion so that that
 
05:17:54.628 --> 05:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
concludes our work for this week uh next
 
05:17:58.110 --> 05:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
week we are scheduled for Monday Tuesday
 
05:18:03.190 --> 05:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
and Wednesday again um but um and it's
 
05:18:05.030 --> 05:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the F it's TVD but the following
 
05:18:07.708 --> 05:18:07.718 align:start position:0%
week we may only meet one day we may
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
only meet on Wednesday that has not been
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
determined yet but it at most it would
 
05:18:14.150 --> 05:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
be two days not next week so next week
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
is three days the following week is
 
05:18:17.510 --> 05:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
either one or two days the following
 
05:18:19.990 --> 05:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
week which is the vacation week I'm not
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
going to schedule anything there's no
 
05:18:23.788 --> 05:18:23.798 align:start position:0%
house session scheduled I won't schedule
 
05:18:25.750 --> 05:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
any committee meeting so you'll have
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
that complete vacation week off which
 
05:18:30.750 --> 05:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it's the last week in February
 
05:18:33.548 --> 05:18:33.558 align:start position:0%
following into first couple days in
 
05:18:33.558 --> 05:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
following into first couple days in
March

05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
March
 
05:18:37.628 --> 05:18:37.638 align:start position:0%
UMES did you have something you wanted
 
05:18:42.590 --> 05:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
to say yeah on this is one of the early
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
bills so we have to figure out when work
 
05:18:52.350 --> 05:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
session well do we already have it um we
 
05:18:53.788 --> 05:18:53.798 align:start position:0%
have it scheduled I think for exec
 
05:19:00.070 --> 05:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:05.350 --> 05:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah if I'm not mistaken um in bills
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
that are complex and this then the
 
05:19:10.270 --> 05:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
language on this one is a little murky
 
05:19:14.110 --> 05:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
it's a lot murky but it has some Merit
 
05:19:15.270 --> 05:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:19:17.670 --> 05:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
examined one of the ways we can handle
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
that is to retain the
 
05:19:22.590 --> 05:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh so that when we have a little
 
05:19:24.350 --> 05:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
more after we got all the revenues done
 
05:19:26.110 --> 05:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
and all that stuff and depending upon
 
05:19:27.750 --> 05:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
how many Senate bills we can work on it
 
05:19:30.628 --> 05:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
a little bit uh through the rest of the
 
05:19:33.030 --> 05:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh winter and spring and then we can do
 
05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
it again in the fall to report out in
 
05:19:39.390 --> 05:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
November uh it's it's to be up to the
 
05:19:41.310 --> 05:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
chair and and to the ranking member as
 
05:19:43.628 --> 05:19:43.638 align:start position:0%
to what they want to do
 
05:19:46.590 --> 05:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to find the the email
 
05:19:48.750 --> 05:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
that I sent that
 
05:19:51.390 --> 05:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
let's I just want to verify that is on
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
for next week
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
um next Tuesday okay yeah thank you
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
starting at two o'clock we're executing
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
four bills next two well I had to put in
 
05:20:06.110 --> 05:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
a time uh we may not get to it till 3
 
05:20:09.910 --> 05:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
o'clock um we are doing um Revenue
 
05:20:12.350 --> 05:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
estimates all day
 
05:20:14.670 --> 05:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we're going to hear from Dr on
 
05:20:17.150 --> 05:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
Monday uh Monday morning probably 10 to
 
05:20:19.750 --> 05:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
12 Dr is going to give us their revenue
 
05:20:21.548 --> 05:20:21.558 align:start position:0%
estimates and those estimates account
 
05:20:25.110 --> 05:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
for about 70% of the
 
05:20:27.788 --> 05:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
total for for the state for the for over
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bium so that's extremely important
 
05:20:32.750 --> 05:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon on February Monday
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
February 10th we'll have our first work
 
05:20:38.350 --> 05:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
session on discussing where we think uh
 
05:20:40.990 --> 05:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
how do how do we you know all the the
 
05:20:42.830 --> 05:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
estimates that have come in from Dr the
 
05:20:45.150 --> 05:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
other agencies how do we feel about it
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
and um and how would we potentially
 
05:20:49.750 --> 05:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
modify it and then Tuesday and then
 
05:20:53.110 --> 05:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
following on that Tuesday 10 to 12 and
 
05:20:56.030 --> 05:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
and roughly 1 to two or one to three we
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
will continue to work on those estimates
 
05:21:00.670 --> 05:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
and see how much progress we're making
 
05:21:02.470 --> 05:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
um and I but I didn't want to schedule
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
the exact for three just in case we are
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
done a little earlier we can we can
 
05:21:09.150 --> 05:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
start at two you can always start later
 
05:21:11.590 --> 05:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
so I set it you'll see it at two it
 
05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
could slide a little bit but uh we've
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
got four bills now one of those four
 
05:21:20.750 --> 05:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
bills uh as Jennifer pointed out is
 
05:21:22.868 --> 05:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
6:35 and
 
05:21:28.310 --> 05:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
um at that point by then um I will
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
decide with help from others
 
05:21:35.070 --> 05:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
um should we just execute or should we
 
05:21:37.390 --> 05:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
combine a work session with the exe I
 
05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
can't notice a work session anymore but
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
we that doesn't stop us from executing
 
05:21:42.990 --> 05:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
it and talking about it if we feel like
 
05:21:44.708 --> 05:21:44.718 align:start position:0%
we can come to some conclusion one way
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
or another um
 
05:21:50.910 --> 05:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
or as Jordan pointed out I could um push
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
it off retain it and we can deal with it
 
05:21:57.070 --> 05:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
later so try to get a consensus of where
 
05:22:01.030 --> 05:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
we think we're at SC P want
 
05:22:03.470 --> 05:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
wait oh that's not a bad idea maybe we
 
05:22:06.590 --> 05:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
can do a straw pull now do to um what
 
05:22:07.830 --> 05:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
would the straw pull be what's your
 
05:22:09.628 --> 05:22:09.638 align:start position:0%
suggestion for the the straw ball and
 
05:22:11.390 --> 05:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
retain would
 
05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
be my suggestion would be to to give
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
this a good looking at uh and run it
 
05:22:22.270 --> 05:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
through in retain um because there there
 
05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
may be some things to it there I see
 
05:22:26.030 --> 05:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
some areas that need to be examined a
 
05:22:28.628 --> 05:22:28.638 align:start position:0%
little bit more deeply uh definitions
 
05:22:29.788 --> 05:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
05:22:33.310 --> 05:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
changed uh we essentially entail
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
rewriting the bill and we may come to
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
that conclusion very
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
rapidly um
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
but at the for the time being since it
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
has to be reported out by the 6th we
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
probably should be reported out as being
 
05:22:52.510 --> 05:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
retained uh would be my suggestion and
 
05:22:54.110 --> 05:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
well the choice I think the choices are
 
05:22:57.070 --> 05:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
retained or itl I'm not sure how it's
 
05:22:59.788 --> 05:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
OTP as it is without unless somebody
 
05:23:01.948 --> 05:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
wants to bring a
 
05:23:06.270 --> 05:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh no no March March 6th you're right
 
05:23:07.868 --> 05:23:07.878 align:start position:0%
the February 6th is tomorrow that's a
 
05:23:09.628 --> 05:23:09.638 align:start position:0%
good point
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
um so I mean I guess uh how do people
 
05:23:15.788 --> 05:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
feel do people how many people think we
 
05:23:17.430 --> 05:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
should retain it and then I'll ask how
 
05:23:22.788 --> 05:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
many people think we should itl it uh
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
contain one two three four five six
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
seven eight how many feel feel like it
 
05:23:35.070 --> 05:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
should be ited now one two three four
 
05:23:35.080 --> 05:23:39.230 align:start position:0%
should be ited now one two three four
five

05:23:39.230 --> 05:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:42.030 --> 05:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
you went on the wrong one so one two
 
05:23:45.070 --> 05:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven so now it's s
 
05:23:47.548 --> 05:23:47.558 align:start position:0%
seven okay that
 
05:23:50.190 --> 05:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
didn't that didn't work very well all
 
05:23:52.670 --> 05:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
right sorry about that well we'll uh we
 
05:23:55.270 --> 05:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
can make we can make that decision on
 
05:23:55.280 --> 05:23:59.350 align:start position:0%
can make we can make that decision on
next

05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.360 --> 05:24:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
Tuesday

05:24:01.110 --> 05:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah
 
05:24:06.548 --> 05:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
