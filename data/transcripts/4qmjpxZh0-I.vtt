00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
there were a number of
 
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
comments from people
 
00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 align:start position:0%
that the buyback was much more expensive
 
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
than they thought and some of them had
 
00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
mistaken assumptions on what they were
 
00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paying others
 
00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
we're not sure what happened so I've
 
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
invited the retirement system to tell us
 
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
how they're doing those calculations and
 
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
what if anything has changed since any
 
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
and that we will not I hope we will not
 
00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
be going off on to a lot of other issues
 
00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.850 align:start position:0%
be going off on to a lot of other issues
because

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
we need to cover this one specific
 
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.449 align:start position:0%
we need to cover this one specific
question

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Mark Cavanaugh I'm
 
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
interim Chief legal counsel for the
 
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
um not sure if you wanted to give me a
 
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
me to give a brief overview we just want
 
00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
to ask questions or
 
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
how do you want to proceed start with a
 
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
brief overview so we know which
 
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 align:start position:0%
questions to ask okay so SB 363
 
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
provides that certain group two members
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
who were in that middle tier
 
00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
of members who were employed on 112 but
 
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
did not have 10 years of service
 
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
and For Whom the minimum years of
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
service and age of retirement were
 
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 align:start position:0%
gradually increase based on how many
 
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
years of service they had at that time
 
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow the member to buy
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
back as many years of service necessary
 
00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
to get them to
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh be able to retire at age 45 and uh 20
 
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
years of service as was the law before
 
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.110 align:start position:0%
years of service as was the law before
2012.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
2012.
 
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
the law requires that the member paid
 
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
the full Actuarial cost of the years of
 
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.610 align:start position:0%
the full Actuarial cost of the years of
service

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
they can buy uh years of service in
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
increments of a year at a time no
 
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
partial years and based on how many
 
00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
years of service they had on 112 they
 
00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 align:start position:0%
can buy between one and four years of
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
service whatever is necessary to either
 
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.410 align:start position:0%
service whatever is necessary to either
reduce

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 align:start position:0%
their years of service
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
or add to the as a service to get to the
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to retire to the 20 or 8
 
00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 align:start position:0%
or to get their age to 45 whichever they
 
00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
need and some people need the age some
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
people need the service
 
00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
the full Actuarial cost is composed of
 
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
three elements the largest is the fact
 
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
that the members will be retiring
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
earlier and receiving their pension for
 
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
more years that makes up about
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the cost
 
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
and the second element of the cost is
 
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
the fact that by retiring earlier and
 
00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 align:start position:0%
not working for a couple more three four
 
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
more years we're not receiving
 
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
contributions on the pay they would have
 
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
received if they had continued working
 
00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 align:start position:0%
to the age that they were allowed to
 
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
retire under the law before the service
 
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
purchase in the last element of the cost
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
is a risk premium
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
that is built into uh at the
 
00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
recommendation of our actuaries Gabriel
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
Roeder and Smith
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
the risk premium is an additional 20
 
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.909 align:start position:0%
the risk premium is an additional 20
percent

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
and it is to account for three elements
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
and that is uh
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
investment performance
 
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
payroll experience and changes in
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions such as
 
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.290 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions such as
demographics

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
um and that that is basically how we've
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
come up with it the statute required us
 
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
to charge the full actual variable value
 
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
actuaries and this is what they
 
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.430 align:start position:0%
actuaries and this is what they
recommended

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it was adopted by the board
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
when I looked at it it appeared that by
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
buying service they also bought
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
themselves a larger pension because
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
they the stair step was from Two and a
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
half percent to two percent of salary so
 
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.650 align:start position:0%
half percent to two percent of salary so
that

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
even if they only bought one year they
 
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
were buying themselves a larger pension
 
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what you mean by entire
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
period but I will say that the law
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
provides that the multiplier for the
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
year used for the years you purchased
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
will be 2.5 your remaining years are
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
calculated based on where you fall in
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
that tier
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh but the additional years it's it's
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
not for you you aren't buying yourself
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
up to 2.5 for the 10 years in between no
 
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
okay just for the one to four years you
 
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 align:start position:0%
purchase would be calculated at 2.5 and
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
this is one of the elements that
 
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
challenged us technically to change our
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
system because our system uses the same
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
multiplier over the whole career of an
 
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
individual this now would require us to
 
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
have certain years at one multiplier or
 
00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
another year is that are different so
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of a technological
 
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
challenges and program involved okay
 
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
well thank you that explains it to me I
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
think any does anyone else have a yes
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt then
 
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
so I've been at this game for a number
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
of years as you know and we this is
 
00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
sounds very similar to the
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
situation that we had back in the past
 
00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:33.139 align:start position:0%
as you alluded to I think
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
and but we did Away With It about
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 years ago I think because it it
 
00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:45.419 align:start position:0%
was not actually Equitable for the
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
system it was costing the system more
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
than the people who are buying into it
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
were actually paying
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and according to what I've heard you
 
00:07:58.969 --> 00:07:58.979 align:start position:0%
say it seems like you've figured out a
 
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh a calculation that actually does pay
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
for itself in a way that does not harm
 
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
the system am I correcting that uh
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah if you're referring
 
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
to the short-lived program that allowed
 
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
members all members to buy up to five
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
years of service the methodology I
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
believe was based on contributions in
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
that in reality turned out to be
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh underestimating the actual cost and
 
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
the program only was in existence for a
 
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
year or so
 
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.230 align:start position:0%
year or so
um

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
this bill I believe originally was
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
proposed with a contribution methodology
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
of calculation which would have had the
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
member pay the combined employer and
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
employee rates
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
but I can say during
 
00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.170 align:start position:0%
but I can say during
um

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
deliberations of of the legislature that
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
was changed to full Actuarial cost
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
because the other method according to
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
our actuaries would have come up about
 
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:03.260 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars short
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
by their estimates and so it was
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
switched but I can say that
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
for example we've had 137 people apply
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
so far
 
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.910 align:start position:0%
so far
and

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
if it for the police that have applied
 
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019 align:start position:0%
there's 103 of them
 
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
if they had
 
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
been charged based on the contribution
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
method as the bill was originally
 
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:26.420 align:start position:0%
introduced it would have been
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
45.43 of their prior 12 months
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
conversation the Actuarial method on
 
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
average for the individuals who have
 
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
applied so far is 46.72 so about 1.3
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
percent higher with the Actuarial method
 
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
than under the contribution method as
 
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
originally proposed so there isn't a
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
significant difference between the two
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
methodologies at this point on the
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
average but for particular individuals
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
who have high compensation and are very
 
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
close to retirement their percentage
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
cost is going to be higher because
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
they're retiring sooner and they make
 
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
more money
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
if the contribution method on average is
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
very similar but it would have spread it
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
across the whole board across the board
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
such that members
 
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
who were retiring earlier are being
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
subsidized by members who were retiring
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
later and to the extent that subsidy
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
wasn't sufficient then the employer
 
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
would be subsidizing any shortfall in
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
so our actuaries felt that The Prudent
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
course of action was to look at the
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
demographics in the Actuarial
 
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
considerations of this particular cohort
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
of members of which there were I believe
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
1824 potential members who would be
 
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
eligible for this benefit that
 
00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:50.779 align:start position:0%
represents about
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
3.75 of our active membership in total
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
and so the Actuarial assumptions look
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
particularly at the individuals and just
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
by definition if someone is buying one
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
year and is now able to retire on
 
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
November 1st instead of November 1st
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
next year that person's cost is going to
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
be more because it's closer in time and
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
so you can see that the percentages vary
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
from as as low as uh 35 percent to as
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
high as 70 percent depending on the
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
individual's situation we feel that's a
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
more accurate cost because it's being
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
assessed to the individuals
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
to whom the cost is attributable rather
 
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:35.579 align:start position:0%
than an average basis across the whole
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
population of people who are eligible
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
that certainly does sound like the
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
Equitable way to do it you shouldn't be
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
getting more than you're entitled to or
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
less if you're entitled to but the
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
concern consideration and the concern we
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
had at the time the change was made was
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
that it was not Equitable for the system
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
the system was wind up being harmed
 
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
sounds we have some very experienced
 
00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339 align:start position:0%
members so I hope this will be pursued
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
by some of them who have questions thank
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you representative
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:10.579 align:start position:0%
I have a couple and I'll start with
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
adherence let's say to the statute there
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
strict interpretation of this piece of
 
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
legislation until you get to a couple of
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
points I.E we'll start with the
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
installed payment portion
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
which it appears the retirement system
 
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
is unwilling to comply with
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
as I've been told after making multiple
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
requests up there as to what that
 
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
payment method is going to look like I
 
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
was told the retirement system is not
 
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
interested in implementing that portion
 
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
of the statute is that still true
 
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
yes the board has uh determined not to
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
exercise this discretion under the
 
00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:53.339 align:start position:0%
statute to allow for installment
 
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
payments the only service purchases for
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
which we do allow installment payments
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
are what we call employer oversight
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
which is when an employer fails to
 
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
enroll someone when they're first hired
 
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
enroll someone when they're first hired
um

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
one of the or the biggest barrier
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
or obstacle to installment payments is
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
the fact that if someone comes in and
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
buys a year and retires on 11-1
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
over what period of time you have to pay
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
for it before you retire
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
and if we were to give someone an
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
installment payment for his four years
 
00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
and you retire 11-1
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to give you the
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
increased benefit until four years later
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
when you're finished paying now we've
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
got to go back and recalculate and give
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
you the money
 
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh that you owed now that you're fully
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
paid it just wasn't as feasible
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
to have an installment payment for
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
people who by definition are applying
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
for this to retire sooner rather than
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
later although I will say that um many
 
00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
of the members that have applied a
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
particularly those who are requesting
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
the full four years still have quite a
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
few years to go even with the fort to
 
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.710 align:start position:0%
few years to go even with the fort to
retire

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
retire
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
um but it was the board's determination
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
that in installment payments uh
 
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
weren't as feasible in this situation so
 
00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:19.019 align:start position:0%
we uh they decided not to exercise their
 
00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
we uh they decided not to exercise their
discretion

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that you we're
 
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
also looking at here from understanding
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
what you're telling me is that you're
 
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the employee portion the
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
employer portion the uaal portion and
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
then you're slapping a 20 penalty on top
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
of all of that
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
now that is certainly as you've alluded
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
to different
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
than what was done in roughly 12 years
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
ago that is not how that was calculated
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
and I don't recall a single discussion
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
in either the house or the senate in
 
00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
this being done in a different manner
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
than it was done
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
12 years ago so this this came as a is a
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
big surprise to me but just so just so I
 
00:15:18.009 --> 00:15:18.019 align:start position:0%
can get the clarification here the uaal
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
employer penalty is part of the
 
00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
calculation you're using to determine
 
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:26.820 align:start position:0%
what someone has to pay for a year of
 
00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.069 align:start position:0%
what someone has to pay for a year of
service

00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
uh no I think you're mixing apples and
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
oranges uaal is a portion of the
 
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
employer contribution attributable to
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
the underfunding employer con
 
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
contributions in general are split into
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
two categories
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
the amount needed to fund the
 
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
underfunding and the amount needed to
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
pay for the annual accrual of this
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
year's benefit the normal cost the
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
member contributions make up about 75
 
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
percent of the normal cost the employers
 
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
pay the other 25 percent of the normal
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
cost in the employer contribution
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh pays for all of the underfunding it's
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
a underfunding in the uaal is a
 
00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:11.329 align:start position:0%
a underfunding in the uaal is a
contribution

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:11.339 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
based concept
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
this calculation is not based on
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
contributions it's based on the
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
Actuarial value in other words we
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
calculate what is your pension now
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
what will your pension be after you
 
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
purchase it
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
calculate the present value of each of
 
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
those and the cost is the difference
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
that is to which that is the number on
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
which the premium is applied it has
 
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the uaal which is a
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
contribution concept it has to do with
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
that what is the difference what is the
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
difference in the present value of a
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
member's benefit before and after the
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
purchase that's the dollar number
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
against which the risk premium is
 
00:16:58.249 --> 00:16:58.259 align:start position:0%
assessed okay follow-up
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
so if if that's the case I've seen I've
 
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:05.579 align:start position:0%
had people send me pictures of the
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
letter they got back from the retirement
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
system indicating the the dollar amount
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
per year some of which are well into six
 
00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:12.909 align:start position:0%
per year some of which are well into six
figures

00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
figures
 
00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:17.059 align:start position:0%
and looking at what an Actuarial
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of someone looks at lifespan
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
and other things as you know when you
 
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
got how old you are when you got in the
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
system those sort of things
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
and doing some quick math on those it
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
would be impossible impossible for the
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
member to break even in their lifetime
 
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
what is being charged to them for this
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
so there's no way that you're going to
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
pay for something to which you will
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
never break even that doesn't that's
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
that doesn't pass a sniff test with me
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative Pearson I think that
 
00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
it'd be fair to say that it would only
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
break even if the person were to live as
 
00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
long as they were expected to plus the
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
risk premium so yes if you're
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh it it shouldn't be cheap and when we
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
discussed it we said this is going to be
 
00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
expensive and everyone agreed sure but
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
I've seen numbers as high as 125 000 per
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
year which is atrocious atrocious
 
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
to charge someone representative Pearson
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
do you have a question or is this a
 
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.470 align:start position:0%
do you have a question or is this a
speech

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
speech
 
00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539 align:start position:0%
I'll get to the question part thank you
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
please do
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
do you think and is it of the opinion of
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
the board of the New Hampshire
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system that the idea was for
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
these members to purchase something to
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
enter into retirement having to fully
 
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:36.539 align:start position:0%
mortgage a home and to go into massive
 
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:38.820 align:start position:0%
debt just to Simply get out when they
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
were promised originally
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
oh I can't speak to the intent of the
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
board I can speak to what I know and
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
respectfully I think your math is
 
00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.289 align:start position:0%
respectfully I think your math is
incorrect

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
in fact two-thirds of the cost would be
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
recovered in the additional pension that
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
the member would receive by being able
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
to retire early one to four years
 
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
depending on how many they purchase I'll
 
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
give you one example there was a member
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
who was concerned about the cost
 
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:10.460 align:start position:0%
he would he would recover
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of his cost in the first year
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
he was retired his benefit would then be
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
increased monthly after that such that
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
after eight years of retirement he would
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
have recovered his full cost the basic
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
design of it is you are paying for an
 
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
additional benefit so that over the life
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
of your retirement your cost will equal
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
the extra benefit on a present value
 
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.750 align:start position:0%
the extra benefit on a present value
basis

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um so it it is it is categorically
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
untrue that it's impossible for someone
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
to recover the money in fact
 
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
mathematically it is designed and when
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
the the only people in my view that
 
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recover the money are those who
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
die earlier than their life expectancy
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
so one last question in reference to the
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
103 people that applied those are people
 
00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:04.559 align:start position:0%
that applied how many actually agreed so
 
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
far to to the terms that were laid
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
forward to them a handful because we
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
just finished uh our programming and
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
I've just started to be able to
 
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.059 align:start position:0%
calculate and send out bills and and
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
actually process in the system the
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
payments and so I can't I can't it I
 
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
checked with staff this morning she said
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
about five or six but we didn't have
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
stats on that okay thank you
 
00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:31.160 align:start position:0%
representative leckis and then Allegra
 
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
um first part of my question was
 
00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:36.539 align:start position:0%
answered about the uaal
 
00:20:36.539 --> 00:20:37.669 align:start position:0%
answered about the uaal
um

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
but what I will ask is I understand
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
depending on how close someone is to
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
retirement their salary and I'm sure
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
other factors how much they would have
 
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
to pay is going to vary but uh
 
00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
can you provide like two or three kind
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
of scenarios that cover that range what
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
their circumstances are and what it
 
00:20:59.810 --> 00:20:59.820 align:start position:0%
would cost for them to buy additional
 
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.150 align:start position:0%
would cost for them to buy additional
years

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:04.460 align:start position:0%
um I can't speak to any
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
individuals you know particularly but I
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
can say that generally
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
um one example is there's a corrections
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
officer through a tremendous amount of
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
overtime made 250 000 last year and and
 
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
she wanted to buy four years and the
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
cost is almost four hundred thousand
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
dollars because she has such a high
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
salary she's buying four years and
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's what it costs the cost is
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
what the cost is
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
um really what we're discussing here I
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
think is who's going to pay that cost
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
um so the cost is the number and that's
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
what it is and if
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
um if you were to reduce the cost for
 
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
the people buying it someone else has to
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
we've gone through a bit of a maze since
 
00:21:57.409 --> 00:21:57.419 align:start position:0%
the question occurred to me a few
 
00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
minutes ago so I may ask representative
 
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
Pearson to repeat the original question
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
but uh it occurred to me at the time to
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
ask is the discretion that you mentioned
 
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh installments I believe it's uh
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative would you please repeat
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
exactly what you were asking about well
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
um represent Allegro if if you're
 
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
referring to the installment the payment
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
portion that is yes listed in in the
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
language of the statute
 
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing listed in the statute
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
in reference to a 20 penalty there's
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
nothing listed in the statute about
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
other specific elements that the board
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
has chosen to do so it's like the pen
 
00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
the payment part of that
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
because I actually had to pull it up
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
is in the first is in the first portion
 
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
it specifies that the
 
00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
full Actuarial cost of service credit
 
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.299 align:start position:0%
determined by the actuary based on
 
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
methods and assumptions recommended by
 
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
the actuary and approved by the Board of
 
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
the actuary and approved by the Board of
Trustees

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
Trustees
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
pert on the
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
as a lump sum or
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
installment payments as permitted by the
 
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.490 align:start position:0%
installment payments as permitted by the
board

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
and that gave them full discretion we
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
may not have upon more mature
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
recollection we may not have wanted to
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
give them full discretion but as of now
 
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
that they have this they have full
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
discretion the board yes
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
and you concur with that
 
00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
I I concur with that interpretation yes
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
the board the statute as written gives
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
the board full discretion to determine
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
whether installment payments are
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate and at this point they have
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
decided not to exercise that discretion
 
00:23:53.049 --> 00:23:53.059 align:start position:0%
for the reasons I stated earlier primary
 
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
primarily being it may not someone's
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
retiring soon you don't have an
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
installment period all our service
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
purchases of all type have to be paid
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
for before you retire thank you
 
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.210 align:start position:0%
for before you retire thank you
okay

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative blackis
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
on that point was there any
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
consideration given that you know by the
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
board on
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know if people have enough years
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
left to permit installment in that
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
situation where they might not have the
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
complications no
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I I would just like to clarify that
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
the 20 is a risk premium it is a
 
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
component of the full Actuarial cost
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a penalty that we slap on top
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty involved here this is
 
00:24:45.289 --> 00:24:45.299 align:start position:0%
a determination of the full actual cost
 
00:24:48.649 --> 00:24:48.659 align:start position:0%
it has three components
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
The increased benefit by retiring
 
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
earlier the Lost contributions by
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
retiring earlier in a risk premium
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
to shift the risk that if the Actuarial
 
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
to shift the risk that if the Actuarial
assumptions

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
are incorrect in the long term because
 
00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
of differences in experience investment
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
performance demographics that that risk
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
is borne by the person buying the
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
service and not by the system as a whole
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
does the does the uaal figure into this
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
calculation no
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought I understood the
 
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
other question is this let's say in
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
employee a pays the 400 000 somehow
 
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900 align:start position:0%
are you saying with this two-thirds
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
number that if that person's lifespan is
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
eight years that in eight years that
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
person will recover two-thirds of the
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
four hundred thousand yes in that
 
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
scenario they'll they'll start their
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
benefit four years earlier so they have
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
four years of a benefit let's say it's
 
00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
they've got the 20 years of service and
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
their benefit is 50 of their pay or
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of 250 down that's 125 000
 
00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:09.299 align:start position:0%
times four years
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
right there they're making back like all
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I I some of the
 
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
terms that have come up in your response
 
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
to our questions
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
have you know uh been along the lines of
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
where I was going that there are a
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
number of assumptions that are made uh
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
by the uh by the actuary and so forth
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
but also that by the proponents and
 
00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.299 align:start position:0%
presumably by the opponents as well and
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's the thing I am concerned about is
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
if you're making assumptions uh and
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
either the investment uh you know
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't pan out as well or whatever then
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
you can be quite uh you know you miss
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
the the uh the porch you're steering for
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
because you uh move the tiller the wrong
 
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
way at the wrong time uh and because
 
00:27:17.649 --> 00:27:17.659 align:start position:0%
this is all subject to Future
 
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
developments that are projected or
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
predicted that may not be real
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
uh I'm wondering whether we've whether
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
we've thought it through enough and
 
00:27:30.169 --> 00:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
calculated it perhaps by the opponents
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
and representative Pearson has already
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
suggested certain aspects that seem
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
unworkable to him
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
so I I just wonder whether we've had
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
enough enough looks at this proposal to
 
00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:45.500 align:start position:0%
see whether we're
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
definitely not harming the system
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
because if we are then everybody is
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
paying besides the person that has the
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
benefit potentially
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's inherent in any Actuarial
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
calculations that your underlying
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
assumptions may turn out not to be true
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know you you know predictions are
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
predictions uh and that is why we felt
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the risk premium was appropriate to
 
00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
address that and assess to the
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
individual buying the service the risk
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
that those actual assumptions may not
 
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
bear over the long term yeah I would
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
like to comment that the
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
the risk of this is significant because
 
00:28:26.409 --> 00:28:26.419 align:start position:0%
they're getting
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
the earlier retirement sooner uh right
 
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
up front rather than in the distant
 
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.409 align:start position:0%
up front rather than in the distant
future

00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:33.419 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
and the people that are likely to do
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
this are the people that anticipate they
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
will be living long enough to collect a
 
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:43.980 align:start position:0%
larger pension for longer
 
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.510 align:start position:0%
larger pension for longer
um

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
that that's always a risk factor in any
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
retirement scenario that the long-lived
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
people will uh
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
want to get bigger pensions well I I
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
believe you've hit on a good point and
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
that is that there is an element of what
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
we refer to as adverse selection and
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
that is those who most likely to benefit
 
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:07.799 align:start position:0%
are most likely to purchase and that's
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
one of the minor factors uh in terms of
 
00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:13.100 align:start position:0%
the other Actuarial factors
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
investment performance
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
payroll growth
 
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.370 align:start position:0%
payroll growth
demographics

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
we used our normal Actuarial assumptions
 
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
which are set based on our actual
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
studies that we do every five years to
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
readjust those factors for changes it's
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
not like we set a factor now and that's
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
those those are the assumptions we're
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
going to use for 20 years they're
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
Revisited every five years but based on
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
the currently effective assumptions
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
those were the Baseline that was used in
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
these calculations and they were tweaked
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
around the edges to address the
 
00:29:50.649 --> 00:29:50.659 align:start position:0%
differences in this population
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
one of which is now you have people
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
retiring at 45. not 60 like the vast
 
00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:00.059 align:start position:0%
majority of members so there's a longer
 
00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:03.059 align:start position:0%
period of time from retirement to death
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
no no I'm comparing I'm comparing it to
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
group ones what I'm saying is
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is the Actuarial
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
assumptions took into account the fact
 
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460 align:start position:0%
that these members will be retiring at
 
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
an earlier age and therefore there is a
 
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
longer period of time over which
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
Actuarial assumptions may turn out to be
 
00:30:33.169 --> 00:30:33.179 align:start position:0%
true or not true your window will risk
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
that your predictions are inaccurate is
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
longer when someone retires at 45 than
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
when someone retires at 60. and that's
 
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
chair I I just had a short question how
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
common is it for pension plans to have
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
this option of people to buy credit
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
in this manner
 
00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
um we're unique because our tiered
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
group two middle tier
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
for for those folks is unique
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
when that was put into place
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
um however
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
public plans across the country have
 
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
various types of service purchase
 
00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
oversight military service purchase is a
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
very common one
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
some people allow out-of-state service
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
we used to allow it if a teacher from
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts came here they could take
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
their money out of the Massachusetts
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
plan and buy the time in our plan we
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
don't do that anymore other states do
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
service purchase is a very non-qualified
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
service purchases meaning ones that
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
aren't based on your actual work service
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
but you're buying time for other reasons
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
we have military service we have Peace
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
Corps Service we have oversight we have
 
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
prior temporary service if someone came
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
in and worked in a temporary job and
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
then became full-time they could go back
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
and buy the time for when they were in
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
the temporary position in that case the
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
member pays the full cost
 
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
so there are a variety of service
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
purchases and and we offer most of them
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
in other states similarly do but one
 
00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's exactly like this no because
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
we're unique in our benefit structure
 
00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
that way representative scitec
 
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
does oversight mean is that a synonym
 
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
for employer error yes employer
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
oversighted a failure to enroll at the
 
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
allow service Time by and that that is
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's based on a contribution
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
calculation not an Actuarial cost
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's different
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
matter yes yes one more element to this
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
and that was the intent of Senator de la
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
Sandra's filing of this is the fact that
 
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it's not bipologist there's
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
one more element of this representative
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
fellows in the fact that changes were
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
made to the pension system retroactively
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
that that is unique to New Hampshire as
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
well so you have to look at the intent
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
here as to why representative goalie and
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
Senator D'Alessandro brought this
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
forward and that's a major element to
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
the to the crew the whole reason this
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
bill exists
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
yes however the bill is not as it was
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
originally introduced it was
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
significantly modified in the Senate the
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
house just Pat did not make any
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
amendments it was changed in the Senate
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
to to Simply require the full Actuarial
 
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.570 align:start position:0%
to to Simply require the full Actuarial
cost

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
which is their prerogative and whether
 
00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:39.179 align:start position:0%
it's the the sponsor's intent or not
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
that's what the law is
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
correct except that she asked what are
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
some of the underlying elements as to
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
how these things come about and I just
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that was a
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
factor specifically to New Hampshire as
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
to why this came about yes thank you
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
yes I I'm rather disappointed that the
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
board has
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
decided no installment payments under
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
any circumstances
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I would think that they should take
 
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
a look at that decision particularly for
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
people that are buying significant
 
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
amounts of time
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that you know they are planning to
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
have an installment payment completed
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
before they retire because that would be
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
if that's their plan we should we should
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
encourage them to do that because it's
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
not everybody can just up and write a
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
check for four hundred thousand dollars
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
right well certainly I'll bring that
 
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
back to the board and mention it uh to
 
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
our benefits committee we have a meeting
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
scheduled uh coming up the first week of
 
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
October I'll put that on the agenda uh
 
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
frankly there were so many moving parts
 
00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
from an implementation point of view
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
that in order to get this in place so
 
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
that people can retire
 
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
right away if the purchase allows them
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
to do that we wanted to get it in place
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible is a lot of
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
programming a lot of administrative work
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
changes in processes
 
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
that were involved that
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
probably put aside the installment part
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
of it for now because that was one more
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
element that would have delayed
 
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.630 align:start position:0%
element that would have delayed
implementation

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
but I think you make a valid point if
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
someone's buying four years and that
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
allows them to retire four years early
 
00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
but that's still six years from now
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps installment would be appropriate
 
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that is if you look at it
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
again representative Lucas
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:36.770 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
I just I I understand the reason for
 
00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
some risk premium I'd be interested to
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
know you know the justification with the
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
20 number
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
and and how that was calculated
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
especially given that you know risk of
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
being incorrect can go both ways and uh
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
you know if uh the fair the several
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
factors you mentioned
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh ended up turning more in the uh to
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the pension fund
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
then you've gotten people to pay money
 
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
and and that's you know never going to
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
go back to them right so no so how a
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
little more about the details on how
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
that 20 was uh developed well again it's
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
comprised of basically three components
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
the investment performance that the risk
 
00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:28.820 align:start position:0%
that investment performance will not be
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
as high as estimated and we currently
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
have assumed rate of return of
 
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:38.660 align:start position:0%
6.75 percent
 
00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
which is fairly robust we've always met
 
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
that based on 1 5 10 20 years back we've
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
met our assumed rate of return
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
um but you don't know where markets are
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
going in the future the second element
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
of that is a payroll experience
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
and by that I mean built into the
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
assumption is
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
um certain uh
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
assumptions that
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
payroll growth will be x amount and
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
those are the contributions that will be
 
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
coming in across the board for active
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
employees and if payroll growth doesn't
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
meet that expectation that's another
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
risk and the third risk was just the
 
00:37:25.849 --> 00:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
pure demographic risk that someone would
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
okay uh thanks for that I I get that I'm
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
just curious how they factored in
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
um the possibility that you know things
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
could go in the other direction that you
 
00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
know the investment
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh the rate rate of return could be
 
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
higher than expected payrolls could grow
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
more than expected
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
right um and then the average lifespan
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the people who chose this um
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
we're not as long as expected so how is
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
it when you calculate the 20 risk
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
premium how is that possibility factored
 
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:03.530 align:start position:0%
premium how is that possibility factored
in

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
to come up with I'm just curious how
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
that number came to be I understand the
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
factors that are going into it but I
 
00:38:08.339 --> 00:38:09.470 align:start position:0%
factors that are going into it but I
understood

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
um well I'm not an actuary
 
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
and they're very complicated
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
mathematical formulas that they use they
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
run iterations and and come out with the
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
norm or an average that they feel is
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate and in this case
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
they recommended the 20 how they do the
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
underlying math I'm a lawyer
 
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you madam
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:39.950 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh I heard you in your testimony and you
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times and you hit the
 
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.329 align:start position:0%
mentioned several times and you hit the
point

00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
that and one would say probably if they
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
just stepped into the room that the
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
attention of this bill was to have
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
people retire early
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
but was it not really because where the
 
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
pension system had changed these people
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
had started were not yet vested at the
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
10 years into the particular system yes
 
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:11.579 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien let's not rehash
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
10 years of history no but no but to get
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
to the point Thank you madam chair and I
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
do ask for very briefly and thank you
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
for your courtesy
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh but that's what really brought us
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
here with this because uh the thing is
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
so do you think when we write a bill we
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
may not get it 100 correct but it sounds
 
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
like we missed the mock if Our intention
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
was trying to uh help out the people
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
that were in the process when this was
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh first started would you agree with
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
that I can't speak to the intent of the
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
legislature's legislators rather but uh
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
my view was that the purpose of this
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill was to allow people to buy the time
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
so that they could retire at the same
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
time they could have retired prior to
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
the changes in law in 2012.
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
the further determination was that if
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to do that they had to
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
pay for it and it was just a question of
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
who pays for it and what method and
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
that's the full Actuarial cost follow-up
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to change gears here uh for
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
clarity I retired member of the group 2
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
system okay uh my last paycheck to nhr
 
00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire retirement system
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
manage RS took out a pension payment
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
okay when did I actually get that money
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
you say there's a loss of Revenue but
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
when does that actually occur uh in
 
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
other words is that money that my last
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
paycheck that I had in my last
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
contribution to the New Hampshire
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
retirement system did not not go into
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
the gray pile get it reinvested and
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
could it perhaps make more so the less
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
isn't as the loss isn't as cute as maybe
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps what you're portraying it
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I followed that question
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
sir well in other words if I can clarify
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
president of O'Brien yeah
 
00:41:13.609 --> 00:41:13.619 align:start position:0%
the question is that a person who buys
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
back a year of service and retires in
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
2020 in 2022 instead of 2023 will not be
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
making payments for a year correct
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
okay that's the loss of contribution to
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
the retirement system okay but they they
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
are collect they do invest the money
 
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:36.660 align:start position:0%
even from your very last paycheck
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
and I would like to ask when in in
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
general a person who is retired gets
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
back their contributions without
 
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
interest or other growth do you know
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
that number well yeah when a person
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
retires their member account is
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
transferred to the state annuity account
 
00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.849 align:start position:0%
transferred to the state annuity account
and

00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
um based on the form of benefit they
 
00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:04.069 align:start position:0%
um based on the form of benefit they
choose

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
each payment
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
each annuity monthly annuity payment
 
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
reduces their member account month by
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
month by month there's two options to do
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
that one is fast one is a little bit
 
00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.230 align:start position:0%
that one is fast one is a little bit
slower

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
slower
 
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
It generally takes seven to ten years
 
00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
before the members account is exhausted
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
and from that point on the state annuity
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
yes forever from O'Brien yeah thank you
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank the chair for uh
 
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
clarifying the direction I was going
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank him Madam chair yes I mean that's
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
actually better than some because I
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
remember when I was working for a
 
00:42:46.849 --> 00:42:46.859 align:start position:0%
company that had a defined pension
 
00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:48.530 align:start position:0%
company that had a defined pension
contribution

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
Define benefit
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
pension that people were recovering
 
00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
their contributions in three to five
 
00:42:59.690 --> 00:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
years but that was some time ago
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
private plans have different Actuarial
 
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
assumptions that are imposed on them by
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government under erisa we're
 
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:08.099 align:start position:0%
not subject to that so their numbers are
 
00:43:08.099 --> 00:43:09.770 align:start position:0%
not subject to that so their numbers are
different

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
can't get this any closer I hope you can
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
hear me all right uh that seven to ten
 
00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:22.190 align:start position:0%
hear me all right uh that seven to ten
years

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
to to the point where you have I guess
 
00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
you would call it break even with your
 
00:43:28.859 --> 00:43:30.230 align:start position:0%
you would call it break even with your
contributions

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh does that apply to both group one and
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
group two individually or are they
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
co-mingled to come up with that uh just
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
it applies based on each individual how
 
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
much the benefit is and what the value
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
of their member account is which is
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
based on their contributions plus the
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
interest that was accrued to that and
 
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is that if someone
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
dies before that period of time unless
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
they pick the absolute maximum benefit
 
00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:59.569 align:start position:0%
they pick the absolute maximum benefit
um

00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
if there were re or a Survivor annuity
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
for a spouse if they said no I'm going
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
to take the second highest benefit just
 
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:09.660 align:start position:0%
for myself no Survivor annuity that's
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
gonna but if I die before my member
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
contributions are gone the excess gets
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
distributed to a beneficiary that I
 
00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:20.819 align:start position:0%
designate so that's an option the
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
balance of uh the remaining
 
00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:25.220 align:start position:0%
contributions on debt
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
that applies if you don't have a
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
Survivor beneficiary
 
00:44:32.809 --> 00:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
thank you just quick question on that so
 
00:44:34.609 --> 00:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
the amount in their account is just the
 
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
straight dollars that were contributed
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
for their pension um and that is that by
 
00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:41.339 align:start position:0%
both them and their employer that's the
 
00:44:43.809 --> 00:44:43.819 align:start position:0%
first part and second is that number
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
calculated uh without any uh assumed
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
interest on it
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
um that is member contributions only the
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
employer contributions go into the state
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
annuity fund the member annuity fund has
 
00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
individual accounts for each member
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
their contributions are posted to that
 
00:45:06.849 --> 00:45:06.859 align:start position:0%
account and interest is accrued and uh
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
applied to that account on a monthly
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
basis based on the assumed the lesser of
 
00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:17.579 align:start position:0%
the actual rate of return of the plan
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
for Investments over the last fiscal
 
00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.650 align:start position:0%
for Investments over the last fiscal
year

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
or six uh
 
00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:26.819 align:start position:0%
two percent less than the assumed rate
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
of return so the range now for interest
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
is between zero and four point seven
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
world I don't see any other obvious
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
questions so I'd like to thank you for
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
the information you're welcome and I
 
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.370 align:start position:0%
the information you're welcome and I
would

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:48.380 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
mention to other people that if we have
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
the if the law as implemented doesn't
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
meet what you what the intent was
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there will be attempts to fix
 
00:46:02.569 --> 00:46:02.579 align:start position:0%
it because
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
we often don't get the intent exactly
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
right on complicated things like this
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
I would lose leave then with this
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
closing note that the cost is what the
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
cost is and if you reduce it for the
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
person's purchasing it someone else has
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
got to pay it
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
yes that was the discussion we had in
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
this committee was that
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
it was a benefit for them under the
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
circumstances they were in to be able to
 
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
buy back some time
 
00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
and retire earlier or at a larger
 
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.970 align:start position:0%
and retire earlier or at a larger
pension

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:39.980 align:start position:0%
pension
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
and it would be expensive but for some
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
people it's worth it and so I'm I'm glad
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
you're able to at least get some people
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
started onto onto it
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
which do you have representative zaitek
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
when you're finished I have a comment oh
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay I think I don't see any other
 
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
questions so we do have some other
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
business we're going to vote out some of
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
our retained excuse me interim study
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
bills that we've completed the study on
 
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you very much Mr Kavanaugh
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
representative Saitek you have a comment
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I do this is an old comment rule me
 
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
out of order or stop me I'll try to keep
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
it short we've I want to blow a lot of
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
the technical foam off this beer and get
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
to the underlying equities it is just
 
00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
for me it has always been wrong to pull
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
the rug out from a police officer who
 
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:49.740 align:start position:0%
had six years to go six months to go and
 
00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
the whole thing's changed there this is
 
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
the danger of having Cliffs instead of
 
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
ramps where things taper off the room
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
would be empty if we had that the other
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
part is I think the state
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
somehow should accept some
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility or some measure not the
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
retirement system but we're forgiving a
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars electric bills whatever
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
it is we can help this middle tier
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
because we have quote improved the
 
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
system and in the meantime ground up the
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
middle tier and that seems that I'm
 
00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:29.579 align:start position:0%
willing to pay that price of helping
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
them out it's this is old news and I'm
 
00:48:32.339 --> 00:48:33.290 align:start position:0%
them out it's this is old news and I'm
done

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:44.329 --> 00:48:44.339 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone who had an interim
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
study have a motion I'd like to move on
 
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1395 which was revising the
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
gel car process
 
00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
that it's not recommended for further
 
00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:02.210 align:start position:0%
that it's not recommended for further
legislation

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'd like to say that the plan
 
00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the bill as written is totally
 
00:49:14.089 --> 00:49:14.099 align:start position:0%
unworkable and some of the concepts that
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
we thought about
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
can be implemented without legislation
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
so we can check it out and see if it see
 
00:49:23.809 --> 00:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
if it does work and I plan to do so in
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
the next year I don't think we need
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
legislation on this issue
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to comment on that
 
00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:41.390 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to comment on that
bill

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none the motion is not
 
00:49:47.569 --> 00:49:47.579 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation and
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
the clerk can call the rule
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.250 --> 00:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.630 align:start position:0%

premise I mean the subcommittee's
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
decision was unanimous but the
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
underlying premise was that uh this
 
00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
um within the framework of the amendment
 
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:10.260 align:start position:0%

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
the amendment had to do with the
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
um composition of the board
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
um the legislation originally changes so
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
that the midwives would be in a minority
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
and the amendment to restored uh one
 
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:39.480 align:start position:0%

00:53:57.589 --> 00:53:57.599 align:start position:0%

okay I don't see any other discussion so
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
the motion is to pursue further
 
00:54:02.579 --> 00:54:05.870 align:start position:0%
the motion is to pursue further
legislation

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.170 --> 00:54:08.180 align:start position:0%

00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien yes and the chair
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
and for those whose memory about interim
 
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
study bills
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
is not as good as it might be the
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation is simply whether we
 
00:54:58.089 --> 00:54:58.099 align:start position:0%
think it deserves further legislation
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
and any member can bring forth that
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
legislation if it's necessary
 
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.670 align:start position:0%
legislation if it's necessary
so

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
or any other legislative yes well that's
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
always it's that's always true
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
but in but if you recommend further
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it's a kind of a good
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
idea to to put it in yourself
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
representative fellows this is just a
 
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.099 align:start position:0%
process question is there a report
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere that that says why each each
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
person making the motion will be sending
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
me a blurb on why they recommend further
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
legislation and that will be published
 
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the calendar
 
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.630 align:start position:0%
in the calendar
[Music]

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes or just before the election
 
00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.730 align:start position:0%
sometimes or just before the election
usually

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
yeah the the reports are due uh usually
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
November 1st I think that's the time
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
frame still and so they would appear
 
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
sometime between that and the election
 
00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.549 align:start position:0%
sometime between that and the election
usually

00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
usually
 
00:55:58.559 --> 00:55:59.569 align:start position:0%
usually
yeah

00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:55:59.579 --> 00:56:01.250 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah and

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
well there's not much time between
 
00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
November 1st and the election it's the
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
eighth this year so there's a solid week
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
wow and and you had said uh anybody who
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
recommends for legislation knows you a
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
blurb I assume people owe you a blurb if
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
they recommend it the person who makes
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
the motion either way
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
the person who recommends legislation is
 
00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
normally expected to produce said
 
00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
legislation but if the if the
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation the subcommittee or of
 
00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
this committee is not to offer for the
 
00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
legislation I assume they're still a
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
blurb there's still a blurb okay thank
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
you I'm writing one
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else that have one that
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
they are they think is through Madam
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
chair I have one for house bill I think
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
it's 14 29 The Establishment massage
 
00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.490 align:start position:0%
it's 14 29 The Establishment massage
establishment

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
yes your motion
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
um my motion is to recommend for further
 
00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.130 align:start position:0%
um my motion is to recommend for further
legislation

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
okay then moved by uh represent grota
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
seconded by Schmidt you do you wish to
 
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes the committee
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
met and um
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
well subcommittee met excuse me and it
 
00:57:17.089 --> 00:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
was thought that the
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
bill could be
 
00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:23.660 align:start position:0%
refined to include local
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
authorities and we felt that that would
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
be inadequate that would be important to
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so we had a very
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
active subcommittee both in terms of
 
00:57:44.569 --> 00:57:44.579 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature of Edna but
 
00:57:51.069 --> 00:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
and it's uh seems perfectly obvious that
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing concern of
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
considerable significance in the in the
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
cities and towns affected such as
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
dairy in the meantime Merrimack I
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand uh has five or six of these
 
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:15.380 align:start position:0%
what I can refer to as massage parlors
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
uh and I was somewhat disconcerted to
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
discover that even Dover now has one
 
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:23.950 align:start position:0%
discover that even Dover now has one
establishment

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
establishment
 
00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:26.940 align:start position:0%
that I passed by on a regular basis on
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
my way to go grocery shopping it's you
 
00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
would think it's just an ordinary
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
residence and yet this illegal activity
 
00:58:36.609 --> 00:58:36.619 align:start position:0%
is going on
 
00:58:41.329 --> 00:58:41.339 align:start position:0%
and and in the case of dairy I've had
 
00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
several discussions with the leadership
 
00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
of the talent Administration
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
and they are they are very unhappy with
 
00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:53.780 align:start position:0%
the fact that the state has no uh has no
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
leverage in statute to
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
both license legitimate therapy massage
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
establishments and thereby to have a
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
means of going against these what I
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
could refer to as massage parlors which
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
are violating the current statute of
 
00:59:17.049 --> 00:59:17.059 align:start position:0%
health and safety conditions
 
00:59:17.059 --> 00:59:19.089 align:start position:0%
health and safety conditions
sanitation

00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:19.099 align:start position:0%
sanitation
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
food service and so forth in these
 
00:59:22.079 --> 00:59:23.049 align:start position:0%
food service and so forth in these
places

00:59:23.049 --> 00:59:23.059 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
they could do that but the police for
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
example are not at all interested
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
because it's just a misdemeanor uh the
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
the employees and the establishments uh
 
00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
get bailed out right away sent away
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
to other towns sometimes even the
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
management changes but the business goes
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
right before goes right forward and it's
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
just a cost of doing business for them
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
to pay the the uh the fines and so forth
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
for the misdemeanors so the police
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
really are not interested in pursuing
 
00:59:58.370 --> 00:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
this because it's basically a waste of
 
00:59:59.589 --> 00:59:59.599 align:start position:0%
their time
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
but the the proposed legislation would
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
give legitimate therapeutic massage
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
establishments uh some standing in some
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
places they're seen as equivalent or
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
similar to massage Partners which they
 
01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
are not so it's an insult to them to
 
01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:21.140 align:start position:0%
categorize them in that fashion
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
but that because of the clear fact that
 
01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
the massage parlors are not performing
 
01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:30.299 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage the employees are
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
not licensed they can't get licensed to
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
do therapeutic massage because they
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't have any training and that's not
 
01:00:38.049 --> 01:00:38.059 align:start position:0%
what they're doing
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
and so it would be an opportunity for
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
OPC to to begin to enforce
 
01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
simple standards which they're somewhat
 
01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
reluctant to do but after discussion
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
with the executive director and so forth
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
they recognize that this is you know a
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
viable means of taking some form of
 
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
action against these massage parlors so
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
I definitely think that any further
 
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
legislation is appropriate I mean I'm
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
sure if I may
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
the legislation merely
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
states that massage establishments will
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
be licensed this will give oplc the
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
authority to inspect
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
the businesses to see that the people
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
there are licensed and then and
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
therefore if there are issues that
 
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.430 align:start position:0%
therefore if there are issues that
require

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
further action the legislation says that
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
while the future legislation would say
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
that local authorities would be involved
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else have a comment
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair I I just
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
would like to point out that at
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
when we had the original hearing on this
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
bill it was really presented as this was
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
a local issue this was a local issue and
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a narrative that had
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
taken over in my opinion of that hearing
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
and then at our subcommittee hearing it
 
01:02:07.210 --> 01:02:07.220 align:start position:0%
was brought out
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
really brought to our attention that
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is actually a Statewide situation
 
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
it is not just a local issue and the
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
services that are being offered really
 
01:02:19.079 --> 01:02:20.809 align:start position:0%
services that are being offered really
are

01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
light licensed Services where that was
 
01:02:25.849 --> 01:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
not the case in what we found what was
 
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
really happening so I actually am am in
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
support after the the work session that
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
we had on it of future legislation thank
 
01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:35.150 align:start position:0%
we had on it of future legislation thank
you

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.530 align:start position:0%
you
okay

01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
I representative Bailey
 
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
my original concern was when we started
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
with all this was that this was kind of
 
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.589 align:start position:0%
with all this was that this was kind of
a

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
a licensure as law enforcement as
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to oversight of expertise and I
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything change really
 
01:02:58.089 --> 01:02:58.099 align:start position:0%
so I would not recommend this yes
 
01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
representative scitec based on my
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
experience in Salem which has had
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
exactly zero problems handling this
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
locally I'm going to vote against it for
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
that reason not because they shouldn't
 
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
be inspected but I think that it can
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to rep representative
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
and I have to agree with the last two
 
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.010 align:start position:0%
and I have to agree with the last two
speakers

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.250 align:start position:0%
speakers
um

01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:28.140 align:start position:0%
in many I don't see why all of the
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
hundreds of massage establishments in
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
the state need to be licensed because
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
some of the larger cities can't enforce
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
health and safety requirements on the
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
facilities in their towns and
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
as we as we heard Salem is not one of
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
them they have a local ordinance that
 
01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:50.819 align:start position:0%
they enforce and they don't have a
 
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
problem so I think that the if there is
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
further legislation needed it is more on
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
the lines of clarifying that localities
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
authority to license and inspect rather
 
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:06.530 align:start position:0%
authority to license and inspect rather
than

01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
having every place in the state
 
01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
contribute to helping a few towns
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
enforce their business
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
Madam chair are you referring to
 
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to allow local
 
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.569 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to allow local
municipalities

01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:23.339 align:start position:0%
to perform a function that is assumed to
 
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
be a state
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
no I'm
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
going to have
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
authorizing legislation to have
 
01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
localities enforce their health and
 
01:04:41.089 --> 01:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
safety requirements restaurant
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
which which is I what I believe to be
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
representative schuette thank you madam
 
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.049 align:start position:0%
representative schuette thank you madam
chair

01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:04:54.049 --> 01:04:54.059 align:start position:0%
um correct me if I'm wrong but don't the
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
localities technically have that right
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
now without
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
I would have thought so so what what
 
01:05:06.109 --> 01:05:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative on scitec right I was
 
01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
going to make a similar comment and I'm
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to vote against recommending
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislation unless uh you know somebody
 
01:05:17.569 --> 01:05:17.579 align:start position:0%
brings up
 
01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
evidence that dairy's operating
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
illegally or outside of their Authority
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
we have an existence proof that it can
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
be handled locally today and I don't
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
think there's a need for further
 
01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.289 align:start position:0%
think there's a need for further
legislation

01:05:29.289 --> 01:05:29.299 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh there is indeed I believe there is a
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
need for further legislation because
 
01:05:36.289 --> 01:05:36.299 align:start position:0%
when I talk to our health officers he
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
was tiptoeing around whether he really
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
had the authority to do this and it
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
would be awfully nice to have state law
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
permit him to do this so I'd like to see
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
something here and not just not
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
I'd like it done I'd like to enable
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
local the locals like they do
 
01:05:54.599 --> 01:05:55.970 align:start position:0%
local the locals like they do
restaurants

01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:55.980 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
nice to representative fellows thank you
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:02.540 align:start position:0%
um I have a recollection which could be
 
01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:06.299 align:start position:0%
inaccurate that last term we had a bill
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
that had to do with
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
um licensing massage establishments and
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
and but the bill that we had had
 
01:06:16.809 --> 01:06:16.819 align:start position:0%
something to do about
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
excluding those that were just a single
 
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.569 align:start position:0%
excluding those that were just a single
therapist

01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
did that pass or what I'm so I'm trying
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
to figure out what happened here
 
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:33.260 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it passed
 
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:37.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.569 --> 01:06:41.579 align:start position:0%
they couldn't have any hearings so no it
 
01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:46.130 align:start position:0%
they couldn't have any hearings so no it
died

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
so as yes as a follow-up
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee did they have any
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about that situation like if
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
we're going to license them or or they
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
did they discuss excluding those really
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
small one-person shops
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
those the bill that was submitted to our
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
original committee is the same as the
 
01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
one that was submitted originally and
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments or questions
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt thank you I'll
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
just further point out
 
01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:20.990 align:start position:0%
just further point out
um

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of committee members who
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
may not realize that even if this does
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
not get recommended anyone can put the
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
legislation in again as a matter of fact
 
01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
I've noticed that representative Broda
 
01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:35.220 align:start position:0%
has like an LSR already submitted that
 
01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
appears to address this issue
 
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:41.780 align:start position:0%
so I our recommendation is somewhat uh
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes it's a sense of the committee
 
01:07:52.609 --> 01:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
I would never let anyone on this
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
committee feel that they are toothless
 
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
or hopeless
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
no we will it it seems that there will
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
be some legislation which which after
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative Rhoda is happy with it
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
will come to us and get thoroughly
 
01:08:07.559 --> 01:08:12.829 align:start position:0%
will come to us and get thoroughly
mangled

01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
exactly representative that's exactly
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
all right any uh other comments
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
no okay in that case the motion is
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
recommended for further legislation and
 
01:08:30.289 --> 01:08:30.299 align:start position:0%
the clerk can call the Rollie
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%

01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%

01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
two four six eight to five in favor of
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
recommended all right
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
I'll if anyone wished to write a
 
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
Minority Report feel free
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
no appetite yeah I'm not going to all
 
01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:31.189 align:start position:0%
no appetite yeah I'm not going to all
right

01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
any does anyone else have a bill that
 
01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:36.299 align:start position:0%
they think we are through studying
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
well don't we have to get them all
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien no we we can't
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
get them all because at least one of
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
them representative Lucas's is yeah
 
01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
although actually you know what your
 
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.729 align:start position:0%
although actually you know what your
recommendations

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:48.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
chairman my question is through the
 
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
chair to uh representative scitec uh he
 
01:09:57.169 --> 01:09:57.179 align:start position:0%
did share the committee with the
 
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
building instructors inspectors are we
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
ready for that
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
do we make a decision on that
 
01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.470 align:start position:0%
do we make a decision on that
building

01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
duplexes yes I think that Madam chair I
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
think that was your bill it was my
 
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.669 align:start position:0%
think that was your bill it was my
abilius

01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:16.100 align:start position:0%
since I've already written the blurb
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
what's your recommendation
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay not recommended do I have a is is
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
there a second represent psychic
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
recommends not not recommended for
 
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:43.640 align:start position:0%
further legislation on House Bill 1191.
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien oh second seconds
 
01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.990 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien oh second seconds
okay

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
there is a good idea here but it's would
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
take a lot of work that I'm not willing
 
01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody else
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
well maybe someone else is but it seems
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
The Cure is
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
quite involved here uh you have the the
 
01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
I have a personal problem even with
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
doing work in your own house you have
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
your own family to contend with you
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't own them and if you're incompetent
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be allowed to do
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
electrical or gas work especially gas
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
worker electrical work you get you know
 
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.130 align:start position:0%
worker electrical work you get you know
uh

01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
so but I have putting that aside well
 
01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
can I put it aside it's it's part of the
 
01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:45.380 align:start position:0%
formulation of how I feel
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're doing work in somebody else in
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
the duplex you could affect your the
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
health and safe health and safety a
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
rubber stamp word uh of yourself or your
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
family that's in it by standards
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
bystanders to the work that's being done
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
in the duplex now
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
basically if you're competent I'm not
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
saying necessarily licensed I'm not sure
 
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
how you would handle a situation look
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
I'm competent to do this work
 
01:12:21.169 --> 01:12:21.179 align:start position:0%
meaning I know when I'm over my head I
 
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
stop I get the pros but I know I'm not
 
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
going to be cutting any gas pipes and
 
01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
letting the play that's just out of the
 
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
question all right
 
01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
so this is just simply too complicated
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
to uh to try to thread the needle of a
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
good solution
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
as written it should not go
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
can it be saved if someone wants to do a
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
lot of work I think it can be there's
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
something here as I said the path to
 
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
competence if not licensure
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
which should be true for anybody working
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
in any house
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
so I I it on the grounds that it's
 
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
simply too complicated to make it work
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
as written I'm going to not I'm going to
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
move I have moved that it's not not as
 
01:13:15.649 --> 01:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
in this form not be recommended for
 
01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:19.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh when
 
01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
representative seitzek when we held this
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
particular committee meetings one of the
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
representatives showed up whereas
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
members of the uh inspection services
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
for the individual communities and
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
currently right now state law basically
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
says if you live in a single-family home
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
a man's home is his castle so if if the
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
homeowner who lives in a single
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
occupancy decides to do this type of
 
01:13:51.530 --> 01:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
work uh could he in the worst case
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
scenario jeopardize his family yes but
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't inadvertently jeopardize
 
01:13:59.810 --> 01:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
what I would say the innocent and who
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
are the innocent I think when we go into
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
a situation and agree to pay rent such
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
as in the duplex or a multi-family home
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
we're at the whim in hopes and good
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
trust and good nature that the landlord
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
has done its due diligence and has done
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
the proper wiring and at the uh like
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
something as very simple as the uh hot
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
water system is properly vented and
 
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
everything else uh yes there is a need
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
and there is a lot of communities in the
 
01:14:34.729 --> 01:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that do not have
 
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
uh building inspectors and I can
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
understand uh the wants and needs of
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
this particular bill but in communities
 
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:44.780 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of rental
 
01:14:48.290 --> 01:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
occupancies uh we I felt that it did
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
need so therefore I supported the
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
committee what the recommendation not to
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
support this
 
01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.030 align:start position:0%
support this
okay

01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:57.709 --> 01:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
he's gonna block us
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
um you know well I support I supported
 
01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
the original bill I'll go along with the
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
not recommend further legislation
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't see
 
01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
it's likely any legislation I could
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
support coming out of it more than
 
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
anything else and just uh
 
01:15:15.169 --> 01:15:15.179 align:start position:0%
in response to the concerns about people
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
doing work on their own single-family
 
01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:18.290 align:start position:0%
doing work on their own single-family
home

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh the question is where do you draw the
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
line I mean does the government people
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
can do many things to endanger their
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
families from how they mow the lawn
 
01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
drive the car and raise their children
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
and I would not accept government making
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
decisions on competencies
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.970 align:start position:0%
 
sponsor

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
I've come to realize the bill was too
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
broad but I think we ought to be looking
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
very hard at the places where we say
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
doing Plumbing work without a license is
 
01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:54.290 align:start position:0%
doing Plumbing work without a license is
illegal

01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:57.260 align:start position:0%
because yes you don't want to have an
 
01:16:01.209 --> 01:16:01.219 align:start position:0%
inexperienced or unqualified person
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
designing a complete plumbing system but
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
replacing a sink
 
01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
there are a significant number of things
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
that fall under the plumbing code that
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
any reasonably handy person can do
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
safely and effectively and I think we
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking at the exemptions
 
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
rather than where they're being done
 
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
that's my my point but
 
01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
well that's terrific
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense okay
 
01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
all right any other comments
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I I'm hearing the
 
01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
likelihood of some legislation coming
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
forward and I'm just curious
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
um if there's some way that it can be
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
crafted to allow the board to make those
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
kinds of exceptions
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
just a thought yeah it's a thought
 
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900 align:start position:0%
but it depends on somebody willing to do
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
the work as representative sciteek said
 
01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.550 align:start position:0%
the work as representative sciteek said
and

01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a little I'm booked a little heavily
 
01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
this this year about letting the board
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
make those exceptions I think I would
 
01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
like to hear the board make
 
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations to us and we put them in
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
law because the recommendation may be
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
you may turn on and off the hot water
 
01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.910 align:start position:0%
you may turn on and off the hot water
faucet

01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
faucet
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I want to they have they may have a
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
vested interest in for keeping their
 
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
domain smaller than we might like
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a tough area because they
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
want competent people to be able to do
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
stuff like this but I also understand
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
the need for licensing even though I'm
 
01:17:46.130 --> 01:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
Wild West blah blah so this is a tough
 
01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.229 align:start position:0%
Wild West blah blah so this is a tough
area

01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:17:51.410 --> 01:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else
 
01:17:53.689 --> 01:17:53.699 align:start position:0%
represent blackis yeah I'm just torn on
 
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
how to vote because it's more a message
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
I guess that's being sent than anything
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
else at this point so I'll I'll make a
 
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:02.820 align:start position:0%
decision when I vote I guess it's coming
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%

have no recollection of what that is
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
in that case we don't want to discuss it
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
today can we I mean our recommendation
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
was not to recommend but I cannot
 
01:19:48.719 --> 01:19:51.050 align:start position:0%
was not to recommend but I cannot
remember

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%

01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:02.219 align:start position:0%
oh 230 is body art
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:10.620 align:start position:0%

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
to go back oh wait I that taste this is
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for oh no no can we
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
just put those two off until
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
we please put those two off until the
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
next time I promise I will be sharper
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay well I think that you probably
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
should be awake
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
yeah do I promise be way sharper
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so I don't think we have any
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
we should take up 1312 because we have
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
other bills that we can't take up
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
because the people aren't here so we
 
01:20:46.729 --> 01:20:46.739 align:start position:0%
will have to meet once more before the
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
end of the month
 
01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
that's October yeah
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
and we're meeting because we have other
 
01:20:54.770 --> 01:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
things to do not because I couldn't
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
remember no no there's okay thank you
 
01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.209 align:start position:0%
remember no no there's okay thank you
[Music]

01:20:59.209 --> 01:20:59.219 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
we have five other bills that we had
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
kept in interim study and we don't have
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
it have someone here to make a motion on
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
or and have someone ready to make a
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
motion on any of them yeah in 1312 we
 
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
have hopefully our last meeting on the
 
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
28th of this month so we're not ready
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
and I will State uh representative Marsh
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
told me he had another commitment this
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
morning I think he had indicated he was
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to write a statement on 1566
 
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
because the committee should be aware
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
another bill did pass with this but
