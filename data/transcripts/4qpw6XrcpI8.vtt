Mark toown uh I'm an attorney I'm a
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
freshman so this is my first year in the
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
house second year but first term in the
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
house um I practice family law and I
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
love this committee we have we we are
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
very collegial we have different points
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
of view um but we all get along and we
 
00:15:08.829 --> 00:15:08.839 align:start position:0%
hash out issues and I have found that
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
the process in the house is very very
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
Democratic with a small D so all bills
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
um that are introduced get a hearing in
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
whatever committee is relevant and then
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
they all get a vote in the committee and
 
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:26.720 align:start position:0%
then they all go to the floor and they
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
all get a a vote on the floor so it's
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
different from our federal system where
 
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:33.910 align:start position:0%
different from our federal system where
uh

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
Congress can the Speaker of the House
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
can control What legislation goes to the
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
floor here it's very it's very open and
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's very Democratic and I really enjoy
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%

from you thank you thank you so what I'd
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
like to do maybe just just very briefly
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
because I I want to make sure that the
 
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
the main thing we do is answer your
 
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
questions and talk about things that you
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
are interested in um uh and I know
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
you've already heard from me on Monday
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to let my colleagues do
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
most of the talking for us but just very
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
briefly uh to give you just a little bit
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
of background as representative Manos
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out um this is we are a somewhat
 
00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.350 align:start position:0%
pointed out um this is we are a somewhat
unique

00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
unique
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
um legislative body our government uh in
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is is is a little bit
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
different so to speak than the than the
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
typical government around the country
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
and so just as an example our governor
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
is elected for only two years um I think
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont does no Vermont changed didn't
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
they they are they now are four but we
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
are one of the few States we may be the
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
only state but if but there might be one
 
00:24:27.389 --> 00:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
or two other states that elect their
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
governor for only two years most States
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's four years um in addition to
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
that the go the governor is the head of
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
the executive branch of the government
 
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
but most of the leader most of the heads
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
of agencies that are under the executive
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
branch of the government have the heads
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
of those agencies are appointed for
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
terms of four or five years um so
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know that the governor doesn't the
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
governor doesn't have the same kind of
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
authority over the executive branch of
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
our government that the president of the
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
United States has over the executive
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
branch of the federal government our
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%
legislature as you as you may or may not
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
have heard we have 400 members of the of
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
This House of Representatives in a state
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
of about a million3 million 300,000
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
population so every one of us represents
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
about 3,800 3600 something like that
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
people so um we you know we are pretty
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
close so to speak to the to the people
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
now we have a pretty small Senate we
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
have there are 24 uh
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
Senators um uh which is you know that's
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
a big difference between the size of the
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
house in the size of the Senate uh and
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
we have the you we have the same system
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
of how laws are enacted as the federal
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
government in the sense that in order
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
for a for a uh law to be enacted it has
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
to be passed by both houses of the
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
legislature and then signed by the
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
governor or if the governor vetos it
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
then it has to be over the veto has to
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
be overridden by a two-thirds vote of
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
both houses so that's kind of similar to
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
the to the um federal government but um
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
as representative man has pointed out we
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh one big difference in our system is
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
that every bill that is that is proposed
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
by a
 
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative is assigned to a
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
committee and it gets a hearing even if
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
and you know candidly some bills are you
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
know really out there you know it's uh
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
you you you look at it and you say what
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
how but it gets a hearing
 
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:01.720 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the and even if it's you
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
know if the committee recommends against
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
it even if the committee recommends
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
unanimously against it it still goes to
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
the floor for a vote and you know if
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's a representative who wants to
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know make a a fight on the floor to
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
try to get the the body to pass it uh
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
they can do that so that um uh that
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
really is does make it a very sort of
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
democratic uh uh uh process um with that
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um I'm going to sort of
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
open it to you for do you have questions
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
we'd love to answer your questions and
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh and then if if my colleagues have
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
other things that they think are
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
important to talk about I'm I as I say
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
I'm you should be hearing from we want
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
to hear from you and from them as
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to from me thank you excuse me
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
you forgot to mention that we make a
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
$100 a year oh that's in Very Yes we get
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
a the for for the work we put in we are
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
paid $100 a
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
year which we which we we pay taxes on
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
so basically this is kind of volunteer
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
service um which you know there are some
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
good parts to that there really are um
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
on the other hand it tends to mean that
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people like myself
 
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
who are retired and who have the time or
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
who are business people and have the
 
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.669 align:start position:0%
who are business people and have the
time

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
um which which can tend to skew you know
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
how uh uh who the people are that serve
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
as Representatives um that that that
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
that that's unquestionably true I think
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
um so what can what what do you have for
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:59.470 align:start position:0%
 
which

00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
which are the most uh challenging
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
community I would have to say
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
that the general category of challenging
 
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.590 align:start position:0%
that the general category of challenging
bills

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
this term and many terms is
 
00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:38.120 align:start position:0%
education that is who
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
pays for for Education where the money
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
comes from and where the money
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
goes um there is a a movement
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
nationally um that is very real here in
 
00:29:54.159 --> 00:29:55.029 align:start position:0%
nationally um that is very real here in
New

00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to um
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
take money that was traditionally
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
focused in the public
 
00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
schools and understand that the schools
 
00:30:09.159 --> 00:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
schools and understand that the schools
are

00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
controlled by the cities and
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
towns and mo much of the money comes
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
from the cities and towns but the money
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
that the state puts in is very
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
important um the movement that is very
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
popular across the country now with not
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
with everyone but with some people is to
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
take that public
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
money and rechannel it not to the public
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
schools but to other entities whether
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
traditional schools or not that um of
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
parent might want to use to educate
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
their children and so they lots of
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
related issues with that the issues
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:06.039 align:start position:0%
curriculum although it you know when
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
they say it's not the money it always
 
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
comes down to money um but you know
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
there are other issues and I think
 
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.750 align:start position:0%
there are other issues and I think
that's

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
probably in many ways affects us across
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
many of our committees it's not the only
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
issue um and the issue that this
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
particular committee has been working on
 
00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
with a great deal of commitment trying
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
to find the right way would I I say come
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
into the general category of
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
transparency and
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
accountability um and uh and that
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
affects as you can well imagine every
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
aspect of government and significant um
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
aspects in the private sector so those
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
be the the two areas I would think
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
mention most I'm sure other people have
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry repes oh thank you um I
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to agree that I think uh that the
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts are probably
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
the most contentious issue this term um
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
there have been others in the past and
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
we have a different perspective so I
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
wanted that's why I asked to speak
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
because I the conservative side and um
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
the way we see it is all right the
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
average cost for per student in New
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is $220,000 a year per
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
student uh the less students in the
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
school means less taxpayers money
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
spending on us so if it cost $20,000 to
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
to educate one child if they're using
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts it's
 
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
$5,000 so there's $155,000 savings so
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
it's just a matter of of your
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
perspective and
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
um I I support the efas you know can can
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
I just ask you ask could could some of
 
00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
you one or more of you I mean I wonder
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
if you could just tell us one of the
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
things that is happening in New
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think in many other
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
states in the United States is that our
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
student population is
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
dropping in other words we've we've had
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
like a 15 or 20% maybe it's even more
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
than that decline in our in the number
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
of students that attend school in New
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over say the last 15 years or
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
so is that is that kind of trend true in
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
your countries
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.080 --> 00:33:56.070 align:start position:0%
 
isn't

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
right you're the number of schoolage
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
children has that is that going
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
up that's what I would have thought and
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
I think that's true in other countries
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
too is it true in The Gambia yeah
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
Albania and what's happening in Kosovo
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
where you you have
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
age on that same subject
 
00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
um I was put here by parents um during
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
covid um a a lot of parents were very
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
upset about what was going on in our
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
schools as far as their children being
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
Master you know um things going on so I
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a retired nurse I had no intentions
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
of being a state representative but
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
because I spoke at school meetings
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
parents put me here and I think one of
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
the things that our freedom accounts
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
allow is um one one shop does not make
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
it for everybody one it's some kids just
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
you may live in a town but that
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
particular School is not what you may
 
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
need and does not offer what you may
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
need as an individual and I think that
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
is one of the biggest driving SP forces
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
and um to have children be available to
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
go to other schools for example if you
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
have a school that is not offering
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
anything in the trades at all then
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps it is better for them to be able
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
to utilize um State money we also have a
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
lot of of charter schools in this state
 
00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
and they're going up like crazy and they
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
get they're public but they get a very
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
limited amount of money so I happen to
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
have been at a fundraiser for one on
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
Saturday night so there's a lot of
 
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:14.200 align:start position:0%
Parental involvement so there's a lot
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
more to it than it's a it's a lot of
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
things so representative trip and then
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative page the uh I can't
 
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
remember who who said that uh the
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
schools are controlled by the uh the
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
towns I I think that's something of a
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
misnomer because uh as is always happens
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
we have uh we have well in in uh in New
 
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have school boards uh
 
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
people who are locally elected to uh uh
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
oversee the schools but uh for the most
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
part we have uh administrators
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats who actually run the schools
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
and uh uh there's there's some
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
discussion about how the schools are
 
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
being run you know by uh as
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative Perez said that uh there
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
are parents that uh are not uh in
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
agreement with the how the schools are
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
being run so so that's that's something
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
of a uh a discussion that's going on in
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
the state right now uh you know the uh
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
the school boards they have uh
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
three-year terms and uh their basic
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility is is to
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh hire the superintendent which is the
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
the highest uh position in the schools
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
and to set policies you know so
 
00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh some of the policies that they set
 
00:37:44.589 --> 00:37:44.599 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh agreed to by the parents and the the
 
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
residents in the town so like like most
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
places there's a as I said some heated
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
discussion that goes
 
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
discussion that goes
on

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
I hi I have a question for you all um
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
and I'll just reflect on how the
 
00:38:05.069 --> 00:38:05.079 align:start position:0%
governance structure of public education
 
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
is in the United States we have this
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
weird mix of every state has a duty to
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
provide a free education to every
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
student and some have said that's kind
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
of a crown jewel of of America is that
 
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
we do that all take all cers um but at
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
the same time the federal government
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
funds about 10% of a bud so we have this
 
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
weird mix and the local towns that we
 
00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
cities that we represent raise property
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
taxes to fund that model and the state
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
has other means to do that so there's
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
all these sort of mix of governmental uh
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
levels and I'm just curious who's in
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
charge uh is it is it is it that
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
complicated and and messy or is there
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
who's in charge of of education for a
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
public if if there is such thing um in
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
your place in wherever s countries that
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
you're coming com from
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
yeah got to start from some place yeah
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
um in my country I come from
 
00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
Romania uh in my country it's a mix of
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
public and private
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
schools uh as far as public schools are
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
concerned then again you have a mix of
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh the uh state run schools and local
 
00:39:19.309 --> 00:39:19.319 align:start position:0%
schools most of the schools are owned by
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
the local government so uh even though
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
they get budgetary allowances from the
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
national budget the way they administer
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
the funds it's up to the local community
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
and up to the local government um so uh
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
from this point of view it can be a bit
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
challenging because the overseeing power
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the national Ministry of
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
Education uh is not that is not enough
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the funds are spent in
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
a way that that would comply with the
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
national policy on education because the
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
schools have a a very large Mandate of
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
of uh dealing with their own funds and
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
the local government has again a lot of
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
leeway uh on the way they spend their
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
their budget but most of it comes from
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.309 --> 00:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
budget could I ask a question um how are
 
00:40:15.319 --> 00:40:16.510 align:start position:0%
budget could I ask a question um how are
your

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
judges selected are they elected are
 
00:40:21.359 --> 00:40:22.670 align:start position:0%
judges selected are they elected are
they

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.349 align:start position:0%
they
appointed

00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
um you again yeah because in this case
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
now this is a question that gets an
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
easier answer from the point of view of
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
European States because we have to apply
 
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
Council of Europe standards uh so more
 
00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:38.599 align:start position:0%
or less in Europe you you're going to
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
have the same system uh everywhere
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
meaning that you get a Judicial Council
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
which it may vary by name from country
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
to country but nevertheless you get
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
something which is called the judicial
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
Council usually composed mostly of
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
Judges there there can be uh uh members
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
which are not part of the Judiciary but
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
usually they are in minority as compared
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
to judges one of the principles we have
 
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
uh stemming from the Council of Europe
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
conventions uh is that the Judiciary
 
00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:11.079 align:start position:0%
body should self-regulate as much as
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
possible uh meaning also that they're in
 
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
charge of their own career for judges
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
and prosecutors so you're going to have
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
this body usually um making appointments
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
for judges and then it goes to the head
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
of state but this is usually just a
 
00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.150 align:start position:0%
of state but this is usually just a
formality

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
formality
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
uh usually it's the head of state that
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
uh signs the official document
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
appointing a judge to his or her
 
00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
position but again usually uh in Romania
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
certainly that is the case the president
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
of the country cannot refuse a
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
nomination coming from judicial
 
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
Council um because one of the principles
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
that we have again stemming from the
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
Council of Europe conventions is to
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
limit as much as possible the
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
involvement of the executive power in
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
the running of the Judiciary
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
that's in short so you must be amused to
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
watch us um with in terms of our United
 
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court appointments you
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%
don't have to comment I'm just you know
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
I know you're going to be polite about
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
that um are there terms uh or are or
 
00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
judges um selected for Life For Life
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
most of the time and is there um uh a
 
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
senior age cut off that's a a very a
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
very delicate subject because sitting at
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
this table is someone who had to leave
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
the court that he loved um when he
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
reached 70 and we now are trying to um
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh amend the Constitution to raise that
 
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.710 align:start position:0%
uh amend the Constitution to raise that
to

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:48.200 align:start position:0%
75 in his honor so what
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
um what uh is there an age cut off that
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
depends um it could be 60 65 70 depends
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
y The Gambia The
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
Gambia okay so um our retirement age for
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
judges is 75 in The Gambia um it it was
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
not over 75 it was 65 so um there was a
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to change the
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
age from 65 to 75 that is the mandatory
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
retirement but they still have the
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
option to retire at the age of 65 so I
 
00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted talk about like the
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
selection process for judges in my
 
00:43:33.109 --> 00:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
country we have the Judicial Service
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
Commission that is that comprises the
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice uh the whole process is
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
judiciary LED so it has nothing to do
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
with the executive or the legislature so
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
the the the chairperson of the
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
commission is the Chief Justice and then
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
there is another judge of the Supreme
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
Court and then there is a nomination
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
from the executive and the legislature
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
and then a senior member of the bar and
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
another lay person it could be a retired
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
civil servant or any other person so
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
that is how judges are selected and
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
those people would recommend would have
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
a pool of people and then um select a
 
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
suitable person for the position of a
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
judge and then send the name to the
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
president so as in other countries in
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
Europe the president would just sign the
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
appointment so the
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
President appoints under the
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the Judicial Service
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
Commission so it's very strange that
 
00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
when we come here the process is
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
completely different and um in my
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
country it's solely Judiciary L um
 
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.829 align:start position:0%
country it's solely Judiciary L um
process

00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:38.839 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
and it's interesting do you have any
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
questions yeah you know what I wonder if
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
this is really a question I've just
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
asked to EV to to all of you it's from
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
from what the discussion we had on
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
Monday it it it sounds like at least in
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
many of your countries that there is a
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
a closer for for lack of a better term a
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
closer relationship
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
between the prosecutorial authorities
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
and the court than is true than is true
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
here in other words I if I understood
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
correctly many um in in some of your
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
countries I think there is
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
a the training is sort of the same for
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
both is that true no for that is the
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
civil law system there is that closer
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
relationship in the civil law system
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
but in my country it's a common law
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
country so there is a complete
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
separation between the prosecution and
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary so in my country the
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
prosecution is under the executive which
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
is the we have the Attorney General we
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't have we have the attorney general
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
who occupies both position of Minister
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
of Justice and also attorney general so
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
he is under the executive he or she is
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
under the executive so um the Judiciary
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
is completely different it's this
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
another arm of government and the
 
00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
executive is under the Attorney General
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
office is under the executive and that's
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
where you have all the State Law
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
Officers and the
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:13.480 align:start position:0%
please in the civil law tradition uh the
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
prosecution office is uh is an
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
independent body and is attached to the
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary so uh our prosecution office
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
is organized like the Judiciary they
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
have a high uh High Council of uh for
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutors which is organized like the
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
high judicial Council and they have uh
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
the same Independence as the judges we
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
are regulated uh within the same bill
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
which called the law on the status of
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
judges and prosecutors so we have uh the
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
the same Arrangements uh judges and
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
prosecution and we attend the same uh
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
the same formation the same school all
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
of us have to
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh to have a low degree and then to uh
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
follow the formation uh in the school of
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
magistrates great thank you so you other
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
qu what I'm sorry yes go ahead please U
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
ju just a quick question uh our friend
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
from Albania a few minutes ago said that
 
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
they're losing some of their students to
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
immigration and my question is are you
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
concerned about your
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
long-term losses of these students that
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
you might be losing some of the best
 
00:47:28.349 --> 00:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
Minds in the country and how it's going
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
to affect government uh science
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
technology and and business in the
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
future yeah uh I think it's it's a big
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
problem not only for Albania but for the
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
whole balans and uh I'm not sure what's
 
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
what our government is uh is doing to to
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
improve uh this
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
situation uh it has our prime minister
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%

process I I don't have any any stri
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
straight Ahad answer for that question
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry thank you so other uh other
 
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
yes hi uh so uh we uh visited several
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
Institution when we after we came here
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
so one of the institutions we visited is
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
public defenders office so in public
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
defenders office we heard that uh the
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
death penalty is abolished in the state
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and we heard that but still
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
there is one person who's in the death
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
row yes so uh then we heard that uh it
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
is the law is not
 
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.710 align:start position:0%
is the law is not
retrospective

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
retrospective
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
and right that's that that's true there
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
is one person who has been who was
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
convicted and sentenced to death before
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
the law changed and the law that changed
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know that that abolished the death
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
penalty specifically says it is not it
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
applies prospectively only only for the
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
future not for the past yeah so I don't
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
know whether you will uh able to answer
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
this question yeah um so in my
 
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
perspective or if I think from a human
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
rights perspective then uh if the the
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
state is already taken a policy decision
 
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
to abolish it uh uh like the person
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
who's in the death row also maybe should
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
have that benefit of that because
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
already that policy decision is taken so
 
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:50.799 align:start position:0%
are there like any uh other uh
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that the commission
 
00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
judicial commission or other ways yeah
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
so I I I I be if I'd be interested if
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
any of my colleagues comment I what I
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
would say is my understanding
 
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.670 align:start position:0%
would say is my understanding
is

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
that basically that's an I mean it's a
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
very interesting question uh there have
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
been C there are states around the
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
country where a somewhat where a similar
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
thing uh
 
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
happened uh you know a similar sort of
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
I think Connecticut is the one that
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
comes to mind but I think there may be
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
others and in which the Supreme Court of
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
that state said well even though the
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
statute said it's only perspective you
 
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
can't apply it you can't execute someone
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
you know even if they were convicted
 
00:50:47.359 --> 00:50:48.990 align:start position:0%
you know even if they were convicted
before

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that I don't know if
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
there are if there are states that have
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
reached the opposite conclusion but it
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
it is is a you know it is an open
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
question I you there are there are
 
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
legitimate arguments on both sides of
 
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
that question I think and so my my
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
perspective and I'm not involved in this
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
at all anymore but my perspective is
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
that nobody wants to do anything every
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
you know in other words nobody's moving
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
the the the Attorney General's office is
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
not moving forward to try to execute the
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
person he remains in
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
jail um
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
and uh and you know there's
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
no at least as far as I know I and I
 
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
think there would probably be some
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
public you know something would be in
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
the newspaper if something nothing
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
really is happening it's just
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
everybody's kind of saying you know
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
let's just let's just leave this alone
 
00:51:48.789 --> 00:51:48.799 align:start position:0%
that that's my perspective and I'd be
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
interested if anybody has any other
 
00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
perspective I think um I think I agree
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
with um what I know I agree with what
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
the chair says um the person we're
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
talking about was
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
convicted um of um killing a police
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
officer and um
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
if the the
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
bill that eliminated n Hampshire's death
 
00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
penalty was not prospective in other
 
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
words was not limited in that way it
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
would not have
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
passed uh and I think the dis for those
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
of us who had the opportunity to vote on
 
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
that I think the fact that it was
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
prospective made it possible for the
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
legislation to pass and it was important
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
to many of us that it
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
passed so in this as in virtually
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
everything the world is not perfect I
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
hope that doesn't surprise you you might
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
think the world is perfect but it's
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
not and so that was the price that was
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
paid that it would not be retrospective
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
that it would not not include this one
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
person if I had to
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
guess I would think the most likely
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
thing will H that would happen is
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
nothing the second most likely thing way
 
00:53:46.109 --> 00:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
down the
 
00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:52.839 align:start position:0%
list is that he would stay where he is
 
00:53:58.030 --> 00:53:58.040 align:start position:0%
until he dies a natural death
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
I think the third
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
option of making this retrospective is
 
00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.950 align:start position:0%
option of making this retrospective is
highly

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
highly
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
unlikely um and so we have a
 
00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.950 align:start position:0%
unlikely um and so we have a
situation

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
where one could
 
00:54:20.829 --> 00:54:20.839 align:start position:0%
say that one person is being
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
Deni protection under the
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
law and
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's and that's the way it is um this
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
is not a time to
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
discuss I don't think you
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
know whether he should be executed or
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
not executed we're talking here just
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
about the situation of the law but
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right that it is
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
um it's not a
 
00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.710 align:start position:0%
um it's not a
clear

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
situation one of the related issues that
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'd be curious about what happens in
 
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.829 align:start position:0%
I'd be curious about what happens in
your

00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
country um has to do with
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability on the
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
part of the government so that the
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
citizens of the
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
country might have an idea of what the
 
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.990 align:start position:0%
country might have an idea of what the
government's

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
government's
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
doing but we also have laws which
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
protect um uh police
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
um potential
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
punishments or trials and punishments
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
that nonp police officers would be
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
subjected to um they have an additional
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
protection than other citizens have is
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
any of that does any of that sound
 
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
familiar in terms of how things work in
 
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.390 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
interesting so other other questions
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
please well if I'm sorry do somebody
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
have a question or all right represent
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
of CH then
 
00:56:17.109 --> 00:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
please yeah thanks um I just sort of an
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
observation maybe more than a question
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
um and it's related to sort of like what
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
I see as the sort of uniqueness of this
 
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:26.870 align:start position:0%
I see as the sort of uniqueness of this
committee

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
um it's a Judiciary Committee so it
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
obviously relates to you know our court
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
systems and and such um but a lot of the
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
issues and the bills that come come
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
before us are things that relate to what
 
00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
I would call rights sort of the basic
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
you know human rights um bodily autonomy
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
you know questions of birth questions of
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
death questions of you know a lot of the
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
bills that we get are a lot less
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
concrete I would say than maybe some of
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
the other committees in the house
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
because there are sort of focused on
 
00:57:02.109 --> 00:57:02.119 align:start position:0%
these sort of more um I hate to use the
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
word nebulous but maybe you know
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
Concepts that are harder to Define um
 
00:57:10.109 --> 00:57:10.119 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of back and forth I
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
think about what the role of the
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
government and legislature is in these
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's the role of the government
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
to Grant and establish these rights or
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
the role of the government to um
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
restrict or in some way control these
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
rights um so
 
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:28.359 align:start position:0%
it kind of goes back to your first
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
question which is what are the most
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
contentious issues and it it in my mind
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's sort of the most contentious issues
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
maybe should be the ones that come here
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
I will say you know and you may have
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
picked this up that we've managed to
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
work through those in in a very
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
collaborative collegial way most of the
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
bills that come out of here we we agree
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
on um but um I don't know if there's
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
time left but any any thoughts about
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
sort of the way that your governments
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
interact with sort of the these
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
questions of of um you know under
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
thought usual Eric you asked a question
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
that just stopped us
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
all um but on the other side of that I
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
would add there other issues that are
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
very grounded that we're involved with
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
here for example landlord tenant
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
issues um the rights of landlords and
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
the rights of tenants and where is the
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
line between the two and if any of your
 
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
countries have figured out where that
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
line is do let us know because we
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
haven't figured it out
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
yet the other issue that um uh you rais
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
it you raised the question of
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
contentious issues the other issue that
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
we've we've dealt with um and it's it's
 
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
sort of beyond for this term anyway it's
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's in the past is the issue of
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
abortion um we had you know we had a
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
number of abortion bills and we had uh
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
um we we had uh debate and discussion
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
about those we we didn't all agree on on
 
00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh on on all of them but we agreed on
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
some of them and uh that and those went
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
to the floor and there was a you know a
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
debate a heavy debate on the floor
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
regarding those bills and uh but that's
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
a uh that's uh you know that was that
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
was a contentious issue and I'm just
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
wondering is that you know is that an
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
issue in any of your countries it's uh
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
of that's you know subject to uh dis
 
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:45.039 align:start position:0%
dispute or anything like that
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
yes in The Gambia we have a draft
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution that is still pending in
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
the the house
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
because uh we we drafted the law in 2017
 
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
18 to 19 so in 2020 it was introduced in
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
the National Assembly and it was
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
rejected because um the opposition party
 
01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:11.240 align:start position:0%
were of the view that the so the
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
president started his time before the
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
law was
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
introduced so and then in the draft
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution they were introducing term
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
limits before in our current
 
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution there are no time limits so
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
the draft
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution has two terms for the
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
president so the contentious issue was
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
the president was serving his first ter
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
and even if the Constitution is passed
 
01:00:41.430 --> 01:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
he would have only one term so that
 
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
would be like two terms so the president
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
and uh his party said no we're not going
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
to do it so when the Constitution got to
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
the National
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
Assembly it was the con contentious
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
issues and that was one of because the
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
president's Party formed the majority in
 
01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason why the that was
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
the only reason why the Constitution was
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
not passed I it's still pending all
 
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:11.029 align:start position:0%
not passed I it's still pending all
right

01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
yes a gentleman just walked in and if he
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
would stand up um I would like you to
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
see that he pass on his jacket an orange
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
that badge shows that he is a lobbyist
 
01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
he is here um to watch what we do and to
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
having tried to influence us to support
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
um his client's views and as you walk
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
through the State House complex in these
 
01:01:51.549 --> 01:01:51.559 align:start position:0%
next few hours you will see people with
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
orange Badges and they're really lovely
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
people you don't have to avoid them them
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know they're not
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
contagious um you might agree with them
 
01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
you might not but in this house because
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have we have very few staff
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
people we frequently depend upon
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
lobbyists to help give us background
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
information or help outline what the
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
issues are and the good lobbyists are
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
the ones who will tell us both sides of
 
01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
the issue and you learn very soon who
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
are the good lobbyist who you can trust
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
who's going to tell you the truth as
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
against those who spin who just tell you
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
theirs but they are a very important
 
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.480 align:start position:0%

bills today and I was able to see this
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
as well last week and one thing that I
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
saw about this committee was that was
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
really agreeable and that we were able
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
to get done or I watched them be able to
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
get done at least
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
um was like with the AI bill with in
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
regards to artificial
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
intelligence um so to leave you guys
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
able to with the committee and also
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
along with spreading across um three
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
other committees that had AI bills we
 
01:03:46.269 --> 01:03:46.279 align:start position:0%
realized there was not a an official
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
definition in the law for that and um so
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
that has been worked on and we are like
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
voting on that today so um it was that's
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
something that I watched um within a
 
01:03:59.630 --> 01:03:59.640 align:start position:0%

that this committee kind of sets the uh
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%

01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
I can't think of any kind
 
01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
I can't think of any kind
of

01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
AR

01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.440 --> 01:23:23.430 align:start position:0%

01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.440 --> 01:24:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
all right so um I'd like to uh call uh
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
the executive session of the Judiciary
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
Committee to order and I'd ask you
 
01:24:23.629 --> 01:24:23.639 align:start position:0%
please uh first to join me in the Pledge
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
Justice all right
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
um so I guess uh I call the uh executive
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
session to order and the first bill that
 
01:25:02.229 --> 01:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
1082 um and I guess I would uh recognize
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative tur to uh uh to speak to
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
that uh yeah thank thank you um chair uh
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
so I I distributed the um the amendment
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
to the bill uh both by email and sorry
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
sorry it's it's a Amendment
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
1060 yeah um and this is this is
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
actually a combination of two amendments
 
01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
um one that came from our original
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
hearing um which is sort of the
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
modifications of the the the upper
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill which really was
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
just restructuring a sentence from the
 
01:25:46.669 --> 01:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
original bill to make it clearer uh
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
which uh entities within the
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
organization uh did or did not have to
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
be qualified um people within the
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
profession um and then the the low the
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
latter part of it is sort of why we
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
formed the subcommittee for this bill
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
which was questions around the
 
01:26:04.679 --> 01:26:06.390 align:start position:0%
which was questions around the
interactions

01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
interactions
 
01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.070 align:start position:0%
interactions
between

01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
the the corporate entity that this uh
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
affects and the profession that the
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
corporate entity exists within um
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
basically needing to clarify two things
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
one is that the person serving in this
 
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
assistant manager role because they're
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
not a a qualified
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
individual uh that they cannot exercise
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
any professional judgment or render any
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
Professional Services while they're
 
01:26:41.590 --> 01:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
serving in that capacity um and then and
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
then the other um piece of it was to
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
clarify because this came up with um uh
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
some some guidance that that
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Manos uh brought for us
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
from the bar association I believe which
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
basically speaks about what a single
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
member legal practice uh should do when
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
the member dies or becomes
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
incapacitated um and when we looked at
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
them they weren't inherently in conflict
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
with each other um but they it certainly
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
was worth clarifying that what we're
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do here wouldn't override the
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
guidance of the profession in terms of
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
what they do because the the legal
 
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
profession because because they're uh
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
they they're governed by the Supreme
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
Court they have to basically appear um
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know before a judge to do some of
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
the things that were trying to say the
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
the at least the clinical professions is
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
where I got a lot of insights from don't
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to do um I will say we
 
01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh I I spoke just before this and I
 
01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
hadn't had a chance even to talk to
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
representative Ming following our our uh
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
our our subcommittee meeting but I did
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
get in touch with the ass uh assistant
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State this morning um she
 
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
basically said they haven't had a time
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
to look at this in depth um they don't
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
see any problems with it on the surface
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
um they said basically it may be um some
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
issues around modifying reporting forms
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
for corporations that are or plc's that
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
are in this situation going forward so
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's clear sort of how they're operating
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
um so basically they said they they
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
won't be able to really complete that
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
until the end of the week but they said
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
you know it's okay from their
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
perspective to to go forward um there's
 
01:28:35.229 --> 01:28:35.239 align:start position:0%
no red flags at the moment and then you
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
know if anything comes up it it may
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
require us to you know look at an
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
amendment uh on the floor or an
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
amendment through senate or something so
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
um the the clinical professions didn't
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
raise any issues we talked to the um
 
01:28:51.870 --> 01:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
talked to the medical society they
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
checked with um oplc licensing um
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
Authority for across everyone and they
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
didn't raise any any issues so so that's
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does um sorry I
 
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
should have said my my I don't know if
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to start within a a motion
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
well you probably you probably should
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
probably should have started with that's
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
all right so my so so my motion would be
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and I'm introducing
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh
 
01:29:19.149 --> 01:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
1060 um in in regards to what I just
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
spoke about all right and is there a
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
second rep represent
 
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.590 align:start position:0%
second rep represent
Manis

01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay well you know before we do that is
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
there a second to the
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
motion I'll second the motion thank you
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
all right so Mo motion's been moved and
 
01:29:37.390 --> 01:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
seconded um and representative Mana
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I as an attorney I
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
do have concerns about the ethical
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
implications of the
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
amendment um I did reach out to the bar
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
association I did ask that they provide
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
guidance from the Ethics Committee
 
01:29:58.990 --> 01:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
because of the shortness of time
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
involved they weren't able to do that I
 
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
believe representative Ming also was
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
interested in hearing from an attorney
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
who practices in the area of business
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
entity formation but I my view at this
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
point is that we should pass the
 
01:30:20.189 --> 01:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
amendment um have it go to the floor and
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
there would be time in the Senate
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
assuming the house passes it there would
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
be time in the Senate to hear from the
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee of the bar association
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
and an attorney who practices business
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
entity law and um if there are problems
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
at that point we can amend the bill
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
again other anyone else wish to be heard
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ming and then
 
01:30:41.679 --> 01:30:43.149 align:start position:0%
uh representative Ming and then
representative

01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
Oregon yeah I just want uh thank you Mr
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
chair um I just wanted to say that I I I
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
do second what representative Mano said
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
um about my concerns initially for this
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a good sign that the
 
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office gave a kind
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
of cursory um thumbs up um so thank you
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
representative tur for doing that uh for
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
looking into it so um I I'm in agreement
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
with um representative Manos um I think
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
we should pass this amendment and um
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
pass the Bill great thank you
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon um I mean I think
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
the language here is sufficient for this
 
01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
situation by warning about the situation
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
where the assistant man manager is not a
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
qualified person but they're in the
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
process of trying to become one let's
 
01:31:31.950 --> 01:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
say I'll pick on him probably isn't fair
 
01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
to pick on him because he's not here
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
today but let's say rep let's say I was
 
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
a lawyer which thankfully I am not a
 
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
lawyer but if I was what if I had a law
 
01:31:43.109 --> 01:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
practice and I had uh representative
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
Kenny here as my assistant manager and
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
he was doing that while also studying
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
for his bar exam which hopefully he'll
 
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
be passing uh later this year so like
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
what if so if you have a situation like
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
that where the assistant man manager
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
isn't qualified at the time that the
 
01:31:58.430 --> 01:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
vacancy occurs but then becomes one
 
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
um representative tur well I'm sorry
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
representative tur and then
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative Perez yeah at my
 
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
understanding or I think the intent at
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
least of of the bill is that um you know
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
if that person was appointed as the
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
assistant manager they could basically
 
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
operate the business you know uh it
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't require that they not be a
 
01:32:31.229 --> 01:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
member of the profession just says they
 
01:32:34.189 --> 01:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
don't have to be one so essentially they
 
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding would be they could
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
serve in that capacity and then you know
 
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't know what the process
 
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
would be to sort of become the the
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
actual manager going forward but I don't
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
think anything would be precluded by it
 
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
unless someone has a different
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
opinion repres representative Perez
 
01:32:57.510 --> 01:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
I have two questions um becoming a
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
disqualified person does that mean if
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
you fire them that would fall under this
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
no so disqualified and qualified is sort
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
of the language about whether or not
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
you're you're uh qualified under the the
 
01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
professional lure so it would be like
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
being disbarred or being you know having
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
your license revoked or suspended that
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
followup yes
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
so if someone's terminated for any
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
reason this doesn't cover
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
it remember I was a nurse not a lawyer
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
so terminated as an employee of the
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
practice so as a manager I mean could so
 
01:33:42.270 --> 01:33:42.280 align:start position:0%
so they they're the directors of the
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
corporation so my second question is why
 
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:47.560 align:start position:0%
would we want I don't understand quite
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
the rationale between for passing this
 
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
and then amending it in the sent Senate
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
I don't think I've heard us doing that I
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not saying it isn't done but I
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
don't think I've heard us doing that in
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
my short time here doing
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
that well I guess I would say to that I
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
mean I I think you're right in the sense
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we you know we we it we don't
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
generally do that but I but but it's not
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
I I've I've heard a number of times in
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
connection with legislation both in this
 
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
committee and and in other committees
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
that you know if there's some sort of
 
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
minor issue it'll you know we'll it'll
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
it'll the Senate will fix it or whatever
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
and so you know don't hold up the
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
legislation but I have to say me and I
 
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
very I appreciate representative Manis
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
Ming's um concerns but you know as I
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
look at this I really think that the
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
language here is I'm going to be very
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
surprised if there's any if there's any
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
concerns because it says very clearly in
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
this in the in this amendment the
 
01:34:55.390 --> 01:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
non-quality ified person can't do
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
anything that requires qualification so
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
the you know the I think in
 
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
representative Oregan to use your
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
example I think if representative Kenny
 
01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
were to think oh you know I'm I'm taking
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
the bar exam tomorrow and I really know
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
all the law and it's okay for me to sort
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
of counil you know some uh some uh
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
client of the of the now deceased
 
01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers firm uh representative Kenny is
 
01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
going to have some real
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
problems um so I think you know my sense
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
is that this does address the the issue
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
pretty clearly I mean it's you know and
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
it says it really sort of more than once
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
um if if you're not if you're not a
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
licensed lawyer you can't do anything
 
01:35:46.189 --> 01:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
that amounts to practicing law if you're
 
01:35:48.550 --> 01:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
not a licensed doctor you can't do
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
anything that amounts to practicing
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
medicine then so I'm I'm you know I I am
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
satisfied that the language is good
 
01:35:59.790 --> 01:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
um uh yes representative D Lorenzo thank
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I just need to um air my
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
feelings about this and I am I don't
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
know if I'm totally comfortable um with
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
moving forward with this bill when there
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
are issues that aren't that haven't been
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
settled um one is the ethics issue um by
 
01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
the barer Association that um
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative mayos uh mentioned and
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
then the other one is um the SOS giving
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
sort of like thumbs up on the Bell so
 
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's just my opinion um I'd like to
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
see all the loops all the loops closed
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
but um that wouldn't prevent me from
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
voting going forward thank any other
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr chair uh just one
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
further um comment uh I brought this up
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee hearing and um I
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that this is not just
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
um an eth
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just an ethical concern for me
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
it was the fact that these there are
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
business entity options and a lot of
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
them uh in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
and they can range from small
 
01:37:09.149 --> 01:37:09.159 align:start position:0%
corporations big corporations
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
Partnerships all of all different types
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
llc's um limited liability Partnerships
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
um so to kind of upend what has
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
traditionally been done for PL
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
I without hearing from an expert that's
 
01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
that's what my main concern was that we
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
are changing something that is not
 
01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
captured in this bill in this amendment
 
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
and we're changing something about the
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
law that we we are unsure of um but I am
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
relying on the Secretary of State's
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
office knowing their stuff about this
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
and um and I will still support the Bill
 
01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other comments
 
01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew I'm sorry thank
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair do we have to exact this
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
bill today or can we wait for our
 
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
answers I think we have don't we have to
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.589 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
second it's not crossover it's when is
 
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
March 20 last day to report house bills
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
not in the second committee is March
 
01:38:35.550 --> 01:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
21st right so I really think this is
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is it yeah that's what that was my
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
concern is that we really um and you
 
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
know can I just can I just follow
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
represent I guess the thing I'm not I
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
mean other than
 
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
the other than the implications
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
of someone professional
 
01:38:55.870 --> 01:38:55.880 align:start position:0%
practicing that they're not you know
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
when they're not licensed to practice
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
which I think this addresses I'm not I'm
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
not sure I'm following the other in
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
other words what what are the other
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
things that you see would be a problem
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
that's I'm having trouble understanding
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
what those would be uh thank you for the
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
question um I I think this is a case of
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
we we kind of don't know what we don't
 
01:39:21.709 --> 01:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
know um and I I don't
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
think the pl was created for just for
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
fun you know it was it was created for a
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
reason and I'm not sure what that reason
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
is and I we we haven't exactly heard a
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
professional say what that reason is um
 
01:39:37.229 --> 01:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
because there are llc's and there are
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
plc's and in some states you can there
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
there are professionals that are
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
licensed that are not permitted to form
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
llc's and I don't know if that is the
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
case in New Hampshire and I I don't
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
practice business entity law in New
 
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I don't know the answer to
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
that question um and that that that is
 
01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
my main concern okay I you know I mean I
 
01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:05.239 align:start position:0%
guess what I it it would seem to me I I
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't profess to be an expert in
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
this area either but it would seem to me
 
01:40:13.149 --> 01:40:13.159 align:start position:0%
that the that the reason we
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
LLC differences from regular LLC is that
 
01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's a there's with PC's you want
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the that the uh a member
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
of the of the pllc is is professionally
 
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
licensed um I I think that I mean that
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't think that there's
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
another reason beyond that and so if you
 
01:40:47.599 --> 01:40:49.229 align:start position:0%
another reason beyond that and so if you
if

01:40:49.229 --> 01:40:49.239 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
you merely allow an assistant manager
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
who's not licensed to do nonprofessional
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
things for what is it up to a year right
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
that's up to a year I guess I don't see
 
01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
how that could you know sort of upset
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
the the pllc world I would and and I
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
guess you know law lawyers have been the
 
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
the the area that has um was raised by
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative Manos but as I understand
 
01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
from representative tur the medical
 
01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
society has
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
been uh questioned about this and
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps you've talked with other
 
01:41:28.589 --> 01:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
professional professionals that don't
 
01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
seem to have a problem so I that you
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
know that sort of gives me a lot of
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
comfort representative
 
01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:39.639 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
um I find this uh conversation
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
fascinating because basically everything
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
that we do that involves A
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
Change Is involving a change and um so
 
01:41:59.470 --> 01:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh if we didn't ever do that we wouldn't
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
have to spend any time here at all we
 
01:42:04.470 --> 01:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
could be out enjoying the sun um I
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
listened uh I think carefully to what my
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
colleague said about the uh the variety
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
of professional limited liability
 
01:42:18.910 --> 01:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
companies out there but we're talking
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
here about a
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
single member
 
01:42:27.669 --> 01:42:27.679 align:start position:0%
professional limited liability we're not
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:42:34.910 --> 01:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
um General Foods we're not talking about
 
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
any large Enterprise where of course
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
we're not relying on one person we're
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
talking about a tiny not even a mom and
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
pop operation a tiny mom operation or
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
pop operation but not both and this is
 
01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with the
 
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
situation that I think shows great
 
01:43:00.189 --> 01:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the part of the
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
individual who brought this bill to
 
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
representative tur's attention and that
 
01:43:09.589 --> 01:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
is he is a member of a professional
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
limited liability company he knows he's
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
not going to live forever or be able to
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
function forever and he wanted to make
 
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
sure that everyone was
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
able to carry out what needed to be
 
01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:30.280 align:start position:0%
carried out when he was no longer the
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
professional that's all this is it is
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
not remaking corporate law it is not
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
addressing any major entity it's just
 
01:43:44.229 --> 01:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
seeing in this very limited case where
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
there is a single member professional
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
who has set up a limited liability
 
01:43:52.679 --> 01:43:53.830 align:start position:0%
who has set up a limited liability
company

01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
this is to deal with what happens when
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
that person for whatever reason is no
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
longer able to function so it's not a
 
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
question of a manager being fired it's
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
not a question of of any of those things
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
it's just um uh it's it's like
 
01:44:16.589 --> 01:44:16.599 align:start position:0%
uh like a medical power of Eternity is
 
01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
you know the same kind of thing making
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
sure that there's somebody who can bring
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
this to an end without ignoring the
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the clients or the
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
patrons or whatever word you want to use
 
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
so I mean I don't want to say it's no
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
big deal because anything is a big deal
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
but I I think we're overthinking this a
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
little bit can I can I just make one
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
last yes representative CH please um and
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
I want to sort of it's a little bit
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
addressing representative Perez's
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
question um as far as I know and please
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
others that particularly on our
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee no one's sort of bubbled up
 
01:44:55.950 --> 01:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
known problem with this that that we
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
haven't like addressed it the question I
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
think the reason that the Secretary of
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
State's office and and perhaps others is
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
that there are folks that um we haven't
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
fully heard from you know people were
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
invited to our subcommittee meeting but
 
01:45:15.270 --> 01:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
we we didn't we didn't have that input
 
01:45:18.189 --> 01:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
directly so you know I I I it's not like
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
we're passing a bill but we know their
 
01:45:21.229 --> 01:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
flaws and we're hoping someone will fix
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
them down the line I guess you know as
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
far as I know and please everyone
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
correct me is is we we've dealt with it
 
01:45:30.189 --> 01:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
we've added language to make it as clear
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
as possible the delineation between sort
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
of what's corporate and what's
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
professional um in in the bill so I I I
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make it clear and and the
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
other thing a little bit to
 
01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
representative Ming's statement from our
 
01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
our our subcommittee um there are other
 
01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
corporate entities besides plc's and and
 
01:45:50.830 --> 01:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee I think I one of my
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
points was these exist they are single
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
entity uh plc's in the state and whether
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
or not that was their best possible
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
choice you know 30 years ago when it was
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
formed versus versus you know versus
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
today is is an area I'm hoping to sort
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
of avoid because the very existence of
 
01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
them I think is is the basis for for why
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're considering making the change all
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
right any uh representative trip um
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but it seems
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
that the entire purpose for this bill is
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
to permit a clean shutdown of a company
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know uh and as uh representative
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
Smith said you
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
know that needs this needs to be done so
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
the I guess the question I would have is
 
01:46:46.589 --> 01:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
what if we
 
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
don't pass this bill what what kind of
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
situation would uh
 
01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:57.719 align:start position:0%
be required when the sole professional
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
in an LLC you know
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
is the dies or whatever you know what
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
what happens in that
 
01:47:10.109 --> 01:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
situation no I mean I I let
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative tur speak to that but I
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
think that's exactly the point I think
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
you rais exactly the point of of this
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I think the distinction from
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
your question is a good one which is you
 
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
know because of the unique Str structure
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
and because of this prohibition on
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
naming somebody other than the the sole
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
you know professional it sort of leaves
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
these organizations in a what we've
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
described as a catch 22 they they can't
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
make a proactive decision sort of the
 
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
way it works is you sort of have a an
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
Unwritten agreement with another
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
professional to sort of come in and and
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
help you close out your business and
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
what it leaves you with is essentially
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
this business that that has has been
 
01:47:55.589 --> 01:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
your profession has no way forward it
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
basically has to shut down whereas with
 
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
this individual able to make
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
decisions that person could help um
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
could bring someone on on a contractual
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
basis to serve U not not you know not
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
not as a a member but as to to provide
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
Professional Services they could sell
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
the business to another entity they
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
could convert it to another type of
 
01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
legal entity like an LLC that that
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have that requirement so it
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
gives them a whole range of ways forward
 
01:48:28.109 --> 01:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
other than just essentially seeing the
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
business essentially collapse and go
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.719 --> 01:48:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
probate

01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:48:57.629 --> 01:48:57.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to um
 
01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
respond to representative Trip's
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
question by saying that I think the
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
situation with a single
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
member uh law practice pllc is different
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
than rep representative tur just
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
described so the B Association has both
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
ethical and um succession planning
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
guidance for single member um
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
plc's and there's a whole ethical
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
standard for what what is to occur when
 
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
the single member
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
pllc attorney dies or is disqualified or
 
01:49:35.679 --> 01:49:36.709 align:start position:0%
pllc attorney dies or is disqualified or
becomes

01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
disabled and that's where I think some
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
of the tension is coming from and it's
 
01:49:43.149 --> 01:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
why we added the final two
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
sentences um but I would just repeat
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
that I think once this bill goes to the
 
01:49:51.229 --> 01:49:51.239 align:start position:0%
other body assuming it makes it there if
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
it goes to the other body then that body
 
01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
will hear testimony which could include
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
um someone from the bar association and
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
could include an attorney who does
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
business entity formation practice and
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
so I think we'll get I think that the
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
other body will get the answers to those
 
01:50:13.149 --> 01:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
questions well can I just interrupt to
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%
just and apologize to we I just asked
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
Karen to pass around a a document for
 
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
the next bill we're going to take up and
 
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
I copied the wrong document so ignore
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
what you ignore what was just passed
 
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:28.400 align:start position:0%

01:50:31.070 --> 01:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
document uh uh to you when we get to
 
01:50:33.629 --> 01:50:33.639 align:start position:0%
1432 and I
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
apologize that's the one I I emailed
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%

back to uh back to 1082 does anyone have
 
01:50:47.149 --> 01:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
any further um comments on on the
 
01:50:49.149 --> 01:50:49.159 align:start position:0%
amendment uh therefore well then I'm
 
01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
going to uh I'm going to uh ask I think
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%

01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
show of hands does anybody object to
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
that all right then all all those in
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
favor of adopting Amendment 2024
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
1060 to House Bill 1082 please raise

01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
hand appears that we are unanimous
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
anyone opposed right so 20
 
01:51:15.119 --> 01:51:20.069 align:start position:0%

um all right
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
and since that replaces the the
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
amendment places the uh replaces the
 
01:51:28.679 --> 01:51:30.189 align:start position:0%
amendment places the uh replaces the
entire

01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh bill I guess except for the um the
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
effective date right that's the only
 
01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:36.920 align:start position:0%

may recall this was representative gon's
 
01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:57.320 align:start position:0%
initially um and it's um it's now had uh
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's now been touched so to speak by a
 
01:59:00.910 --> 01:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
number of representatives and I
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
particularly want to thank
 
01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh Manos and
 
01:59:04.239 --> 01:59:05.430 align:start position:0%
representative uh Manos and
representative

01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
Corman um we we we
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh relied heavily on representative
 
01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
corman's expertise in the definition
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
sections of what artificial intelligence
 
01:59:21.669 --> 01:59:21.679 align:start position:0%
what constitutes artificial intelligence
 
01:59:25.069 --> 01:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
and what constitutes a deep fake and
 
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
candidly his his definitions were much
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
better than our original definitions um
 
01:59:33.069 --> 01:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
um and so I really appreciate his work
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
on that um as you may know there were I
 
01:59:38.159 --> 01:59:39.550 align:start position:0%
on that um as you may know there were I
believe

01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
five bills in various committees dealing
 
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
with um one aspect or another of
 
01:59:50.709 --> 01:59:50.719 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence um the the
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
criminal uh Justice and Public Safety
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
commission committee had two
 
01:59:59.709 --> 01:59:59.719 align:start position:0%
bills um uh both of which they have uh
 
02:00:02.669 --> 02:00:02.679 align:start position:0%
one of which I I believe they already uh
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
we already voted on um uh to to itl it
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
and the other one I think is is up uh
 
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
they're not going forward with it with
 
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
it anyway and as a result of this
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
meeting I was uh that I should spend
 
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
some time on talking to you about so
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
there was there was two bills in
 
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
criminal justice there's one in
 
02:00:22.950 --> 02:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
Edna and there's won an election and
 
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
then there's
 
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:27.880 align:start position:0%
1432 we had a meeting um earlier this
 
02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
week um the main goal of which was to
 
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that in all of those bills we
 
02:00:37.950 --> 02:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
use the same Definition of artificial
 
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
intelligence and now we've we we have we
 
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
achieved agreement at that meeting that
 
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
that that the definition of artificial
 
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
intelligence and deep fake uh that is in
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh in this bill will be the same
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
definition that is used in um all the
 
02:01:01.149 --> 02:01:01.159 align:start position:0%
other bills um criminal justice is not
 
02:01:04.270 --> 02:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
going to go forward with their bills
 
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
because this bill has a criminal penalty
 
02:01:12.069 --> 02:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
um uh criminal violation provision in it
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
now the speaker may just so you know the
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
speaker may decide if we uh if this bill
 
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
is passed on the floor he may decide to
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
refer this bill to criminal justice for
 
02:01:23.069 --> 02:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
some further review because it does
 
02:01:27.750 --> 02:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.390 --> 02:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
provision ah VI okay so presumably he
 
02:01:33.069 --> 02:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
will not do that then okay because
 
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
because of the deadline all right but
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
anyway they know I mean criminal justice
 
02:01:38.589 --> 02:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
knows that we're going forward with this
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
and they're fine they're they're they're
 
02:01:42.030 --> 02:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
fine with that they basically defer to
 
02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:43.870 align:start position:0%
fine with that they basically defer to
us

02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:01:47.510 --> 02:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
um uh with regard to election
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
law they are going they are very
 
02:01:53.229 --> 02:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
concerned uh on bipartisan basis in
 
02:01:56.189 --> 02:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
election law with having a bill that
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
will take effect as soon as possible
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
because they're concerned about the
 
02:02:04.069 --> 02:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
upcoming election they their bill
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with this the only remedy that
 
02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
it will have is a the ability to get an
 
02:02:13.629 --> 02:02:13.639 align:start position:0%
injunction in other words there's not
 
02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
going to be any criminal
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
penalty um uh and there is some language
 
02:02:21.629 --> 02:02:21.639 align:start position:0%
apparently in their bill that says you
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
know May pursue other uh other available
 
02:02:28.270 --> 02:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
remedies so supposedly I mean presumably
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
somebody might be able to bring some
 
02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
kind of civil
 
02:02:34.149 --> 02:02:34.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um but the main thing they're
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
concerned about is the ability to get an
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
injunction they will not have any
 
02:02:42.750 --> 02:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties in their bill
 
02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:44.750 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties in their bill
um

02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:48.990 --> 02:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
nonetheless as as I pointed out to them
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
when this bill becomes effective which
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
will not be in time for this election
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
but when this bill becomes effective
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
there will the criminal penalties that
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
apply here or the Civil penalties civil
 
02:03:01.870 --> 02:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
remedies that apply presumably could
 
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
apply you know not to to deep fakes in
 
02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
the election context or in any other
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
context so it could apply um uh to
 
02:03:18.189 --> 02:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
election um issues um so the
 
02:03:21.390 --> 02:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
the next thing that I want to uh kind of
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
review with everyone is um it you'll see
 
02:03:29.229 --> 02:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
that in section one of the bill a crime
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
is defined uh class B felony if somebody
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
uses a deep
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
fake uh for purposes of embarrassing
 
02:03:39.069 --> 02:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
harassing and trapping defaming
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
extorting or otherwise causing any
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
Financial or reputational harm to an
 
02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
identifiable person and then there's a
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
separate class B felony if as a result
 
02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
of the deep fake um someone
 
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
um uh someone is is uh you know
 
02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
improperly arrested
 
02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
um um that's a that's a separate felony
 
02:04:07.470 --> 02:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
the important things to note here and
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
this applies to both the criminal
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
penalties and the Civil cause of action
 
02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
that is created are the are the four
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions uh which in which state
 
02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
basically when the the prohibitions of
 
02:04:27.149 --> 02:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
the statute don't
 
02:04:27.159 --> 02:04:29.430 align:start position:0%
the statute don't
apply

02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
um three of them
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
are controlled to a greater or lesser
 
02:04:41.470 --> 02:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
extent by federal law the first one is
 
02:04:42.629 --> 02:04:42.639 align:start position:0%
um section
 
02:04:46.669 --> 02:04:46.679 align:start position:0%
230 of uh title 47 of the US
 
02:04:52.830 --> 02:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
code um which uh which uh
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
basically precludes us from um imposing
 
02:05:03.549 --> 02:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
liability um on on someone who is just a
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
um an interactive Computer Service uh uh
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
a computer service provider as defined
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
in the statute but note that there's an
 
02:05:17.709 --> 02:05:17.719 align:start position:0%
exception the the
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
the the immunity for lack of a better
 
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
term that is that federal law affords to
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
um internet computer service providers
 
02:05:31.950 --> 02:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
is if they're acting just as an
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
internet uh service provider you'll note
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
that this that if the if the Deep fake
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
was actually created by the internet
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
service provider then they're acting in
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
another role and they could be held by
 
02:05:48.910 --> 02:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not excluded then um
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
the second uh Sub sub paragraph
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
B um is designed
 
02:05:59.510 --> 02:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
to indicate that we're not either
 
02:06:01.870 --> 02:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
criminalizing or provide or affording as
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
a basis for civil remedy situations in
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
which a the media is reporting about a
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
deep fake in other words if they're if
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
you know if they're going to if they're
 
02:06:18.669 --> 02:06:18.679 align:start position:0%
running a story that says candidate a uh
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
ran a deep fake about candidate B and
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
that's the story um then they're then
 
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're entitled I mean I think it
 
02:06:28.069 --> 02:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
probably would be a First Amendment
 
02:06:29.629 --> 02:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
violation if you if they couldn't do
 
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
that but this allows them to do that um
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
it indicates though that that there must
 
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
be a clear
 
02:06:40.549 --> 02:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment in the in the story that
 
02:06:42.430 --> 02:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
there's a question about the
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
authenticity of the materials I mean
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
they can't um they if they're going to
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
run a story about um a deep fake they H
 
02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
they have to knowledge that there's at
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
least a question about it C is the one
 
02:06:58.189 --> 02:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
that representative Manos and I had a
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
number of discussions about because it's
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
candidly it's a it's something that I
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
think both of us feel it's too bad
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
federal law is the way it is but it
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
essentially what it says is that in
 
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
regard to paid political
 
02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:17.069 align:start position:0%
regard to paid political
advertising

02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
um there that's exempt from the criminal
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
and civil penalties that are
 
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
created um provided that the entity that
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
the entity the magazine newspaper
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
television station whatever um does not
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
remove or modify any disclaimer provided
 
02:07:40.189 --> 02:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
by the Creator or sponsor of the
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
election communication so what this
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
means and I'm you know I I went back and
 
02:07:48.189 --> 02:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
forth with some of the people from the
 
02:07:49.709 --> 02:07:49.719 align:start position:0%
communications industry about this
 
02:07:52.149 --> 02:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
because I was really I was basically
 
02:07:54.109 --> 02:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
saying to them show me because I what I
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to say was I originally as this
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
was drafted it would have
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
said if you know if you're a if you're a
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
broadcaster that's dealing with a paid
 
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
political advertisement and you know not
 
02:08:09.950 --> 02:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
just think or maybe you should know
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
whatever but you know it's a deep
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
fake and you go ahead and run it anyway
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
you should be held liable they said no
 
02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
no you can't do that that's violation of
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
federal law and I said show me and they
 
02:08:26.430 --> 02:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
did they they showed they basically it's
 
02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
this is goes back to I think this the
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
communications Act of 1934 I think and
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
worded you know in the way that we would
 
02:08:38.669 --> 02:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
like a modern statute might be word but
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
it basically what it says is no
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
censorship um and that has been
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
interpreted to me and I and I
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
suppose mean I I I I suppose you can
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
make an argument of understanding why
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is so and in the political context
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
I guess the idea is you know All is fair
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
and Love and War and if it's politics
 
02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's kind of the way
 
02:09:05.310 --> 02:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
that's uh we don't want to be we don't
 
02:09:06.669 --> 02:09:06.679 align:start position:0%
want to be sort
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
of really
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh carefully carefully scrutinizing what
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
people say in political campaigns
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
because that'll show First Amendment
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
rights and all that at any rate um
 
02:09:22.589 --> 02:09:22.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way the the law has
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
been interpreted is that you know they
 
02:09:27.149 --> 02:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
if it's even if it's
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
false if it's a paid political
 
02:09:31.470 --> 02:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
advertisement they have to run it and
 
02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:35.559 align:start position:0%
note that the disclaimer that is at that
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
referred to in the end of the of section
 
02:09:42.750 --> 02:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
c that disclaimer does not mean does not
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
mean that that the disclaimer says by
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
the way this is a deep fate it just
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
means that you know the standard thing
 
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
this is a paid political advertisement
 
02:09:55.629 --> 02:09:55.639 align:start position:0%
if they put that in there um you know I
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
I guess the theory is you're on notice
 
02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
that this a paid political advertisement
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
and you know those politicians they may
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
say anything so so be on your guard I
 
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:08.599 align:start position:0%
think that's the idea and then the last
 
02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
one uh the LA subsection
 
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
D is that um there's an exception where
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
uh you're talking about a parody or
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
satire if somebody
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
if somebody's uh uh doing a deep fake
 
02:10:27.239 --> 02:10:28.589 align:start position:0%
if somebody's uh uh doing a deep fake
that

02:10:28.589 --> 02:10:28.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
um it involves some kind of parody or
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
satire I again I think there would be a
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
First Amendment problem if you tried to
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh prohibit that so um that's uh the
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
language as I should say it has
 
02:10:46.990 --> 02:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
been reviewed by representative Corman
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
who drafted the definitions by
 
02:10:50.950 --> 02:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
representative Manos and by this other
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
group group of bipartisan group of the
 
02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:55.669 align:start position:0%
group group of bipartisan group of the
other

02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
committees um and although they were I
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
wanted in in in fairness they were
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
focusing mainly on the definitions but
 
02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
they did review the the the language and
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
I haven't and we've we've accommodated
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
the qu the suggestions and changes made
 
02:11:13.549 --> 02:11:13.559 align:start position:0%
by representative Manos and
 
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative Corman um and I think I
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
think this is good to go so with that
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
I'll shut up and uh take questions
 
02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
representative tur yeah just one
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
question on that section c that you just
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
talked about it we sort you sort of
 
02:11:32.709 --> 02:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
described it as pertaining to paid
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
political ads but it's not really worded
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
that way it's sort of worded just to
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
apply to any paid um publication if I'm
 
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
reading it right and so I wasn't sure I
 
02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
know it says disclaimer at the end but
 
02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
um that's only if they don't remove a
 
02:11:50.109 --> 02:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
disclaimer so I didn't know is part C
 
02:11:55.069 --> 02:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
basically meant to cover all um all paid
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
publication no I think what it says
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
it is paid to publish distributor
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
broadcast an election
 
02:12:04.229 --> 02:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
communication ah okay an election
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
communication okay sorry I was looking
 
02:12:08.030 --> 02:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
for political but I found the wrong word
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
02:12:16.549 --> 02:12:16.559 align:start position:0%
Oregon these a little bit tricky just
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
because things have gotten so bizarre in
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
recent years it's hard to tell what's
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
attire what's real these days but I I
 
02:12:25.069 --> 02:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
mean I think the language that we have
 
02:12:27.629 --> 02:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
in here is is fine so it does allow
 
02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
people to continue to saiz or parody the
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
political process even though as I said
 
02:12:34.030 --> 02:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell these days what's a
 
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
parody and what's real but that's and
 
02:12:38.669 --> 02:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
you know I think I I think you're
 
02:12:41.790 --> 02:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely right I I would this is as
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
with with the
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
Privacy bill that we dealt with uh a
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
while ago which is now by the way become
 
02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
law 255 is now law um
 
02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh this is something that that should be
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
dealt with I think on the at the federal
 
02:13:00.910 --> 02:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
level uh you know for for uniformity and
 
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
I really do think that Congress should
 
02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
at least consider changing the the
 
02:13:09.149 --> 02:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
section I referred to before because wow
 
02:13:10.830 --> 02:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
if you really know that something is
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
just BL you know the thing that came to
 
02:13:17.109 --> 02:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
my mind is suppose the day before the
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
election uh uh candidate Biden on the
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
one hand or candidate Trump on the other
 
02:13:27.709 --> 02:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
got somebody to uh you
 
02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
know fake that person's campaign uh
 
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
management saying you know I uh I'm
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
sorry to report that the candidate
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
passed away this afternoon I mean and it
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
was absolutely false if a broadcaster
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
knew that and broadcasted it anyway I
 
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
know they walk away from that I would
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
say I would have a problem with that but
 
02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
that seems to be I don't think
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately a case like that hasn't come
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
up but I mean it does seem like that's
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's something that Congress ought to
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
deal with um anyway uh further
 
02:14:10.750 --> 02:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
comments All right so um I guess then on
 
02:14:13.549 --> 02:14:13.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment um I think can we do that
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
by a show of hands um uh all those in
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
favor of amendment 2024 1100 please
 
02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:22.760 align:start position:0%

consent it's got
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
oh but it's not going to but it not it
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
was yeah it was not an early bill so I
 
02:16:02.589 --> 02:16:02.599 align:start position:0%
let's try it for consent Paul will tell
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
okay right yeah he will definitely tell
 
02:16:11.310 --> 02:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
you we're wrong and I will write the uh
 
02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
report on that um all right I think
 
02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
think we yes certainly uh I noticed that
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
there are two bills from the Senate that
 
02:16:26.109 --> 02:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
were put on our
 
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
plates um and I looked at one of them
 
02:16:34.190 --> 02:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
and I think it might be here in error
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
and before you do anything about
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
scheduling it I wonder if you would
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
check with um the powers that be because
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
I think it ought to go to um Health and
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
Human Services I I will do that no
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
that's that I will absolutely do that so
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
that leaves only
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
one Senate Bill do you have any idea of
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
how many other Senate bills we're going
 
02:17:02.070 --> 02:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
to get have you been given a secret I no
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
I have not I think I think there are
 
02:17:06.469 --> 02:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
more than these two but I don't but I
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
don't uh I don't know how many um so you
 
02:17:13.549 --> 02:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
know what let me let me I guess what I I
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
I think you're you make a very good
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion and I will definitely do that
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
to check on that it includes the
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
judicial branch in the office of public
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
Guardian right that's the only reference
 
02:17:27.389 --> 02:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
and no yeah so I will know I'm going to
 
02:17:30.030 --> 02:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
go see Paul um you know right away and
 
02:17:32.589 --> 02:17:32.599 align:start position:0%
ask him about whether that but let me
 
02:17:35.389 --> 02:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
ask you this so here's so I guess what I
 
02:17:37.549 --> 02:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
the way I'd like to leave it is this I'm
 
02:17:40.270 --> 02:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
gonna and I'm GNA do this right away if
 
02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:42.509 align:start position:0%
gonna and I'm GNA do this right away if
we

02:17:42.509 --> 02:17:42.519 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
have by if 185 stays with Judiciary and
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
we have two bills that uh my inclination
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
would be to have an exec I mean to have
 
02:17:55.070 --> 02:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
a hearing um next Wednesday starting at
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
10: if it's only one bill if 185 goes
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
away and it's only one bill um I
 
02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:04.519 align:start position:0%
probably would would not but we it may
 
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
be that we have you know that I that we
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
have other bills that I don't know about
 
02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
so yeah but meanwhile in order to get C
 
02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
I have to do it Wednesday and you'd have
 
02:18:20.230 --> 02:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
to know by noon i' have right right
 
02:18:21.870 --> 02:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
exactly no exactly so I'm going to try
 
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
to find guess what I'm saying is um we
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
may or may not we may we may or may not
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
if there I would probably if it's just
 
02:18:31.509 --> 02:18:31.519 align:start position:0%
one bill I won't do it if it's more than
 
02:18:33.349 --> 02:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
one bill I probably will do it but we'll
 
02:18:36.309 --> 02:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
start at 10 o'clock and uh yes
 
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bo um this one regardless
 
02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
of whether we are
 
02:18:42.629 --> 02:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
HHS does it um the
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
sooner sooner it gets through the
 
02:18:47.469 --> 02:18:47.479 align:start position:0%
process assuming the P house uh agrees
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
to it um the sooner it gets to the
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
governor's Destiny assign it and the can
 
02:18:52.830 --> 02:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
be appointed and start its
 
02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
work um sooner so that would give it
 
02:18:58.589 --> 02:18:58.599 align:start position:0%
like a couple more weeks if we did it
 
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
sooner that might make a difference if
 
02:19:02.349 --> 02:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
it has like whatever however three or
 
02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
four more weeks to do its work because
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to have everything done by
 
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
November 1st which uh seems like a long
 
02:19:11.070 --> 02:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
way away but it's pretty soon so you
 
02:19:12.509 --> 02:19:12.519 align:start position:0%
know what representative cab just
 
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
checked and apparently there are six
 
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
bills that have gone to us so chances
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
are we will be meeting next Wednesday um
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go
 
02:19:23.030 --> 02:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to go talk with Karen right
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
now but I think we probably will be
 
02:19:27.150 --> 02:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
meeting on Wednesday um you know one
 
02:19:30.790 --> 02:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
other thing that I wanted to um bring up
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
just so that I I've talked to
 
02:19:34.750 --> 02:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith about this um so
 
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
everybody knows this there you may
 
02:19:40.349 --> 02:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
remember that we passed um Senate Bill
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
255 we made some changes um one of the
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
changes that we made was to have the
 
02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State involved in the um
 
02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
involved in the process of how of what
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
companies that are subject to it uh sort
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
of have to do um the secretary of state
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
has has now and that by the way that
 
02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
bill as just as we passed it it was
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
passed by the house and the Senate
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
concurred and the governor signed it so
 
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's now the law um the secretary of
 
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
state has proposed some changes to the
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill that substantive that I at least
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
personally I I've looked at them I don't
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
have any problem with the substance of
 
02:20:28.510 --> 02:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
what the Secretary of State wants to
 
02:20:31.469 --> 02:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
changes to be
 
02:20:35.710 --> 02:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
but the the the upshot of those changes
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
that the secretary of state would be
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
sort of out of the business of having
 
02:20:45.510 --> 02:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
any particular role in the in the
 
02:20:47.630 --> 02:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
Privacy thing in other words it would it
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
would state in sort of in detail this is
 
02:20:51.550 --> 02:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
what this is what what companies have to
 
02:20:55.510 --> 02:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
do but the the the secretary of state
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
would be kind of out of it um and I rais
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
that just because I know that I think
 
02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
sort of on a bipartisan basis um people
 
02:21:08.190 --> 02:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
had some people wanted the Secretary of
 
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
State to be involved so um and I anyway
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
this is just this is just this is
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
something that I my point here is this
 
02:21:17.230 --> 02:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
is something that may come back to us at
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
some point and just sort of have it on
 
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
your radar screen I guess it's all I
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
would say um if I could just add to that
 
02:21:26.590 --> 02:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
you were kind enough to ask me about it
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
and to ask representative f um who was
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
um a sponsor and both representative F
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
and I um were not as positive as you are
 
02:21:48.429 --> 02:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
about um supporting that change um so I
 
02:21:51.990 --> 02:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how that will un fold CU I
 
02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what the secretary of state
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
will do about it in the Senate but I
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
just thought that helps to complete the
 
02:22:00.990 --> 02:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
story you know and so you know what just
 
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
just a sort of slight clarification what
 
02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
I what I want to say is I in terms of
 
02:22:09.870 --> 02:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
the substance of the
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
changes I I don't have any problem with
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
the substance of the changes but what I
 
02:22:17.429 --> 02:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
what I do have at least an issue with I
 
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
guess I'm open on this is it would seem
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
to me that one of the possibilities
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
would be that the we that the Secretary
 
02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
of State could simply adopt those
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
changes as
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
regulations uh which would kind of keep
 
02:22:35.389 --> 02:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
him his office in the in the sort of
 
02:22:39.710 --> 02:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
review role that I think the legislation
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
originally um contemplated
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
and you know the I mean I I sort of
 
02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
understand why they don't want to do
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
that but um that's sort of what I think
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
we wanted them to do so yeah I have a I
 
02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
think that this is a little bit like
 
02:22:58.150 --> 02:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
putting the fox in charge of the hen
 
02:23:01.630 --> 02:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
housee saying that the very
 
02:23:01.640 --> 02:23:04.950 align:start position:0%
housee saying that the very
corporations

02:23:04.950 --> 02:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
um that we think might benefit from a
 
02:23:12.230 --> 02:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
little outside
 
02:23:16.349 --> 02:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
review um would be reviewing themselves
 
02:23:19.150 --> 02:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
in a way it reminds me of what we were
 
02:23:21.670 --> 02:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
troubled with about the Department of
 
02:23:25.070 --> 02:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services that the same
 
02:23:29.349 --> 02:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
people who conduct the hearings would
 
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
conduct the
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
appeals um and rather than have a fresh
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
look at it um now there's no telling how
 
02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
that will unfold but that's I think why
 
02:23:44.910 --> 02:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
both representative Earth and I had a
 
02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:46.469 align:start position:0%
both representative Earth and I had a
little

02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
problem right so anything else anybody
 
02:23:52.030 --> 02:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
wants to uh discuss all right well great
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
thanks everybody and uh so we will you
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
can count that we'll be on for next week
 
02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:03.990 align:start position:0%
can count that we'll be on for next week
okay

02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
thanks
