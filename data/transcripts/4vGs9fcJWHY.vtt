00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
bullet points to provide some further um
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
explanation so I've done this in the
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
order of the bill sections and I've
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
referenced the bill sections I'm hoping
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
that helps you follow along um so first
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
first uh we're requesting a change to
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
require all of our lienes to license and
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
file reports through the through the
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
nmls system um this is a system
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
electronic system that we currently have
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
all of our mortgage industry licenses
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
using um but we maintain a dual
 
00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
licensing uh system for folks who don't
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
license through nmls what we're asking
 
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
for is to require all lenses to use the
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
nmls system that'll eliminate the Dual
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
systems that we currently have to
 
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
maintain and operate um we're going to
 
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
be uh asking for this change for um
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
currently retail sellers sales finance
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
companies small own lenders debt
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
adjusters and money transmitters last
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
session we asked for these changes for
 
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
the money transmitters but that um Bill
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
hb1 1437 got caught up in the Omnibus
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
bills that were vetoed so it
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately didn't
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
pass um so those are bills sections 1
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
through 50 to make all those changes
 
00:08:37.389 --> 00:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
happen next in sections 16 through 19 um
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're asking again to have the
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
provisions that were um put forward last
 
00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:44.839 align:start position:0%
session in HB
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
1695 um incorporated into law um 1695
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
from last session was a result of the
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 98 study committee
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
addressing trust companies um so these
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
requirements would uh add a requirement
 
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
in law that would have new trust
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
directors submit to a background check
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
it would give the commissioner authority
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
to remove directors or officers of trust
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
companies and Family Trust companies if
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
needed um I would note that the analysis
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
um references that the provisions would
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
be applicable to both TR applicable for
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
the background check to trust officers
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
it should actually read to trust
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
directors but the removal Provisions
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
apply to both directors and officers so
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
just the analysis SE
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
um that Roman numeral description was a
 
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
little off just wanted to make that
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
point but the bill itself is
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
correct um and then section 20 um again
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
is another provision that was put
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
forward in uh last session that was HB
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
1696 again as a result of the Senate
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 98 study committee this proposal
 
00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
would increase the fee for uh filing an
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
application to Charter a new Trust
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
Company bank or credit Union it
 
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
increases that fee from $10,000 to
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
$155,000 and also authorizes the
 
00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner to charge additional uh
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
fees costs uh for reviewing more
 
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.190 align:start position:0%
fees costs uh for reviewing more
complicated

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
applications um we did have one change
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
from last sessions language in 1696
 
00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839 align:start position:0%
which was made at the request of
 
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
Industry Representatives um just to
 
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
clarify the process uh by which we
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
notify them that additional charges may
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
be incurred um
 
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.910 align:start position:0%
be incurred um
section

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
21 addresses assessments uh we uh on
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
occasion have uh entities that are
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
charted in New Hampshire and they either
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
uh close close their doors they dissolve
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
or they convert from State Charter to
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
Federal Charter um currently we have the
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
authority to assess those institutions
 
00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
but sometimes the transition from State
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
Charter to Federal Charter or their
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
dissolution happens before we've had a
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
chance to actually issue the invoice for
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
the assessment so we're just trying to
 
00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:06.639 align:start position:0%
clarify the law to give um some some um
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
additional um requirements that will
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
allow the commissioner to work with
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
those companies to collect that
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
assessment and then finally um in
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
section 22 or so not finally we've got a
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
few more in section 22 we're asking to
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
have the interest rates that are used
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
for um payment uh of interest on escro
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
accounts that um pay the taxes and um
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
Insurance on
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
mortgages um we're asking to have that
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
interest rate tied to the federal funds
 
00:11:39.509 --> 00:11:39.519 align:start position:0%
interest rate currently we calculate
 
00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
that interest rate and we have to ask
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
twice a year ask the depository Banks to
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
submit information to allow us to
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
develop that rate by tying it to federal
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
funds interest rates we don't have to do
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
that calculation and the banks can uh go
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
directly to that federal funds website
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
um uh Open Market Committee website and
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
get that interest rate
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
themselves and then finally um sections
 
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
23 through 28 um this is a provision
 
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
that was again put forward last session
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
that was an HB
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
1437 that bill was also caught up in the
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills in vetto but the
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
provisions would allow us to transmit
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints via email rather
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
than uh through snail mail U certified
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
post office mail um we really have
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
especially with Co had a difficult time
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
managing uh to mail out these letters
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
with post office issues they don't get
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
delivered and sometimes it takes weeks
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
and weeks for us to get a complaint to a
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
leny um so we would like the ability to
 
00:12:45.189 --> 00:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
send them by email which is much more
 
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
efficient um allows us to ensure that
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
the entity has received that email same
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
day with with the the the um ability for
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
using receipt received um options and
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
Outlook that we have so we're asking for
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
these changes to be put in place and
 
00:13:03.509 --> 00:13:03.519 align:start position:0%
this would affect all of our both
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
licensed and chartered
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
institutions so those are all the
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
changes um that we're requesting and I'm
 
00:13:12.269 --> 00:13:12.279 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and I have
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
with me uh other folks from the
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
Department who are much more
 
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about these provisions and
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
can answer more specific questions that
 
00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:20.839 align:start position:0%
I can't okay well we have one raised
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
hand uh representative Terry uh you got
 
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
to First unmute yourself there you go uh
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
first a question for you Mr chair um I
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
requested a packet uh of bills that were
 
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
going to be considered today be mailed
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
to me and the packet was mailed on the
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
22nd and I'm not seeing Bill number 610
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
in the packet bill so I'm at a distinct
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
disadvantage here being able to
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
participate with respect to the
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
discussion and consideration of this
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill wondering how I can access that and
 
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
then second Mr chairman if I may ask a
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
question of Miss doino once you respond
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
to me okay so yeah so if um I I assume
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
you only have one computer but uh you do
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
need to pull up if you pull up your uh
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
search engine uh and go into the House
 
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.430 align:start position:0%
search engine uh and go into the House
of

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
Representatives and in House of
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives there are several ways
 
00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
to go find bills um I usually go to the
 
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
committee and then say bills that are in
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
the committee but right on that front
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
screen it'll say ask you for a bill
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
number so if you type in hb610 it should

certainly if I may uh and I'm sorry uh
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
Miss doino I am unable to specify
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
exactly when and where you referenced a
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
proposed fee increase from $10,000 to
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
$15,000 yes that was a a provision that
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
was put forward last year uh it affects
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
trust companies Banks and Credit Unions
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
that are seeking to be chartered in New
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um those changes were uh
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
worked out as a result of the Senate
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 98 study committee um and currently
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
the fee is $10,000 to Charter a new bank
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
credit union or trust company and that
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
um is increasing from $10,000 to
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
$15,000 so if I uh question you may
 
00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:32.839 align:start position:0%
inquire so if I may thank you uh thank
 
00:15:32.839 --> 00:15:33.470 align:start position:0%
inquire so if I may thank you uh thank
you

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
sir uh what apparently the fate of the
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
request last year died or was rejected
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
if you could speak to the history of
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
that from the last session I would
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate it as a new member and second
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
with respect and second if I may with
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
respect to the
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
increase uh since we're talking about a
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
state function um how does the current
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
and how does the proposed fee compare to
 
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.150 align:start position:0%
and how does the proposed fee compare to
other

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
states um the same service right I
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know what the other
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
states charge but perhaps giving you a
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
little more information about how the
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
banking department works and how we
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
funded might be helpful um the banking
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
department is not General funded um in
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
that at the end of each year we use um a
 
00:16:30.509 --> 00:16:30.519 align:start position:0%
calculation to determine if the fees
 
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
we've collected cover all of the
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
operating costs of the department if
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
they don't we impose an assessment and
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
then all of our chartered institutions
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
kick in and pay that assessment so by
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
increasing the fee what we're hoping to
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
do is capture the actual work involved
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
in reviewing those trust um and Bank Etc
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
applications that are filed if we don't
 
00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:54.759 align:start position:0%
capture the cost of reviewing the
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
application from the applicant then the
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
rest of the institutions um foot the
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
bill and pay more in the assessment so
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's really uh more of a cost shifting
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
from um what we're trying to accomplish
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
is have the institution filing the
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
application pay the the cost for us
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
reviewing that application as opposed to
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
pushing the cost onto the assessment and
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
institutions um I can look and find out
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the other states May charge for
 
00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:25.720 align:start position:0%
similar applications if that would be
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
helpful um I don't have that information
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman one one last followup yes uh
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Miss doino um would you do
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
so please with res respect to your offer
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
to to look at um other states and what
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
they charge for a comparable service um
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
and uh given uh a time and perhaps
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
staffing issues I would be satisfied if
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
um if if you would do so for uh New York
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
and the New England states I don't see
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
any reason personally for me to uh to
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
have you do a 50 state survey but
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
regionally New York and and the New
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
England states I would appreciate that
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%

the general court and making sure your

bills are there and just print out what
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
might be missing would help us um all
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
when we're when we're ready for um
 
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.830 align:start position:0%
when we're when we're ready for um
committee

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to drop your hand okay and
 
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.430 align:start position:0%

representative

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
AEL you are
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
muted thank you um there's a category of
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh large family trusts uh some that are
 
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
foreign uh or I should say alien being
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
outside the United States I wonder if
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
this affects them or are they Exempted
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
from any of the changes here uh they are
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
not exempt from the changes um the
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
changes that would affect trust
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
companies um let me just go through it
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
methodically the background check would
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
apply to them for the new directors
 
00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
um the assessment would apply to them
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
where we're seeking to um collect the
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
assessment if they were to um
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
dissolve um and the um complaint
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
Provisions I think would apply to them
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
as well so yes it applies consistently
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
to any of our charted institutions
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
family or or or um non-family trust
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
companies and if that's um I'll go back
 
00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
and double check that if that's
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
incorrect I'll I'll certainly let you
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
folks okay uh anybody else have any
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions I um I would be remissive I
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
didn't uh point out that um I did have a
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
phone call um from the Auto Dealers
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
Association and they're a little
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about um the the
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
notification uh because they're used to
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
getting the notification by certified
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
mail and they're worried about being
 
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
sent an email and having it end up in
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
their in their junk box
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
um but I I would I would hope that
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
because they're in the sales business
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have too much there in their
 
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
junk that that they're always like me um
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
I never know when I consist when sends
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
me a letter sends me an email I have to
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
I I so I did did away with my my junk uh
 
00:20:48.909 --> 00:20:48.919 align:start position:0%
sorry just because it it I I've got to
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
be able to see see everything so could
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
you respond to that concern um about how
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
we make sure that that dealers uh uh or
 
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:00.200 align:start position:0%
anybody uh if we're sending it to them
 
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
by email that they will make sure they
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
actually get it in a timely fashion yes
 
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
so um first of all when you become
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
licensed through the department you're
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
required to provide us with contact
 
00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
information so that we can get in touch
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
um we often need to reach out to a
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
license e uh obviously if there's a
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
Consumer complaint if we need to discuss
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
with them some concern we may have um
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
setting up examinations Etc so as part
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
of the licensing process there required
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
to give us uh contact information and
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
they're also required by law to update
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
that information um at any time so if
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
their contact information changes they
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
need to give us that um we have not had
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
any issues with reaching Folks by email
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
we have had issues reaching Folks by
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
certified mail through the post office
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
we've had those uh certified mailings
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
come back uh with email it's much easier
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
to find that to to confirm that
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
someone's received the email um so we
 
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
have not had the issue with the email I
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
understand that there are concerns there
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
are a whole host of ways to address
 
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
those on the The lenses end uh first of
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
all of course to keep keep the contact
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
information updated um but in addition
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
if they add the banking Department to
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
their contact um uh contacts then we
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
won't get stuck in the spam um and there
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
are other things that they can do they
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
can create a um consistent email address
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
that multiple people access just in case
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
someone's on vacation then other people
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
will be checking the email there's
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
there's a whole host of wonderful
 
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
technological solutions to these issues
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
and um we're certainly willing to work
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
with our
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
lenes um if we send an email and we
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
don't hear back we we are always
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
reaching back out and trying to contact
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
them so I don't think in in real terms
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to be an issue for
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%

the committee room right and I can't see
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
610 okay representative Johnson do you
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
have a question yes I
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
do go ahead my question is on the
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
beginning talking about it being finance
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
loans debors and stuff and so forth but
 
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
what do you mean and and can you clarify
 
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.269 align:start position:0%
what do you mean and and can you clarify
retail

00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
sellers because when I think of a retail
 
00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
store right so
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
I sorry this this is a clerk I'm not
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
able to understand what was just said so
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative Johnson is asking what
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
is a retail seller if I is that correct
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
represented Johnson right because when I
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
anybody else is right so what is the
 
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
definition of retail seller when we come
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
to the banking statute yeah okay
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative sure attorney Doo yes yes
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
so the retail sellers are the folks that
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
basically are the car dealerships that
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
are helping to arrange the financing um
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
using a retail installment contract they
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
help the consumer uh they you know have
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
there with the consumer when the
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
consumer buys a car helps them fill out
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
the loan application and then ultimately
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
that loan is transferred to the lender
 
00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
so that is your your retail seller thank
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
you app okay so just so we let's make
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
sure we all understand this um uh so uh
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
when I was in the computer retail
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
business I used to help we used to help
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
people get uh uh ge financing to buy a
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
computer um I'm I'm a in the retail
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
business do I have to register with the
 
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
banking Department no the retail sellers
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about are the folks
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
that are just selling cars we don't
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
regulate other folks that help arrange
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
financing for buying sofas or other
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
things like that we're just talking
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
about your your car dealerships so
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
statutorily it was just narrow to only
 
00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
car dealers who have to pay this $50 a
 
00:25:14.909 --> 00:25:14.919 align:start position:0%
year uh registration
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
fee the those are the folks that have to
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
license to the department and we
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
regulate them because they're working
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
with the consumers on the financing
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
applications and and so the the law
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
requires those folks to be licensed with
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
us okay great are there any other
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
questions so I guess guess I'll have to
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
pay attention of that 610 Square I don't
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
know how have to figure out to do that
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
chair person chairperson hunt
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative U MC mckel has had his
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
hand up for quite a
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
while really I I don't I don't see it on
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
my screen here but go ahead um a a
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
question uh m doino how do how do you
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
defined a Family
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
Trust what what exactly how far down the
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
line does that go so a Family Trust
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
Company is a specific type of Trust
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
Company um that I'm going to pull up the
 
00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:14.919 align:start position:0%
law right now just so I'm not going to
 
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
misspeak um and I can give you the
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
actual definition but these are trust
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
companies that are formed by a family um
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
in order to manage the wealth of that
 
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
family um so let me see here hang on
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
just a second I'm going to give you the
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
official statutory
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
definition which I'm sure is going to be
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
incredibly clear to
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
everyone give you a little Side Story uh
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
represent so this is actually one of our
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
Le newest of our trust different kind of
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
trust legislation um many many years ago
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
um I sponsored the original trust
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
statute uh and uh so that we bring to
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
bring us competitively to other states
 
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of how we have our banking our
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
Bank and Trust TR law set up um over the
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
years different things have created and
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
these these new family trusts are a new
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a new item um and we we we
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
created a study committee because we
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that uh how we
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
were regulating them and how we were
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
feing their fees were is done correctly
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
and some of this legislation is actually
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
driven by that study committee um but uh
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
but um you can go ahead now
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me attorney doino
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
so when un fortunately the definition is
 
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
not helpful at all um a Family Trust
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
Company is a trust company that is
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
organized organized under the laws of
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
this state and authorized to engage in
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
members they don't interact with the
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
public um and you have to be related by
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
a certain number of degrees to the
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
family member that creates the Trust
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
Company um generally these Family Trust
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
companies are really only practical for
 
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
folks with very significant wealth um
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be setting up a
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
Family Trust Company you know unless you
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
have well unless you win the lottery or
 
00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of money let's put it
 
00:28:25.039 --> 00:28:26.029 align:start position:0%
have a whole lot of money let's put it
that

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
way and then you know this was some
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
country because said it wasn't that
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
they're necessarily going to be New
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens and that we were
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
going to draw you know H out but they
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
draw more wealth to the state of
 
00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:39.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we could be taxable and
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
interested in so this uh they brought up
 
00:28:43.509 --> 00:28:43.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of different issues around this
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
this particular subject the Family Trust
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
um so we certainly can spend a little
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
more time in helping you get your arms
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
around it um but yes go ahead for the
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
question oh so in other words if if I'm

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
like a uh the radio talk show to keep
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%

00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
Department Bill and we'll hear from
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
Kiera Delino again um uh and who will
 
00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
and present the bill for us thank you so
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
the written testimony I provided you a
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
follows the same format as the prior
 
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:20.840 align:start position:0%
bill um hb610 I've pasted from the bill
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh analysis the Roman numerals that are
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
found there and then provided some
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
further clarification and identified the
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
bills sections affected so um HP 312 is
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
what we would call our clarifications
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
bill it applies to both uh the
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
provisions herein apply to both
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
chartered and licensed entities um and
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
we're making adjustments that we feel
 
00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
will help clarify existing statutes make
 
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
them less confusing um help formalize
 
00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
long-standing interpretation of our laws
 
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
or will eliminate Provisions that are
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
obsolete or
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so um to go through each of
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
the sections um the first part of the
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
bill sections 1 through five and then
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
section 13 at the end are amendments
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
that will help further um clarify the
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
deadlines that apply to examinations of
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
our Consumer Credit
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
licenses um currently the law as written
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
is not that clear so we've proposed
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
amendments to make the deadlines for
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
those folks to submit documents and
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
information to us more clear and to give
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
them a slightly longer period of time to
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
provide that information we're also
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
asking for a slight change to um chapter
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
399 G which applies to money
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
transmitters so that the provisions
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
related to production of documents and
 
00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
examinations mirror the other Consumer
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
Credit chapters for some reason uh the
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
provisions were sort of out of
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
sequence um in section six we're asking
 
00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
for a change um that's been necessitated
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
by covid uh with covid we have mortgage
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
loan Originators who are now teleworking
 
00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:04.919 align:start position:0%
from their personal residents Uh current
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
law may requ seem to require them to be
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
licensed in their state of residence
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
even if they're not working with
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
consumers in that state uh so we want to
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
amend the law so that they're not
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
required to be licensed in their home
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
state if they're working from
 
00:34:22.589 --> 00:34:22.599 align:start position:0%
home section seven applies to Family
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
Trust companies um currently we examine
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
all chartered instit institutions uh
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
Family Trust companies banks credit
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
unions Etc we have specific Provisions
 
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
that state the commissioner can examine
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
entities more frequently than every 36
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
months or whatever the applicable time
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
frame is um we are asking to have the
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
same language added for the Family Trust
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
Company examinations we think it was
 
00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:50.679 align:start position:0%
just an oversight that they weren't in
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
there um and so this will bring those
 
00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
folks in line with the other chartered
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
institutions next in sections 8 through1
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
we're asking for clarification that
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
depository Banks can elect to operate as
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
a benefit Corporation under
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
293c we have currently two banks that
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
have elected that status and we just
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
want to incorporate um clear language in
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
the statute to authorize
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
that in section 11 we're having asking
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
for clarifications to the provisions
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
that apply to credit unions and um the
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
Del ation by Credit Union boards to
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
committees we just want to clarify that
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
um the the the credit union board still
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
has an obligation to oversee the work of
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
the committee and review minutes um
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
these Provisions that we're seeking are
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
identical to the ones that already exist
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
in laws applicable to
 
00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:50.839 align:start position:0%
Banks and then finally in section 12 um
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is a change that we requested back
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 session in hb1
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
1437 um and they adjust the restrictions
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
that apply to just the commissioner and
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner as to the types of
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
loans and other Financial transactions
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
that they can engage in um we want to
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
modernize our existing law so it
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
conforms to um you know the state ethics
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
code that's now in place um essentially
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
it would allow um our commissioner
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner to finance a loan to
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
purchase a vehicle a mortgage on their
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
home Etc as long as those mortgage and
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
those other Financial transactions are
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
all um consistent with the ethics
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
requirements and are done in the normal
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
course of
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
business so those are all the provisions
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
in this bill HB 312 and I'm happy to
 
00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:43.800 align:start position:0%

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
questions okay uh so if you want to ask
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
a question please raise your hand oh

Chrissy was there but not uh okay re
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.270 align:start position:0%
 
hton

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
hton
 
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh you you do I have to unmute I'm all
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
said thank you very much and thank you
 
00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:05.079 align:start position:0%
attorney doino I have just a couple of
 
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
quick questions one is just a
 
00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:10.599 align:start position:0%
grammatical question I guess um I'm
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
looking at Roman
 
00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.550 align:start position:0%
looking at Roman
4

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
4
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
2B that's on page two of the document
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
that I have uh it begins failure to
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
provide files and
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
documents and it appears that there's
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
been an effort throughout this to change
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
that and that and
 
00:37:36.349 --> 00:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
or right um the request that goes out um
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
lensee uh sometimes asks for them to
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
provide actual documents sometimes it
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
asks them to ask them to to provide
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
consumer loan files and other similar
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
files um those are terms of art with our
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
examiners and with our lienes so we
 
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to try to make make it clear um
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
that it's or not and for those types of
 
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
documents or files followup please
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
further question may inquire so I I'm
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that that and should be changed
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
to or based upon what you've just said
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
am I correct yes and we did I thought we
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
did attempt to make those changes in all
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
the sections affected thank you followup
 
00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
please yes for the question in the last
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
section on Bank commissioner
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
qualifications I I know we've had
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
legislation that that talked about this
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the past but I still would just like
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
to mention my concerns about the
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
qualification that includes um fails to
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
become resident of the state within one
 
00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
year after his or her appointment I
 
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
still see that as something that's very
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
difficult to follow up on and to make
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we have ascertained that uh
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
after a commissioner is named so that's
 
00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
just a comment about something that I'm
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with that I've always been
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with thank
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
you I would say in my 30 some years Bank
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner has always been
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
a resident so I guess this issue has
 
00:39:02.309 --> 00:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
never come up but
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
um fair enough uh you can put your I'll
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
put your hand down for you
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh okay is there anybody else okay uh
 
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
Max representative abon has a question
 
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
don't can you folks hear me yes we can
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
um how would this bill if past affect uh
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
um individuals who have uh see business
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
or a home in a Family Trust are they
 
00:39:32.309 --> 00:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
going to be affected by
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
this um I the only provision that would
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
really affect the Family Trust Company
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
is the provision where we're asking to
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
allow the commissioner to examine more
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
frequently than every 36 months if if
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
it's deemed necessary in current law the
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner can open an investigation
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
and conduct what we call a visitation at
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
any time so in Practical terms the
 
00:39:58.829 --> 00:39:58.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner does have auth to step in
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
if if something arises that causes
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
concern and conduct essentially the
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
equivalent of an examination of that
 
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
Family Trust Company so um that would be
 
00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
the only provision in here that would
 
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:13.960 align:start position:0%
directly affect a Family Trust Company
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
and again we think that under current
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
law essentially the same process could
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
occur yeah I I think I I know where
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
you're going with this maack so I as a
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
as a as a trust fund baby myself um I
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
there it is the word trust fund is
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
probably a misnomer here um yes these
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
are called trusts but but they're
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with uh your you know
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
trust funds that that those of us um who
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
are fortunate to have um they they're
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
not affected by this legislation
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
whatsoever is that is that where your
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
going oh my question is not going
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
anywhere it's an open question oh okay
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
so do you do you feel satisfied or do
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
you have another question or followup no
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine okay great all right is
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
there anybody else looking for hands I
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
get I know the hands are supposed to pop
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
to the top but I don't know how I'm I
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
missed okay uh seeing no other
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions um and before I close the
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
hearing I will then read from the blue
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
sheet and we do have a couple more
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
people from the banking Department uh
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
ring shoot uh shoot was is in support of
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
the bill from the banking department and
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
Nancy Deo also from the banking
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
department is in support of the bill uh
 
00:41:36.069 --> 00:41:36.079 align:start position:0%
and with that if there's nobody else
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
wants to speak we will close the public
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
312 okay so now I'm ahead of schedule
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
but I just Mr yes I just wondered if
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
everybody understood how to raise their
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
hand uh yeah is everybody is there
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
everybody does everybody understand how
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
to do that there's a taskar on the
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
bottom okay con Connie just Connie was
 
00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
testing us yes she put her hand up again
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
yes yes question yes okay so Connie
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
knows how to do it yes yes represent V
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I just want to ask um I
 
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
guess a point of order question yes how
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
do we go about submitting amendments now
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
that we do not have access fair fair
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
question okay so um I would ask
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
certainly this bill well the first one
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
we did and the next one we're about to
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
do are our two early
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
bills so those ones we want to get out
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
out of the committee in a timely fashion
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
I have actually scheduled every Bill
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
already on a on a on a per day basis but
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
that um I until they give me or give
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
give us a second day rather than just
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays because if we only met on
 
00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays we would not be able to make
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
make their deadlines so we actually do
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
need another day of the week um and I'm
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
told that that there is a possibility we
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
won't get it for next week but we could
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
get it the following week so in that's
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
in any case what I did was in scheduling
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
bills is I put in an exec session uh at
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
1:15 so after lunch we would exact and
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
it's really 15 to 30 minutes um I'll be
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
frank with everyone if we get too deep
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
into needing to amend a bill or process
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
of a bill um then then um I will be
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
urging everybody to just retain the bill
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll take that up in in September
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
to really do our you know what this com
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
this committee has known for which is
 
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
get down and dirty and in subcommittee
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
having said that um I would urge um
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
anyone who uh in terms of any bills we
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
he if there is issues that you're you
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
care about or want to work on I would
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
urge you to contact me to let me
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
know that you have an amendment for it
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
or you would like to do an amendment or
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
you want to do talk about it so at that
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
point I can then plan in terms of
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
scheduling how we want to handle that
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
concern and like I say if it's you know
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
let's say if you just want to remove the
 
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
residency requirement okay that's a
 
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward Amendment um we
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
could take that up at the time we are um
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh executing the bill because that's
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward simple you know
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
concept um if we if we want to if we get
 
00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:26.680 align:start position:0%
into a big long discussion and it's
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
clearly the committee is really torn on
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
it then I'll just say okay well let's
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
just retain the bill then and and work
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
work on it next year so I would hope
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
that when there if there are a little
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
minor tweaks and that and um that we can
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
fix the bill with um and again it's
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
become make me aware of it that you
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
you're concerned then I'll just have to
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
make sure I schedule time and figure out
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
how and how we can accomplish that does
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
that make
 
00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
sense yes go ahead follow please no
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um and I think
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
there's that one little glitch of and
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
should be or for one thing and I am
 
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
considering that residency requirement
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
um and and just wondering about that
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
however what would be the procedure that
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
I would have to go through just to
 
00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
inform you I don't have to go through
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
OSS and get a a drafted amendment to
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
bring forward well I mean informing me
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
would mean we have a conversation and
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
I'll try to talk you out of it or I try
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
to make sure I understand what your
 
00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
issue is at that point um if it if it
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
does seem appropriate to have an
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
amendment drawn up then and I would
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
discuss it and we would then tell Pam
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
who just made herself visual Vis that uh
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
that we would have that Amendment drawn
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
up so that we would take it up when
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're executing the bill so did you want
 
00:45:41.549 --> 00:45:41.559 align:start position:0%
to comment Pam yeah I thought I would
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
just add in it the process that was
 
00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
actually established last year or maybe
 
00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
even the year before where um ask ol at
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
le. state. n. us is is the process that
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
they started using you know before the
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic for submitting information
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
about um you know Amendment requests and
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
um mailing them back to you you know
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
emailing them back to you so we had
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
stopped the paper pickup process um and
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
so that will continue ask
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
OLS at l.st do. us Works notifying you
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
know asking me to help out absolutely
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
and and um conversations with the chair
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
so he knows what's going on all all
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
sense so I'm saying Connie that that if
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
you know obviously I'll you know
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
generate an opinion one way or the other
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
about the amendment but that the process
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
now is that we would then go through OS
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
and they would then email the amendment
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
to all the members and and um and then
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
we can figure out how we want to how we
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
want to dub tail it into the bill or
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
not okay maybe we can talk offline about
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
those two little glitchy things uh thank
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
you for the input and Pam thank you as
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
well thought all I thought the and or
 
00:46:59.390 --> 00:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
they got on all but you're saying there
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
was one of them they didn't get there
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
was one and right it's I'm looking page
 
00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
two line 15 yeah see you I don't have
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
those sheets I had to print mine
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
out okay but I know I see failure to
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
provide there's the one in deleted it's
 
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
the the new B in the middle of my page
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
that the first words are failure to
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
provide files and documents oh see on
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
mine mine the an is crossed
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
out really and I printed mine offline I
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
mean from from what's
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
online but am I I looking so after two
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
which is delivered to commissioner files
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
B failure to provide files and is
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
crossed out and says or documents within
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
time established by this paragraph s
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
subject a license year person to a fine
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
of $50 per day for each
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
day and and under Roman four I think
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's line Roman four is all crossed
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
out okay so now going down Roman 4 and
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying in the B of Roman four two
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
2 B 2B failure to provide files and do
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
with in the time establish by subject
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
turns into a fine of $50 per day after
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
20 each day the
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
files or documents are are not produced
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
so after you get the after 21 days is
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
deleted right
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
well but you have at the very beginning
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
of B failure to provide files and and
 
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
document okay I got okay so so yes so
 
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll have we'll have that
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh that that that Amendment
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
drawn up so Pam will take care of that
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
already Pam will Pam know knows about it
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
so she will make sure she'll take care
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
of it right Pam right just remove just
 
00:48:56.789 --> 00:48:56.799 align:start position:0%
changing that one and to an or yeah
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
sorry I was looking at the wrong place
 
00:49:01.109 --> 00:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
so that's the downside of not having
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
having the bills as printed from
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
the okay uh and I would just add Mr
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
chairman that one one reason is that not
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
all the bills were sent out was that not
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
all of them have come back from the
 
00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:17.799 align:start position:0%
print shop yet okay so the scheduling
 
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:19.559 align:start position:0%
happened faster than the printing in
 
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
some cases and
 
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:26.440 align:start position:0%
um that's unfortunate right well I I
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
find myself I couldn't I couldn't be and
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
begin to scheduling bills until I had
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
printed out and as you remember P Pam in
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
the past in the old days I used to have
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
to lay them all out and figure out where
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
I G to do to match them up so okay
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative emam has a question yeah
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
I just have a technical question this is
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
my first time on the committee my first
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
time clerking yes and so what I'm
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
finding is there are terms that I'm not
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with and it takes me a little
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
while to process it so I can think about
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
what I'm supposed to type okay uh is
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
there a way we could slow things down a
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
um what do I do if I fall behind and I
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
and I need to catch up uh you just have
 
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
to you can just say Mr chair please hold
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
pause for a second um I I would say that
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
um that we're most of our bills won't
 
00:50:20.549 --> 00:50:20.559 align:start position:0%
have these kind of technical language
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
and when we do the department bills and
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I guess we do have the insurance
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
department so they might get into the
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
same problem you know some uh but I I
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
will urge them to try to be when we get
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
to the insurance bills to the department
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
I'll tell them to tr to make sure that
 
00:50:36.990 --> 00:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
we slow down when with new Concepts that
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
members of the committee might not be
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with right just to explain you
 
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
know what an acronym might mean or what
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
a certain term might me um that would be

see what was said so you can do that
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
again also yeah great can't can't wait
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
to listen to the whole thing all over
 
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.670 align:start position:0%
to listen to the whole thing all over
you

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh representative Abramson has
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
his hand up yes yes I just have a
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
comment it's it's on that fine it's on
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
page two and it's also on page three
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
line two and another on page three line
 
00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:40.119 align:start position:0%
25 and so forth I'm just noticing the
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's just a $50 a day fine um and if
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're taking away that 21 day you know
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
after 21 days that looks like it'd be
 
00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:49.190 align:start position:0%
after 21 days that looks like it'd be
about

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
$1,000 increase in in what people are
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
being fine but um the first thought that
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
comes to mind when I look at find for
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
credit unions and Banks and business and
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
whatnot is is this going to be born out
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
disproportionately on small business
 
00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
versus Big Business um big business and
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
big companies sometimes will see a
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
really small fine on something and
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
they'll just totally just they'll
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
disregard the rule and just pay the pay
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
the fine every single day um but small
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
businesses and startups and people
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get uh get a brand new say
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
Credit Union um established uh they
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
don't have uh millions of dollars
 
00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
sitting in the bank so to speak to uh to
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
cover they better they better have
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in the
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
bank we uh both banking Insurance the
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
most important thing you need to know
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
under these institution is
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
solvency so we that's what their our
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
departments are making sure that they
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
are truly solvent and then that that
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
they can afford to do business so um
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
that's a critical item um I I you nobody
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
wants to drag out uh waiting to deal to
 
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
respond to the banking Department I I
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that this happens very often
 
00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
so but I I hear your concern you know
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
let's make sure we don't hurt the the
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
little credit unions or the little Banks
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
but um believe in me they're they're all
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
in this together and they they want to
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
respond to the department as quickly as
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
possible at any rate uh we can certainly
 
00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:23.720 align:start position:0%
think about that one uh is there anybody
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
else no I don't see any other in so
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
we'll close the public hearing on 3:12
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to write that Keith
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
write the time down I don't know if I
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
did yeah I've been keeping up with that
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
okay so we can close that now I guess
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
officially and then we have four minutes
 
00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
before the next hearing so uh we can
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
take a a pause unless anybody has any
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
other questions they'd like to ask me
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah representative um hunt Mr chairman
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes go Jane uh representative Bo
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
you're here um I I will be um leaving at
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
11: for a dentist appointment and then
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'll be back this afternoon but we'll
 
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
have to um leave at roughly about
 
00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
2:15 okay I had some appointments that I
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
couldn't resched I I and I'm sure then
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
gonna so no we're uh you know we
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
understand everybody comes and goes and
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's so feel comfortable
 
00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
would say is um that that having that if
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
if someone wants to make sure they can
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
you can certainly U send a text to me
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
and my tech my phone number is on the
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
web page so anybody feel free to text me
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
if they want me to know that why they're
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
they're leaving um and obviously if
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
you're if your if your name disappears
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
from the screen then you're obviously
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
not in the room and uh but that um I
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
would ask people that if you do get up
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh to leave you know do turn your camera
 
00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
off so you know we don't see necessarily
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
see an empty seat but um you know just
 
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
you know that how feel free to turn the
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
camera off um especially if you're
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
getting up from your seat sometimes you
 
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
know we it might be best that we didn't
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
see see what pants you were wearing that
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
day but um and should we leave should we
 
00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:14.200 align:start position:0%
leave the meeting and then um log back
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
in uh once we get back um that's
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
probably the best thing to do okay I
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
think that's yeah uh because it's better
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
better for me to know you're not around
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
rather than see your name then go call
 
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:26.799 align:start position:0%
for you when you're not there and yeah
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's probably best so I'll take
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
attendance for each bill based on no I
 
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't worry about that I I think the
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
attendance is just them you know morning
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
in but but we know full well that people
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
can come and go with attendance so the
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
form that the the house clerk gave me
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
has uh it has like an attendance uh list
 
00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:47.799 align:start position:0%
for each bill really yeah I don't know
 
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
Pam am I really supposed are we supposed
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
to roll call it for each bill no that's
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
yeah not roll call but uh it says
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
he he said to like all the names are in
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
bold unbold the members names who were
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
not present and that's on each form for
 
00:56:05.559 --> 00:56:06.710 align:start position:0%
not present and that's on each form for
each

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
bill Mr chair when I did the clerking I
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
did just visually update the the names
 
00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
that were on the bill so that I I
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
actually did take attendance for each
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
individ that is true when we we would
 
00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
always Circle when we were when we were
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
having a hearing we would Circle who was
 
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
there but no that's what it was for so
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah so that if the person is you
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if you need to take a
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
roll call but
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
um yeah maybe maybe could could you let
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
me know uh yes I I let me follow up on
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
that to find out because you're not a
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
host so you wouldn't
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily but you're you can see all
 
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
the people who are there
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%
right panelist right but I can see the
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
list of panelists I I can see a very
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
long list that I'll have to you know
 
00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
sort through depending on how many
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
people are on call yeah right because
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
well everybody should have rep next to
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
their name so so yeah so so when you
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
start when we started hearing your
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
theoretically you should uh you know
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
Circle or in the old days we would
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
Circle it on the clerk's sheet but but
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
to to identify who's here who's not here
 
00:57:10.079 --> 00:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
to to identify who's here who's not here
so

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay I I think doing that I I'll miss
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
some testimony but if uh people if
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
people could just let me know that
 
00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:20.039 align:start position:0%
they're leaving that would also be
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%

charge consumers for Pap billing has and
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
was brought to my attention by a
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
constituent who is retired in my
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
district I shared this constituent's
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
concern about how those fees penalize
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
people on a fixed income families
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%

simply uncomfortable with the risk of
 
00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%
putting their financial information
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
online the pandemic has even made

household finances even harder for many
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%

increasing numbers of companies that

that their checking account balance will
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
be enough to cover one or more monthly
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
be charged more as a result of opting
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
for a paper bill I suggest if committee
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
members can contacted their own
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
constituents on this question they would
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
find a similar result this pandemic has
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
brought forth many studies and statistic
 
01:02:22.549 --> 01:02:22.559 align:start position:0%
statistics on how many people do not do
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
not have adequate internet service on
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
article in the New Hampshire Business
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
Review stated that 45 to 55% of people
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
in many communities in New Hampshire
 
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
said they internet service was not
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
adequate for their
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
needs you might also be thinking of
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
environment and that avoiding paper
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
billing saves trees truthfully a
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
minority of New Hampshire residents will
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
likely opt in for this
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
service an infot Trend study showed
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
about 25% of people will op in for the
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
paper they do this for a certain type of
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
bills such as medical bills where
 
01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
privacy is important and for other bills
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
not for all of them we should be
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
thinking of those who need the service
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
once your private records are on the
 
01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
internet and perhaps fall into the wrong
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
hands are compro compromised or hacked
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
into it can take years to repair your
 
01:03:26.589 --> 01:03:26.599 align:start position:0%
credit history and you might suffer
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
identity theft and never feel quite safe
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
again having an alternative option for
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents is ideal
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
finances are not the only reason for
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
opting for paper often is for privacy
 
01:03:45.269 --> 01:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
reasons as the case of those who wants
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
to keep their medical records private my
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
informal research show that a number of
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
thriving New Hampshire utilities which
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
are which are of course in a different
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
category such as eversource and TDS
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
Telecom do not charge extra for paper
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
billing they understand the needs this
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
also tells me that they likely face no
 
01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
substantial hardship from continuing to
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
offer customers their own free choice
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
when it comes to billing method without
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
charging a penalties I hope you like I
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
hope you will keep those points in mind
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
and choose to vote in favor of the house
 
01:04:28.069 --> 01:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
will 7 6 FN and act prohibiting paper
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
billing fees it's a very simple step we
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
can take in a bipar and way to provide a
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
great and necessary benefit to our
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
that seem to be becoming a greater
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
problem are more people charging for
 
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
those who pay by mail
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
yes that is one of the reasons that I'm
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
proposing this bill because um a lot of
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
our constituents are been seeing some
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
additional fees when they are requesting
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
a um paper
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
billing but followup please yes for the
 
01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
question in is that also true um when
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
they send mailin payments they're being
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
charged for those in other words if I
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
send a a a payment of $50 in that is
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
that I'm Drew am I going to be charged
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
should Fe on top of
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
that I don't think I understand the
 
01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:02.119 align:start position:0%
question right but if you are asking for
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
a paper Bill to send out to you and
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's basically they are charging you
 
01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.789 align:start position:0%
that's basically they are charging you
for

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
it follow I'm just looking at the
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
analysis that says for paying by mail
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
and I I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
read the analysis but but you're
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
concerned that you're in in the actual
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
language of the bill that there's a fee
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
being charged for paying uh through
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
through mailing it back rather than okay
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
so we you know let's we'll dig into that
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
but I would not wa you know lay on the
 
01:06:35.069 --> 01:06:35.079 align:start position:0%
analysis you know analysis can be
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
confusing sometimes so that is in the
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
bill though so it is in the bill okay
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're electing to make a payment by
 
01:06:44.789 --> 01:06:44.799 align:start position:0%
United States mail or electing to
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
make so so they back dilling you for
 
01:06:49.109 --> 01:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
that I don't know that a good question I
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
don't know okay uh are you all set any
 
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
more questions I do have one other
 
01:06:56.190 --> 01:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
question um do you see any problem with
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
the enforcement Clause that is included
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
here uh given that the Department of
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
Justice will be responsible for this and
 
01:07:06.269 --> 01:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
there are some heavy duty fines that are
 
01:07:06.279 --> 01:07:07.390 align:start position:0%
there are some heavy duty fines that are
levied

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
levied
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
here I don't see any problem with that
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
um I have um spoken with a lawyer and
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
about this to make sure that um
 
01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
businesses are not taking advantage of
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
it so making sure that it's been heavily
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
um put the fine in there so that way if
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
a cons consumer opts in for a paper and
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
so that way they cannot charge it and
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
for that matter we are trying to protect
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
our uh you um citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
who is desperate for their paper
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
Billings rather than um letting them to
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
um be fined I mean uh been charged for a
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
fee so having this heavy um fee I think
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
would be uh beneficial to kind of
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
convince the businesses to let the uh
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
choice for the consumers thank you very
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
much yeah so I would interject before I
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
take more questions just to make sure
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
everybody understands this is um under
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
3505 uh9 uh which is uh follow under the
 
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
consumer protection statutes um and uh
 
01:08:13.349 --> 01:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
so just so everybody knows um
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
technically technically um in actuality
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh any financial institutions Banks um
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
Securities uh insurance and um uh public
 
01:08:28.269 --> 01:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
utility commissions are Exempted from
 
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
this statute so if it's a utility or if
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's a bank that's charging for the
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
statement they would be exempt from this
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
legislation okay so next up is
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
Anita Bros represent Bros yes thanks for
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for taking
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
my question it's just a quick one um I'm
 
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
just curious why is the term person use
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
in the bill rather than corporate entity
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
and because it's saying that persons
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
will be Char you know will be fine so
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know why is it not a corporate
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
entity because individuals penalties
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
they'll have both they'll say person and
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
then they'll
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
say uh a person
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
fine yeah um I guess under 358 then then
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
terms of if there's somewhere else where
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
it talks about a person being a business
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
then it's um that's correct Mr chairman
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that in under um yeah
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
statutory construction
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
lawed as a corporation as well as an
 
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
individual Thank you Pam this is great
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
having you here right behind
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
me okay uh and any other questions you
 
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
also said Nita okay uh representative
 
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
aberson is
 
01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
next uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
representative Wy for taking my um
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
question I'm noticing that you've
 
01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
this yes I have exam Ed state agencies
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
due to um to be honest with you um um I
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
think we the state itself needs the
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
revenues and um according to what I
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
heard from the last um year testimony
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
that they bring forth um about 7
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
$775,000 I believe in revenues according
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
to that so um I think the state of New
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs the revenue so I make
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
sure that we exempt
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
that so um
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
question you may inquire I'm sorry
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
follow say can I have a yeah yeah go go
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
ahead so I it just seems like it's a the
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh the state applying rules to certain
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
types of businesses and then exempting
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
itself and for pretty hefty fines $500
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
on the first offense which is um pretty
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
significant for a small business or a
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
startup and then 5,000 for a second
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
offense I think we'd see a lot more of
 
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
the $500 First Defense um penalties
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
that's quite a bit of money um and then
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
on top of that somebody's going to be
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
asking me the question when they get hit
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
with this um Can the state uh charge you
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
an extra fee for trying to pay that $500
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
fine by
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
mail I mean first of all if if this bill
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
passes through uh and becomes a law and
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
um those businesses should be
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
considering in following the law so if
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
they really want to pay that $500 then
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
they can charge the consumer and you
 
01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
know uh take it take it up to the court
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
so um it's better off for them not to
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
charge that $2 fee and not get fined so
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
that is the exception of this to um
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
follow the rule or not to follow the
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
rule okay you the question Max yeah
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
follow up is is there um there are all
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
sorts of different types of
 
01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
businesses um every time we come up with
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
a fee or a fine or regulation there's
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
always some new startup that hits all
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
the Reg regulations that we come up with
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
for existing established businesses that
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
we know of um and you may have a
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
business that provides some type of
 
01:12:06.669 --> 01:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
Internet service or Internet billing
 
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
service and for them the cost of
 
01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.070 align:start position:0%
service and for them the cost of
processing

01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
processing
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
paper um you know paper bills like these
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
oops like we don't we don't you're not
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to show things
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
oh um their cost of process
 
01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:29.719 align:start position:0%
uh by paper could be as much as $20 per
 
01:12:34.110 --> 01:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
um bill um so they may um set up
 
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
something that's done exclusively
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
through online billing but then if they
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to make a slight change um and
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
except for an exceptional circumstance
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
um their their processing cost could be
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
very high are they supposed to just eat
 
01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
the processing cost
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
themselves thanks for that question um
 
01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
um representative evson as you can see
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
this this is not new okay so um
 
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
companies has done providing mailin
 
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
bills previously and as we are just
 
01:13:08.189 --> 01:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
moving with technology it's become a of
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
of a new thing for uh online billing or
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
online payment so um like I said earlier
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
on my testimony that very little
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
majority of our uh New Hampshire
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
citizens could pop poed into this so
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
there won't be too much of a a big
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
burden for the businesses it's just
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
allowing an option for our individuals
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
to opt in or to stay in as of um you
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
know opt in for the paper or pay online
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
so just giving that option for
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
individuals would be good um just like
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
our state moto Live Free or
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you uh Mr chairman um
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
I I too was wondering um part two
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
nothing uh in this applies to
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies along the same
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
lines um does that include all
 
01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies towns and and you
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
know there there are many types of
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies and many types of
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
consumers or folks that are paying bills
 
01:14:19.350 --> 01:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
and their ability to do so on the
 
01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
internet so I was just wondering if this
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
applies to all of them including
 
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities yes all the um um New
 
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um businesses that are
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
state okay and representative
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
Terry uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative wasir and um colleagues
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
on the committee I want to make clear
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm in an investigatory or inquiry
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
mode here so my question should not be
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
taken as indicating any position at this
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
point on your proposed legislation I'll
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
be the judge of that excuse me I said I
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
will be the judge of of your question
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
because I might say to you would you
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
believe if I decide that your question
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
was not a question go
 
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
ahead uh clearly and indisputably I
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
think we're we can consider the charges
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
that are levied to pay uh to receive a
 
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
paper Bill uh to be a kind of user
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
fee um if in fact we prohibit any
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
charges for levying such a user fee then
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's going to have to
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
pay and the people who are going to have
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
to pay are the people who are paying uh
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
electronically it have you given any
 
01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:54.679 align:start position:0%
consideration to um how those who opt to
 
01:15:54.679 --> 01:15:55.590 align:start position:0%
consideration to um how those who opt to
pay

01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
electronically would be
 
01:15:59.950 --> 01:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
protected if your
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation is to was to pass protected
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
in the sense that they would not end up
 
01:16:08.629 --> 01:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
having to pay for the people who are
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
choosing to uh continue to pay um via
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
the traditional old method of paper
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
billing is that a question Mr chairman
 
01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
that's a question thank
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
you well thank you uh representative
 
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
Terry that is a similar question to the
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
previous um answer that I I gave um but
 
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's obviously the businesses already
 
01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
have done providing paper billing
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
previous years um before like five years
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
ago seven years ago before we came into
 
01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.270 align:start position:0%
ago seven years ago before we came into
this

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
technology um no you will not be charged
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
extra for those who are opt in you know
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
opt in for um online banking you will
 
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
pay your your share and um it will be it
 
01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
will be a a great um thing for the
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
business to provide for those who are
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
wants to be opting for
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
paper so it will not make any um it will
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
not make additional fees for your um
 
01:17:15.629 --> 01:17:15.639 align:start position:0%
your perspective if you I think what
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
he's pling is is that that that that if
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
a business would intend that there's a
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
certain amount of percentage of people
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
who will pay the fee and if all of a
 
01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
sudden they're not getting that fee
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
anymore then they're going to pass on
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
that cost whatever Revenue they thought
 
01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
they were going to get that they're
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
going to pass that cost uh it's going to
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
offset some costs they're going to pass
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
that cost on to everybody so therefore
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
the rest of us who really are still
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
paying electronically are subsidizing
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
this benefit for those who can't afford
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
it well I don't have an answer to that
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair but um it does come up a
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
question for me if if the businesses
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
were able to provide hard cop Cy of a
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
statement or billing previous years many
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
years ago um how they were covering
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
their charges you know how they were
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
coming out with those uh extra charges
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
that they are now putting on our
 
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
consumers so I would like to know that
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
answer what if a businesses well I can
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
venture to give you an answer to that
 
01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
one just like in the old days Airlines
 
01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
never charge for luggage and now they do
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
and what's happened is is that they
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
lowered their ticket
 
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
prices but then added fees so I think
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
what representative Terry is going with
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
this is the exact same thing that if you
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
are removing the fee collection
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
therefore there will have to raise their
 
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
prices for whatever product they're
 
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
selling to offset that lost
 
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue well I don't have that answer to
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair representative Terry was I
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
was I on the Mark or not well well Mr
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
chairman I was actually gonna follow up
 
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
with uh questions that would have St
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
been stated uh in a very similar manner
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
but I would like to uh thank you for
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
what did not anticipate to be a tag team
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
on this question and uh thank you for um
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
saying what I didn't have to say you're
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
asking what I didn't have to ask thank
 
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
you very much you read my mind okay
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
next thank you representative for uh
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony I want to make sure that
 
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm clear on on one issue I believe uh
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh that this bill while it would
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
prohibit additional fees for for someone
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
who transacts business by paper or mail
 
01:19:42.189 --> 01:19:42.199 align:start position:0%
um would not prohibit a business from
 
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
offering a
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
discount uh or rebate for uh for
 
01:19:52.950 --> 01:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
electing to uh to make an electronic
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
trans that correct doesn't it it the
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
business still has the right to give an
 
01:20:01.550 --> 01:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
incentive to someone who goes electronic
 
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.070 align:start position:0%
incentive to someone who goes electronic
and

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
discounts correct you are correct thank
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
you and Mr chair I'll end my questions
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
from here uh I would like to leave to

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%

FN
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
um I I believe that uh the invoicing is
 
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
an expected usual and basic
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility of a business relating
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
their charges for services and goods to
 
01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:52.870 align:start position:0%
their charges for services and goods to
their

01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
customers and as a matter of customer
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
service should be done in the medium and
 
01:22:03.229 --> 01:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
the usually expected ways that uh we're
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
C accustomed to receiving now we are on
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
the threshold
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
of electronics or internet but there are
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
many people out there that do not have
 
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
many people out there that do not have
that

01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
capability um or it's intermittent in
 
01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.229 align:start position:0%
capability um or it's intermittent in
its

01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness um and many people while
 
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:25.719 align:start position:0%
they do have the cap ability and are
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
involved with computers um in my
 
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
experience they're they're not often
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
looking at their obligations or their
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
emails I've got a case where in in other
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
venues and
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
organizations I'm almost at the point of
 
01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
um de disusing emails because nobody's
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
reading them um and and that's a problem
 
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
because people miss things and they
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
could be missing their their billing
 
01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh if they don't go on to the vendor's
 
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
website or um look at the vendor's email
 
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
that contains an invoice so I think it's
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
an unfair thing to expect um ubiquitous
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
observation of emails and
 
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.550 align:start position:0%
observation of emails and
websites

01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
websites
 
01:23:18.070 --> 01:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing the the effect of more
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
and more companies and financial
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
institution Banks uh wanting to convert
 
01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
to Green paperless and that's a good
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
thing but that has to be for those
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
people who want that and are capable of
 
01:23:35.669 --> 01:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
doing it that should not be forced upon
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh the general consumer um and
 
01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:40.239 align:start position:0%
especially not those people who don't
 
01:23:43.229 --> 01:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
have the capability or or don't have the
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
management capability to uh to Monitor
 
01:23:49.709 --> 01:23:49.719 align:start position:0%
and keep up with uh all the many bills
 
01:23:52.030 --> 01:23:52.040 align:start position:0%
that could come electronically and then
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
of course when the electronic means fail
 
01:23:58.440 --> 01:23:58.450 align:start position:0%
for hurricanes or storms or
 
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.750 align:start position:0%
for hurricanes or storms or
[Music]

01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
out so there's also that Spectre of fees
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
late fees for missing or late turn in of
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh of the payment on these bills so I'm
 
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this and and this is
 
01:24:20.990 --> 01:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
like a preemptive defense against um a
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
movement towards uh removing paper from
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
um from the culture and the Commerce
 
01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
that and I think we do need to have the
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
paper um and for those that that can't
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
use or don't want to use the other
 
01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
capability that we're developing
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
electronically and I guess that
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
summarizes um my feeling of support uh
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
for hb76 FN thank you all right thank
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
you uh do we have questions yeah
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative gson you have a
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
question yeah I I I thank you Mr
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and maybe uh because you
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
addressed this a little bit earlier um
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
when you said that according to statute
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
there are actually some uh entities that
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from this legislation
 
01:25:12.350 --> 01:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
anyway uh am I understanding this
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
correctly that uh Banks would be exempt
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh the utilities would be exempt from
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
this we we already I'm I'm I know that
 
01:25:23.109 --> 01:25:23.119 align:start position:0%
the state would be exempt and I
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh towns and counties
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
would be exempt so who exactly would
 
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:30.920 align:start position:0%
this apply to I I Bob's Garage
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
what thank you anticipating that a large
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
number of people um and who who use uh
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
anything from
 
01:25:44.590 --> 01:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh from the local garage or or uh
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
vendors or
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
contractors uh that come into the home
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
um there's a whole array of businesses
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
out there um that that you could lump
 
01:25:59.310 --> 01:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
into that'll still use the paper billing
 
01:26:03.109 --> 01:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
with a good and a good effect uh in
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
relating to their customers for the
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
charges for the the services and the
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
goods that they they provide um I I
 
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:13.719 align:start position:0%
would prefer that uh those exempt
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
organizations would also respect um
 
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
people's inability to um deal with the
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
internet and continue a paper billing on
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
a courtesy if not on on an obligatory uh
 
01:26:29.629 --> 01:26:29.639 align:start position:0%
fashion um I think that's just good
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
customer service good business to uh Aid
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
bills Mr chairman can I follow this up
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
just sir you can do a followup question
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you sir I appreciate it and
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative stapon uh so
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
how could I mean just thinking putting
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
on my devil's advocate cap here um how
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
could I at Bob's G garage uh just not
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
send out a paper statement then just
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
have sort of like all these companies
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
have shipping and handling charges uh
 
01:27:05.229 --> 01:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
shipping is the cost of actually sending
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
the product and the handling is some
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
mysterious charge the cardboard box the
 
01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
envelope the stamp all that other sort
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
of stuff so how do I not just put
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
shipping and handling uh or something
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
along those Natures in my bill uh and
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
send it to you and it's basically
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
getting around this legislation it's not
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
a fee for doing paper billing it's my
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
shipping and handling
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
fee yeah um we I don't don't
 
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstand this is Devil's Advocate
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not advocating skirting the
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
law you as the question okay that's good
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's that's a great
 
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
question and I think it's already
 
01:27:43.830 --> 01:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
happening um you know you buy an item
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
and it's discounted and it's the best on
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
Amazon or the internet for uh $9.95
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
everybody else is $15 and then you get
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
to the checkout and then the uh the
 
01:27:56.550 --> 01:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
shipping and handling is1
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
15.95 and then you got to cancel that
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
and go back and find out who's got the
 
01:28:04.109 --> 01:28:04.119 align:start position:0%
free shipping uh so that you can get the
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
real price the real Allin price um and
 
01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
you know when when I'm faced with that
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at that vendor and I'm
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
saying okay they're going to play this
 
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh this shell game trick here's one
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
price but when you get to the check out
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
here's another which one which shell is
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
the pee underneath of and then I'm going
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
to decline to go to that vendor uh ever
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
again because I know the tricks that
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to play um and I've been
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
in business myself and fair billing
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
clear billing paper billing is what I
 
01:28:43.149 --> 01:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
always used and uh be prepared to defend
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
your bill and be fair with all of the
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
peripheral charges and the assessments
 
01:28:50.590 --> 01:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
that you make on that bill that bill is
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
a testimony of how well you do business
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
and how well you attitude of customer
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
service is and it goes hand inand with
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the uh estimate which is also generally
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
a paper thing but can be
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
electronic um sometimes I think in the
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
society we don't give enough attention
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
to the clerical aspects of running a
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
business and making it clear and helpful
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
for people to be able to read understand
 
01:29:21.470 --> 01:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
invoices great uh repr restive aberson
 
01:29:27.550 --> 01:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
has is next in line for a
 
01:29:31.109 --> 01:29:31.119 align:start position:0%
question okay so this this rule applies
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't a consumer protection for New
 
01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers this is a
 
01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
restriction on businesses or a fine for
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
businesses that make the mistake of
 
01:29:41.350 --> 01:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
moving to New Hampshire um because
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that that would be hit
 
01:29:45.109 --> 01:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
by this but I'm I'm still looking at
 
01:29:47.709 --> 01:29:47.719 align:start position:0%
this and I'm thinking okay if you have a
 
01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
business that is trying to offer some
 
01:29:53.550 --> 01:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
kind of discount for people who do the
 
01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.430 align:start position:0%
kind of discount for people who do the
electronic

01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
payment they want to pass that on that
 
01:29:59.109 --> 01:29:59.119 align:start position:0%
looks like it's still a price
 
01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
differential how do you guarantee that
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
you can avoid the fine or somebody going
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
to be caught unawares not realizing that
 
01:30:07.310 --> 01:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
that uh they're going to be hit with
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
this this fine for uh offering a
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
discount yeah I I don't see in the bill
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
any uh against that mention of it and
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
and I think once again it goes to fair
 
01:30:26.229 --> 01:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.910 --> 01:30:28.920 align:start position:0%
already rep Stapleton C could you uh
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
make sure you're not rubbing your phone
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
against your facial hair or your shirt
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
or something like
 
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
that I get the paper in front of me
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
sorry about that yeah okay um we we
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
already do that when we give discounts
 
01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh for senior citizens um Andor volume
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
discounts uh why can't we give one for
 
01:30:56.669 --> 01:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
um electronic use to save that customer
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's the incentive for the customer to
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
compromise away from the paper billing I
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
think that's in line with what we're
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
already doing and I don't think the bill
 
01:31:11.070 --> 01:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
prohibits that or affects it followup um
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
okay yes sir further question right all
 
01:31:16.109 --> 01:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
right further question it is the bill
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
just says no person shall charge a
 
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
consumer an additional rate or fee for
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
electing to make a payment by United
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
States mail or receiving paper billing
 
01:31:27.709 --> 01:31:27.719 align:start position:0%
statement that that means any
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
differential between electronic and
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
paying by paper so they they're not if
 
01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
there's a discount offered to pay
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
electronically then there effectively is
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
a different rate charge and this is what
 
01:31:43.510 --> 01:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
this is saying an additional rate or fee
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
additional rate or fee so it's it's two
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
different rates so how do you guarantee
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
that uh you don't get caught by this um
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
well I I would say that um the
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
difference is if you're going to charge
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
a fee for a paper billing that's an
 
01:32:05.199 --> 01:32:06.669 align:start position:0%
a fee for a paper billing that's an
upfront

01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
upfront
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
charge um and if you're not going to
 
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
charge the fee but you may give a
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
discount for an electronic billing that
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a backend charger discount
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
what the bill is trying to do is prevent
 
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
a wholesale sweep into a movement where
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to eliminate the paper
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
billing and affect those
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
people again yeah
 
01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay I thought it was static on the
 
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
phone line but I don't know what you're
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
doing with your hands or um I'm
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
basically still but
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
um phone
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
interference some kind of interference
 
01:32:46.679 --> 01:32:48.430 align:start position:0%
interference some kind of interference
yeah

01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
some okay um all right so I think we'll
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
move on um max so uh representative
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
Terry thank you Mr chairman
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton um I'm in
 
01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.109 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton um I'm in
sympathy

01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
sympathy
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
with uh the thrust of the
 
01:33:11.030 --> 01:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
bill and the central feature of as I
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
understand it of not uh levying
 
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
additional charges on people who who opt
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
to uh to receive a paper Bill and go
 
01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
that route however I am deeply troubled
 
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
exemptions um and I I need to really
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
hear what the rationale is for each of
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
the exempts in this legisl proposed
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um first we're in a we're
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
living in a time where there's there's
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
deep cynicism developing uh towards uh
 
01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:47.189 align:start position:0%
deep cynicism developing uh towards uh
double

01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
double
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
standards and um when we read that the
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
government um and utilities for example
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
example are granted exemptions people
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
are going to react many people are going
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
to react in in the way uh that this once
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
again these are rules for for me but not
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
for thee and so I'm I I really need
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
before I can can move forward and and
 
01:34:19.109 --> 01:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
feel positively about this bill uh I I
 
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
need to know what the rationale is for
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
all of these exemptions it's deeply
 
01:34:22.719 --> 01:34:27.149 align:start position:0%
all of these exemptions it's deeply
troubling

01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
um uh I would have
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
preferred the bill without exemptions
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
but I'm not the sponsor I'm the I'm a
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and that question should
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
really be answered by the sponsor who's
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
worked uh long and hard on bringing this
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
bill to you um because I I do feel that
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
there should be uh some further
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
protection even for those that are
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
listed as
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
Exempted but I'm supporting this bill
 
01:35:02.189 --> 01:35:02.199 align:start position:0%
because I like the direction that it's
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
moving in away from what the culture is
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
tending to do um by uh discouraging
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
paper um billing and paper payment uh
 
01:35:18.070 --> 01:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
and I think we have to put the breaks on
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
that so in my view I'm supporting this
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
bill because it's a start in the general
 
01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
in the right direction uh to protect the
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
consumer at the lower end um who can't
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
use or doesn't want to use uh electronic
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
means for
 
01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
payment great thank you very much for
 
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:38.510 align:start position:0%
payment great thank you very much for
your

01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
testimony uh the chair will now call on
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
Diane shuid who I am now moving you up
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:52.639 --> 01:35:58.109 align:start position:0%
 
Diane

01:35:58.109 --> 01:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is Diane Shu uh I
 
01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
represent marac 20 the towns of
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
Chichester and Pembrook I'm also a co-pa
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
on this bill and uh I did submit written
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
testimony but uh a lot of it repeats
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
what's already been stated um my main
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
thrust with this is protection for
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
seniors who tend to not own computers
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
not do business online and depend on
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
paper billing to keep track of things uh
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
I will tell you that uh number one I'm a
 
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
senior citizen myself but I also help um
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
several senior couples in my community
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh drive them to do shopping uh so forth
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
and for them a lot of their issues are
 
01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:01.880 align:start position:0%
keeping track of things we all know that
 
01:37:05.550 --> 01:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
it's less expensive for all of us the
 
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
state and our communities to keep
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
seniors living in their homes as long as
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
possible and one of the major reasons
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
that they have to abandon living at home
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
and move into nursing homes or whatever
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
is their inability to take care of their
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
own financial matters uh I would say in
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
answer to one of the questions I heard
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
previously um about paying utilities and
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
so forth being Exempted I think probably
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
these seniors tend to keep track of
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
those better because it's something that
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
occurs monthly whereas getting the car
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
fixed and paying Bob's Garage is a
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
random case and to be honest I have one
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
couple particularly who constantly have
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
the the discussion did we pay so and so
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
well if they've gotten a paper Bill and
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
they've kept their portion of that paper
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
bill which is usually the case they can
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
look back and see yes oh yeah there it
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
is I sent the portion with the payment
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
right it's a way for them to
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
maintain their financial Independence
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
and stay in their homes uh I would also
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
point out uh one of the questions put
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
forward was uh paying fees for internet
 
01:38:34.510 --> 01:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
billing and I would submit that most of
 
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
the people that this bill applies to uh
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
would not be charging things over the
 
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
internet if they don't have a computer
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
to pay their bill they're probably not
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
buying goods or services over the
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
internet as well so it's another case
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to be applying
 
01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to be applying
this

01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:58.109 --> 01:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
fee and I would also say that if you do
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
opt to pay your bills by internet the
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
fees that are charged are inherent when
 
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
you start that process most companies
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
that charge fees for Internet service
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
that's implied right right from the
 
01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
get-go when you take that option uh and
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
I think we all have to be aware that
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
fees such as the chairman mentioned uh
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
for baggage and so forth are subject to
 
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
change um so that's about all that I
 
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
have to add if there are further
 
01:39:36.790 --> 01:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be glad to
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
answer uh representative van hton has a
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you I think I have more
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
of a would you believe kind of question
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
but I would just like to throw this out
 
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
um the vaccination the covid vaccination
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
roll out featured many elderly people
 
01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
who only had access to to making their
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
registration by means of phone and would
 
01:39:59.790 --> 01:39:59.800 align:start position:0%
you say that they were although this
 
01:40:02.189 --> 01:40:02.199 align:start position:0%
isn't quite the same as paper building I
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
see it as a parallel would you say that
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's a case in point to support the
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
need for taking care of these elderly
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
senior citizens uh definitely one of
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
them uh I will say um for those of you
 
01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
who aren't aware um a seniors were uh
 
01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
given the option seniors and folks that
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
can't afford computers to call two 11 uh
 
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
over the telephone which almost every
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
senior at least have access to
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
telephones uh I will point out I tried
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
to help one of my my seniors that I
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
assist and it took us uh a half an hour
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
of calling 211 to get through it was
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
constantly busy but that was an option
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
rather than uh making your appointment
 
01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.229 align:start position:0%
rather than uh making your appointment
online

01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
yourself so yeah that
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
definitely um the the part of our
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
population that this bill is aiming to
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
help uh I will say also the the thought
 
01:41:07.229 --> 01:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
occurred to me when um I think it was
 
01:41:10.350 --> 01:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
representative Terry was talking about
 
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
um exempting utilities and so forth the
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
only entity that this bill specifically
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
exempts is government entities those
 
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
other um billing entities utilities and
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
so forth as the chairman mentioned
 
01:41:30.109 --> 01:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
that's already in the law we aren't
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
putting that in this that was already
 
01:41:34.589 --> 01:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
there so you're gonna have to ask the
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor of that section of the RSA what
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
they were thinking when they had made
 
01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:42.950 align:start position:0%
they were thinking when they had made
those

01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
exemptions fair enough uh
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
and uh so representative Abramson has a
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
question we're we're running up a time
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
here Max
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
okay it's quickest question ever so the
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
bill and and these laws in general don't
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
apply to New Hampshire oops my hair's
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
out of place don't apply to New
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers they apply to those
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
businesses that move to New Hampshire so
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
if you have a new startup or or this
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
this isn't a startup at all uh if Unitil
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to move their operations from
 
01:42:20.109 --> 01:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
Boston to New Hampshire they could no
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
longer that's not a good example they're
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're a public utility so there would
 
01:42:26.669 --> 01:42:26.679 align:start position:0%
be well if a company wanted to move from
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
B sorry Mr chair if if company wanted to
 
01:42:31.629 --> 01:42:31.639 align:start position:0%
move from Boston to New Hampshire they
 
01:42:33.709 --> 01:42:33.719 align:start position:0%
would be facing this penalty and the
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
legal question of whether or not they
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
could charge a different rate for paper
 
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
versus uh online billing is that
 
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
correct theoretically they should
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully they know our laws before they
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
make the decision to move to the state
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
of Hamshire well I don't know the law
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that you know at this
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
point it's not a law at this moment so
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
let's you know I don't know what the
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
bill would mean even looking at it
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would be penalized
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
for offering the discount I hear you I
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
hear your question I understand where
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
you're coming from um thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the point I would have
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
made also that they know what they're
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
facing when they decide to come here
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough thank you very much
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh Suzanne Vale and I have already
 
01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
upgraded you Suzanne so you can go ahead
 
01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.109 align:start position:0%
upgraded you Suzanne so you can go ahead
and

01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
testify Mr chair um thank you Mr
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and honorable colleagues um and
 
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony in
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
support of
 
01:43:33.550 --> 01:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
HB 76 I am representative Suzanne Vale
 
01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:37.239 align:start position:0%
of Nash ward 3 and I'm representing both
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
my district and myself which is
 
01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 30 and I'm also a co-sponsor
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
bill I have personally experienced
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
difficulty with navigating onlight
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
statement and payment the whole
 
01:43:53.589 --> 01:43:53.599 align:start position:0%
Revolution really here is a small
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
example out of many that I've had um I
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
had a problem with my cell phone service
 
01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
this year I bought a hot spot equipment
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
in order for my daughter to travel on
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
serious family business but she wasn't
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
getting the amount of data that we paid
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
for and
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
um I logged into our account and I could
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
see that in fact the device was now on a
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
different plan I searched for the
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
transactions that would have caused this
 
01:44:25.109 --> 01:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
I opened a chat and was told that the
 
01:44:27.990 --> 01:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
online view I was looking at is not kept
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
current for transactions like the one I
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
would be looking for and that they would
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be reflected in the bill
 
01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
that I would be able to see online
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
whether that was true or not the answer
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
was not online I would never have been
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
able to resolve this if I weren't
 
01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
grudgingly willing to pay their $2 fee
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
bills I was able able to track the
 
01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
transaction once I got the information
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
and I found the date and the time of
 
01:45:02.910 --> 01:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
mistake so then I was able to call and
 
01:45:06.750 --> 01:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
ask them to fix what I had found I can't
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
personally attest that my information
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
was not on their website but I couldn't
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
find it and the only way I could fix
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
this is with to get the paperwork and
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
turn the computer off and sit down and
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
reconcile it these fees seem to be
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
levied by companies that really have you
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
over a barrel we had a serious family
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
emergency going on and we needed that
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
hotspot to be delivering the service
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we paid for I will be staying with
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
the paper bills just as a matter of
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
trust on the basis of that incident
 
01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
although I've had many but I really
 
01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:42.679 align:start position:0%
believe that getting in on the paper
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
with that company will give me great
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
efficacy in the problem solving in other
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
words I can keep my computer shut and I
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about it now no one
 
01:45:57.589 --> 01:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
has a $2 a month fee to spare in order
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
to trust their vendor but I am very
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
fortunate now as as a state
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
representative and just as a person in
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
my life I have a lot of support there
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
are a lot of people that have broad man
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
that could help me where I unable to
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
access it um I have other courses to
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
take in terms of getting help from other
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
people but calls emails and chats that
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
solve nothing are far more serious is a
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
problem to people who don't have
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
internet or the resources every day it
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
gets harder for the elderly and
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged people to make it living
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
alone we can't allow companies to take
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
away the $2 from our residents in order
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
to encourage more streamlined online
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
bill paying and autod dting society that
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
we now live in it's wonderful to see all
 
01:46:49.229 --> 01:46:49.239 align:start position:0%
these amazing technological advances I'm
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
kind of a geek and I love it myself but
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
as my 81 yearold stepdad astutely says
 
01:46:59.310 --> 01:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge has a halflife of five years
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
nowadays and I think it's true what
 
01:47:03.990 --> 01:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
started as a way to encourage folks to
 
01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
pay online is now a way to keep
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
consumers from their own information and
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
the way that they can access it time has
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
passed since people would pick up the
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
phone when you have a problem and answer
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
it without asking you to wait online for
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
a year the original plan that has been
 
01:47:24.189 --> 01:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
executed I feel is no longer ethical 10
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
years ago when they wanted to encourage
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
people to pay bills online and receive
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
these things and you know they it's all
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
very good but um that 10 years has gone
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
by large companies do this I support the
 
01:47:38.589 --> 01:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
fines on the basis of their ability to
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
afford to pay them I know that telom
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
companies can afford this and they can
 
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
process to they can afford to process
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
any kind of payment I I I believe that I
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
have looked around me wherever I go
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
which isn't far these days and I see
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
elderly people ask for their phone
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
number their rewards number everything
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
under the sun in order to make a cash
 
01:48:04.589 --> 01:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
transaction in a Walgreens we can't be
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
so indifferent when we're trying to
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
insist people who do not have access or
 
01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to comprehend the constant
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
change in the way that money transacts
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
today in the changing world it is my
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
hope that the committee will support the
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
bill and if they find necessary to make
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
the necessary amendments that address
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
the questions that arose today um if
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with the smaller
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
companies being affected you could
 
01:48:36.589 --> 01:48:36.599 align:start position:0%
exempt companies with a small amount of
 
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
employees in any fashion that you you
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
know is legal I am not an expert I thank
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
you so much for hearing my anecdotal te
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
testimony and with that I will take
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
questions um the committee members may
 
01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:57.880 align:start position:0%
have okay I don't see any hands up um so
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
I think you're oh uh representative mle
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
has a
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
question what if a company opted out of
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
M uh mail billing alog together and they
 
01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
said they would only bill um online how
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
would they how would this Bill affect
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
them I don't think I can answer that
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
question but as I was looking looking um
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
into the bill originally when it was
 
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
filed the first time um I found that I
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
think it's against federal law so I
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to say for sure but I think
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
there's some federal um legislation that
 
01:49:40.709 --> 01:49:40.719 align:start position:0%
prevents people from not giving a
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
statement of any kind on
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
paper yeah I don't know anything about
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
that but I I would say that in your
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
example um of using a cell phone company
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
cell phone companies are not regulated
 
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
by the Pu so they would not be exempt
 
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
from the statute and the assumption
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
would be is uh the reason that is true
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
is that there is a free market that you
 
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
can choose and shop around when it comes
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
to cell phone companies and so therefore
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
there was no need for the public
 
01:50:11.109 --> 01:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
utilities to be involved in regulating
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
that industry so uh seeing no more
 
01:50:17.709 --> 01:50:17.719 align:start position:0%
question oh uh representative aberson
 
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
we're we're out of time Max so make it
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
quick okay as quick as I can so you say
 
01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
had two companies this doesn't apply to
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consumers it applies to
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses that do
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire correct so if
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
we have a if you have a New Hampshire
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
billing company and they're competing
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
with somebody in Massachusetts is this
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
now putting the New Hampshire company at
 
01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
a competitive
 
01:50:43.589 --> 01:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
disadvantage not in my
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
opinion not in my opinion um I come from
 
01:50:49.470 --> 01:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
a land where if you pay cash you get a
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
discount that's the way it is at my
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
printer and and you all know how much
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
the house depends on printed material so
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
what I can say about interstate commerce
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
is that I know when the laws get
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
stricter in California they seem to get
 
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
stricter everywhere and that's suppos to
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
be a joke
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
so well we don't want to throw other
 
01:51:13.030 --> 01:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
states under the
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
bus all right well thank you very much
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh and I uh we see let's see I got a
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
bunch of people who did not testify but
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%

01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill um I have
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%

01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
in support of the bill and we have

representative Dolan and supported the
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh and then we have Alvin C who's a
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
member of the public who's opposed to
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
the bill and we have Ryan hail of the
 
01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Bankers Association uh who
 
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:38.360 align:start position:0%

we'll close the public hearing on House
Bill

01:52:42.270 --> 01:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:52:46.109 --> 01:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
76 and as I said before this bill 76 is
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
an early Bill along with the first one
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
we heard 610 so we will try I will try
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
schedule exec sessions fairly quickly I
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
think it's going to be let's say the
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
third day that we meet is when I have a
 
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
schedule in for their exec
 
01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
sessions uh given the time is 10:56 so
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
we'll now move on to our last bill for
 
01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:08.790 align:start position:0%
we'll now move on to our last bill for
this

01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
morning and uh that is uh House Bill
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%

01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill as soon as I finally un mute button
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
here you go very good thank you my name
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
is Jordan erery Hillsboro 37 this bill
 
01:53:54.589 --> 01:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
was introduced because of several
 
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints that have been
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
received regarding um individuals uh
 
01:54:03.069 --> 01:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
businesses entities copying their
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license and then the uh
 
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
constituent began receiving all sorts of
 
01:54:12.669 --> 01:54:12.679 align:start position:0%
unsolicited advertising materials uh
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
affiliated with that particular entity
 
01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
it actually happened uh with me when I
 
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:21.560 align:start position:0%
got a new transmission put in my truck
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh over at
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
um Buick in uh Nashville they
 
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
photocopied the driver's license and I
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
said well RSA 2614 says you can't do
 
01:54:33.390 --> 01:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
that and they said whether do you want
 
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:35.320 align:start position:0%
your transmission or
 
01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:36.910 align:start position:0%
your transmission or
not

01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:54:40.270 --> 01:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
um that's a problem you'll notice I sent
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
out to you a proposed amendment to this
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
to address some of the concerns of the
 
01:54:45.599 --> 01:54:46.950 align:start position:0%
to address some of the concerns of the
pharmaceutical

01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
entities um by Mr Stout I would like for
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
you to consider that if at all possible
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
and as language it uh it makes sense the
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
key uh section of this is down in on
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
line nine paragraph C which says that if
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to uh look at your license
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
then they have to provide you with a
 
01:55:11.550 --> 01:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
coper copy of the uh driver privacy
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
protection policy of the business now
 
01:55:16.350 --> 01:55:16.360 align:start position:0%
that business is required under federal
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
law under the it's the dppa the you know
 
01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
how you love acronyms the driver Federal
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
driver privacy protection act which
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
means that any entity using a driver's
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
license has to have a policy in effect
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
protecting the privacy of the driver
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
license information that has a your
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
driver's license has a lot of
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
information on it your name your address
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
under the uh uh fair credit protection
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
act and the uh fair debt collection
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
protection act that information is
 
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
considered private personal information
 
01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
and is protected by federal law
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
you not you're supposed to keep
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
it secure from any outside entity and
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
just like when you sign up online for
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
something they have to disclose that
 
01:56:07.709 --> 01:56:07.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to be using it for that
 
01:56:10.069 --> 01:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
purpose currently in New Hampshire that
 
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen uh in the particular
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
instance involves the largest
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical Pharmacy uh business in
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
the United States CVS uh went over and
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
apparently Nashville maintains a large
 
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
supply of drugs uh OPI opioid drugs that
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
they don't have when they're smaller
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
areas so you they're forcing people to
 
01:56:36.589 --> 01:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
go to one location which is a good idea
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
they demand the identity of the person
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
picking up the LI uh the uh drugs that's
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine there's no problem with
 
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
that but then they take the um driver's
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
license and copy it or and like one
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
person said they they scanned it in
 
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
which again is a violation of New
 
01:56:57.149 --> 01:56:57.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state
 
01:56:59.550 --> 01:56:59.560 align:start position:0%
law so
 
01:57:02.669 --> 01:57:02.679 align:start position:0%
apparently when confronted on this they
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
they said that the Nashville police
 
01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
instructed them that they had to do it
 
01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
well if the Nashville police are saying
 
01:57:11.470 --> 01:57:11.480 align:start position:0%
that they have to violate
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
2614 then the Nashville police need to
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
have a lesson in Consumer Protection Law
 
01:57:18.910 --> 01:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
and the driver privacy protection act
 
01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
which probably is a good idea anyway but
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh for all the police departments not
 
01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:24.390 align:start position:0%
uh for all the police departments not
just

01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:57:27.589 --> 01:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
Nashville the situation is that there
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
needs some more clarification some more
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
strengthening of this you will also see
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
in your inboxes a letter from um former
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
representative Neil Kirk who was he and
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
I didn't see eye to eye on a lot of
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
things as uh your chair knows but uh
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
he's also in favor of this bill uh with
 
01:57:51.189 --> 01:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
the perhaps the uh addition of the
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
amendment suggest by the uh uh
 
01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacies uh with that I will take any
 
01:58:00.990 --> 01:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
questions and uh be glad to answer
 
01:58:04.069 --> 01:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
them okay uh I don't see any hands up
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
yet but uh representa make sure I
 
01:58:09.669 --> 01:58:09.679 align:start position:0%
understand what you said was that the
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
anybody could use the license but they
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
have to have a written policy or they
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
have to have a a policy of ensuring the
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
privacy of that driver's license
 
01:58:21.629 --> 01:58:21.639 align:start position:0%
information that's correct that's what
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say right well cuz that
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's a kind of a few for me because um
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh as some people might know I rent I
 
01:58:32.069 --> 01:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
rent my castle here and uh when I rent
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
it not standing that some people can
 
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.360 align:start position:0%
book directly through uh vbo but when
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
people direct book with me directly I
 
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
actually asked for their credit for
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
their driver's license and um and some
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
of them send me very nice I got a 3x5
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
nice picture card of some of's driver's
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
license and the purpose of of I doing it
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
is that a is that I'm I'm people come in
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
you know live in my house uh so I like
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
to H match up make sure that when they
 
01:58:59.950 --> 01:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
send me their contract and and and the
 
01:59:02.069 --> 01:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
check that they pay me with which can
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes be sketchy is I want like to
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
have the driver's license match up with
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
that but more importantly is that we
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
have an age requirement you know they
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
have to be 30 so I like to make sure
 
01:59:12.510 --> 01:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
that they just because they said they're
 
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
30 that I actually have documentation of
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
it so as long as I have we have a policy
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
about how we protect the privacy of that
 
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license um so um I'm not
 
01:59:24.709 --> 01:59:24.719 align:start position:0%
breaking the law hopefully yeah so long
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
as you have a policy that's what it says
 
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:29.639 align:start position:0%
in paragraph C line
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh okay well I don't need it I don't
 
01:59:35.069 --> 01:59:35.079 align:start position:0%
need it just need to be sure okay uh
 
01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:38.239 align:start position:0%
representative abson has his hand
 
01:59:40.589 --> 01:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
up sorry actually that was kind of my
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
question you're just saying that you
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
just want them to have a policy so if
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
they take your driver's license and
 
01:59:50.669 --> 01:59:50.679 align:start position:0%
photocopy it and uh keep a copy of it
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
for some amount of time wouldn't it make
 
01:59:53.709 --> 01:59:53.719 align:start position:0%
make more sense to limit the amount of
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
time that they could keep it say 90 days
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
or 30 days or something and then destroy
 
02:00:01.109 --> 02:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
the paper so that uh you don't have that
 
02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679 align:start position:0%
material uh lying around I um am not
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
objecting to that at all I am objecting
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
to them scanning the driver's license
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
because there's some information on the
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
M magnetic strip that is law enforcement
 
02:00:18.629 --> 02:00:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.639 --> 02:00:20.189 align:start position:0%
 
cough

02:00:20.189 --> 02:00:20.199 align:start position:0%
cough
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
um some of the information on the
 
02:00:25.709 --> 02:00:25.719 align:start position:0%
magnetic strip is uh is
 
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
proprietary and there's when if it's
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
scanned in then they have to go back in
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
and scan it but I have no uh objection
 
02:00:34.750 --> 02:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
to adding to that the key thing is that
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
businesses and law enforcement need to
 
02:00:40.030 --> 02:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
understand that there is a uh existing
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
law RSA 2614 and this in consumer
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
protection would then also enhance that
 
02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:52.360 align:start position:0%
by saying you have to protect this
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
information if you want to be in
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
business and if you want to demand that
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
information it's it's as simple as that
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh to answer your Chairman's uh
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
comment about uh having a policy it just
 
02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
you can just say my policy is that I
 
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
follow the Federal dppa which means you
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't share it with anyone unless you're
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
giving unless there's a positive uh
 
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
consent to share that
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
information um but yeah I can see
 
02:01:26.350 --> 02:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining a a time limit thank you Max
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay follow-up question sure uh all
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
right so this only applies to
 
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
reproduction or copying this wouldn't
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
apply to you know just somebody looking
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
at the driver's license it's only if
 
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's if they're making a copy you want
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
them to have a policy correct if they
 
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
make a copy or maintain the information
 
02:01:47.470 --> 02:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
going up to h a pharmacy and and saying
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
I'm picking up some hydrocodone because
 
02:01:54.310 --> 02:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh I broke my uh ribs and I did earlier
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
last year late in the fall um and
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
showing your license to show that you
 
02:02:01.470 --> 02:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
are who the person on the prescription
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
is that that's common sense but making a
 
02:02:06.709 --> 02:02:06.719 align:start position:0%
copy of it and then perhaps giving that
 
02:02:08.830 --> 02:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
copy to the police department later of
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
all the people that uh got
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
hydrocodone and that's that's that's a
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
far okay thank you representative
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
burough yes um thank you for taking my
 
02:02:23.669 --> 02:02:23.679 align:start position:0%
question representative just a quick
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
question um do you know how extensive a
 
02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
problem there is other than the
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
anecdotal um you know evidence that you
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
had um with the
 
02:02:33.119 --> 02:02:34.629 align:start position:0%
had um with the
transmission

02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
well I've had several people contact me
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
on that most of them have been dealing
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
with the drug companies in nashv or the
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
pharmacies in Nashville uh we don't
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
really have any drug companies but the
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
phes in Nashville and of course I'm in
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
in this area I've also and some of my
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
fraternal activities had uh coffee
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
discussions with individuals where this
 
02:02:59.310 --> 02:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
has become common practice for them to
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
um make a copy of your driver's license
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
for if you're paying by check and
 
02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
yet one of Mr Kirks or former
 
02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:09.910 align:start position:0%
yet one of Mr Kirks or former
representative

02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
Kirk's primary things was to prevent the
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
placing of the driver's license number
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
on a commercial paper that is spread out
 
02:03:21.239 --> 02:03:22.669 align:start position:0%
on a commercial paper that is spread out
everywhere

02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
so they're they're circumventing the
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
intent of existing law so I think this
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
just tightens it up a little bit and
 
02:03:33.790 --> 02:03:33.800 align:start position:0%
clarifies it but at the same time
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't place an excessive burden on the
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
businesses and I'm open to suggestions
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
wording okay um see no other hands
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
up uh oh yeah okay see I got this
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%

02:04:10.679 --> 02:04:15.589 align:start position:0%
 
too

02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:18.109 --> 02:04:18.119 align:start position:0%

02:04:26.990 --> 02:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
the microphone
 
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
is is this better yes there you go so my
 
02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
this oh you did you're dying out again
 
02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
you were there and then all of a sudden
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%

you how does this affect going into and
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
registering to vote and showing ID
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
because you need that you need your ID
 
02:04:59.870 --> 02:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
they need that paperwork and they need
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
to see so how does that affect that it
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect at all because you're
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
merely showing your driver's license
 
02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%

thought I had House Bill
 
02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
109 representative aler bill so how do I
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
oh okay that was good planning oh some
 
02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
reason I thought it was after lunch okay
 
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
uh so that's at uh
 
02:07:20.109 --> 02:07:20.119 align:start position:0%
10:45 so we're we're past that moment so
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
11:15 oh where am I five
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
minutes almost perfect okay so everybody
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
can take a break for five minutes sorry
 
02:07:34.510 --> 02:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
about that I this somehow I thought that
 
02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:35.350 align:start position:0%
about that I this somehow I thought that
was

02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
115 not looking at my paper correctly
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
John can I ask you a question yes go
 
02:07:46.830 --> 02:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.750 --> 02:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
neutral oh they
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
are well
 
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I I I I'm my guess
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
they uh it's an
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
agency um not withstanding the insurance
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
department which is exemp but they I
 
02:08:07.709 --> 02:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
don't know they they
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't know why she felt compelled
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
to do that we'll have next time I see
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
Marty I'll ask her yeah that's I it's
 
02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
the same question I ask in ways and
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
means when one of the agencies come in
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh your job is type thing yeah well we
 
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:25.320 align:start position:0%
certainly for instance we have the
 
02:08:27.069 --> 02:08:27.079 align:start position:0%
agency bills and they're certainly in
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
support of their own bills they can't be
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
neutral on their own
 
02:08:34.270 --> 02:08:34.280 align:start position:0%
bills it's just a pet peeve I I would
 
02:08:36.669 --> 02:08:36.679 align:start position:0%
prefer them to come in and say this
 
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
would have the effect of and why they're
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
either yeah I I like I say I'll have to
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
ask her why she why she did that but
 
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know I think she might
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
have put herself on the list just so in
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
case somebody had a question about
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
insurance or something maybe but so
 
02:08:59.709 --> 02:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem okay so Erin I do see
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
you and Mr Speaker how are you uh um I
 
02:09:06.629 --> 02:09:06.639 align:start position:0%
the question I have is I can't see if if
 
02:09:08.109 --> 02:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
the two members in the committee rooms
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
don't have computers I don't know I
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
can't really see
 
02:09:14.109 --> 02:09:14.119 align:start position:0%
them um if they want a question because
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's so puny even though I've got it on
 
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
full screen here I I can barely barely
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
see so if you speak you'll you could
 
02:09:22.510 --> 02:09:22.520 align:start position:0%
jump up to the front of my screen I
 
02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:25.549 align:start position:0%
jump up to the front of my screen I
assume

02:09:25.549 --> 02:09:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
right I can't even hear anything are you
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
it it's not muted in the committee room
 
02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I see it's not muted but the
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
microphone are you I see Aaron
 
02:09:40.350 --> 02:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
disappearing so maybe Aaron's working on

the microphone he's near the Monitor and
 
02:09:46.189 --> 02:09:46.199 align:start position:0%

Bill uh 11 109 and here from the primary
 
02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative yri good morning
 
02:12:43.470 --> 02:12:43.480 align:start position:0%
representative yri uh good morning Mr
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and I haven't seen you in at
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
least 30 minutes
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
um um for the record my name is Jordan
 
02:12:53.470 --> 02:12:53.480 align:start position:0%
oler representing Hillsboro 37 Hudson
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
and pelum down the southern part of the
 
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
State uh the this Bill had been
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
introduced last year and it didn't go
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
very far um but I think it's important
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
that we take uh into consideration what
 
02:13:11.549 --> 02:13:11.559 align:start position:0%
is too often happening uh with consumers
 
02:13:13.709 --> 02:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
and this goes back I think a little bit
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
to the bill herd that I came in on uh
 
02:13:19.950 --> 02:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
hb76 regarding paperless
 
02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
billing what what has happened and what
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
I've got several seniors that have
 
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
called me and complained is that all of
 
02:13:30.549 --> 02:13:30.559 align:start position:0%
a sudden their credit rating goes down
 
02:13:32.189 --> 02:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
or they get a notice from a credit
 
02:13:35.030 --> 02:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
company a credit collection company and
 
02:13:37.149 --> 02:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
they didn't know that they owed a
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
balance on their hospital bill or that
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
they didn't uh owe um or that they owed
 
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh something on a consumer transaction a
 
02:13:51.629 --> 02:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
balance that they had no idea
 
02:13:53.750 --> 02:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh we all know that the M United States
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
Postal Service does an excellent job
 
02:13:59.709 --> 02:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
when they do an excellent job um I just
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
got a Christmas card
 
02:14:06.390 --> 02:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday often times too often the mail
 
02:14:09.549 --> 02:14:09.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't come directly through what does
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
come through is the uh priority post
 
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
although it sometimes takes long for
 
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
that I had some um paperwork that I was
 
02:14:20.350 --> 02:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
uh trying to deliver to an individual
 
02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
took six weeks to get from brain tree to
 
02:14:24.910 --> 02:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
Hudson I could have walked down and back
 
02:14:27.549 --> 02:14:27.559 align:start position:0%
in that time well maybe not
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
but the thing is if you're going to push
 
02:14:34.589 --> 02:14:34.599 align:start position:0%
someone into credit
 
02:14:38.109 --> 02:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
collections spending $270 cents to send
 
02:14:39.549 --> 02:14:39.559 align:start position:0%
a certified
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
notice is
 
02:14:46.589 --> 02:14:46.599 align:start position:0%
not an overly um honorous burden on the
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
company or the entity whether it's a
 
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
small mom and popop shop who doesn't
 
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a lot of collections
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
because their cash or credit card or
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
debit card but for a hospital or uh
 
02:15:04.149 --> 02:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
larger business
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
$22.70 I think the uh the cost analysis
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
for a letter is $5 so make it
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
$8 cost on a bill is not that of an
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
honorous event and it benefits both the
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
enti and the consumer the consumer knows
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
that they owe a balance and it gives
 
02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
them a chance before their credit is
 
02:15:31.950 --> 02:15:31.960 align:start position:0%
affected to resolve the issue and the
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
entity that has a a balance
 
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
due knows whether or not the consumer
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
still lives at that address because they
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
get their card
 
02:15:46.589 --> 02:15:46.599 align:start position:0%
back and if when it comes to court if
 
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
they decide to sue the individual if the
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
amount is large enough for them to sue
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
like from a credit card company or
 
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
something like that they have a positive
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
notification when they go to court
 
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
saying hey we gave this guy every chance
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
and nothing happened so I look at it as
 
02:16:10.030 --> 02:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
as a as a win-win even though it does
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
require uh somebody to do something uh
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
on the collection side uh with that Mr
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
chair I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:16:20.149 --> 02:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee or people
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
in the audience may
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
have okay so um before I take a question
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
I make sure I understand so you're not
 
02:16:31.469 --> 02:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
looking for that the person has to
 
02:16:31.479 --> 02:16:33.030 align:start position:0%
looking for that the person has to
actually

02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
get the um the the certified letter
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
there there you that let's say the
 
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
certified letter comes back and they say
 
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
it was undeliverable the the person
 
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
refused it or didn't collect it or you
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
know the post office and post office if
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
you get this notice that they didn't get
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
it that that's not your problem you're
 
02:16:52.830 --> 02:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying they'd still be in
 
02:16:56.589 --> 02:16:56.599 align:start position:0%
compliance as long as they attempted to
 
02:16:59.469 --> 02:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
send a certified letter yes I thought
 
02:17:02.190 --> 02:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
that was clear but if not that's fine
 
02:17:05.349 --> 02:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't necessarily have to be um
 
02:17:08.669 --> 02:17:08.679 align:start position:0%
a certified letter there are entities uh
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
out and about I think there's one over
 
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
in the the uh western part of the state
 
02:17:15.870 --> 02:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
that actually goes out and will put a uh
 
02:17:17.709 --> 02:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
what they call a a
 
02:17:21.549 --> 02:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
door knocker notice like like we do when
 
02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
we're campaigning uh on your door only
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
it has it's in a sealed envelope so it's
 
02:17:28.910 --> 02:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
not publicly viewable for
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
fdcpa um requirements but that's also
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
possible if you have a a um a large
 
02:17:40.270 --> 02:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
enough uh debt on uh say a mortgage or
 
02:17:42.429 --> 02:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
something like that where they they want
 
02:17:46.190 --> 02:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
to know um but yeah the attempt needs to
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
be made not necessarily the successful
 
02:17:51.509 --> 02:17:51.519 align:start position:0%
completion of it yeah I guess the
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
problem I got was the word affirmative
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
because affirmative means that you
 
02:17:59.389 --> 02:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
affirm that the person got it but I I I
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
read it I see that it does not say that
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
any actual physical affirmation has to
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
occur okay Mr chair yeah you could
 
02:18:10.389 --> 02:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
probably strike out on line three the
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
word give and put down shall attempt
 
02:18:15.629 --> 02:18:15.639 align:start position:0%
yeah something like that okay all right
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh first up is representative Aon with
 
02:18:18.319 --> 02:18:19.190 align:start position:0%
uh first up is representative Aon with
the

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:21.389 --> 02:18:21.399 align:start position:0%
question go ahead Max
 
02:18:23.870 --> 02:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I was still on mute um
 
02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
basically the same question as the last
 
02:18:28.589 --> 02:18:28.599 align:start position:0%
not the last time the bill before but
 
02:18:32.150 --> 02:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
this these rules apply to not the
 
02:18:33.990 --> 02:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
consumer it's not consumer protection it
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
applies to the business so this this
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
would only apply to businesses that
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
operate in New Hampshire correct or is
 
02:18:42.429 --> 02:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
this different because this is you know
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
before you go to a New Hampshire Court
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
this is this would be before you go to a
 
02:18:49.790 --> 02:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Court and uh that it
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to just New Hampshire
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
businesses it says a creditor it doesn't
 
02:18:56.429 --> 02:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
say from where that creditor is
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
located and if a out of state entity
 
02:19:01.389 --> 02:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't comply with New Hampshire law
 
02:19:05.549 --> 02:19:05.559 align:start position:0%
well they've got no chance at all to uh
 
02:19:07.429 --> 02:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh oh there's a term I forgot the name
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
of it um when um certify our results in
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
their own local
 
02:19:13.439 --> 02:19:15.509 align:start position:0%
their own local
Court

02:19:15.509 --> 02:19:15.519 align:start position:0%
Court
 
02:19:19.709 --> 02:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.719 --> 02:19:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
Bartlett

02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you for taking my
 
02:19:27.429 --> 02:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
question representative earie
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
um so all of the bills that people
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
get by paper don't count so if you're
 
02:19:38.349 --> 02:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
usually you get a bill and it takes 30
 
02:19:40.509 --> 02:19:40.519 align:start position:0%
days you're supposed to pay it then you
 
02:19:42.509 --> 02:19:42.519 align:start position:0%
get another bill and it says your 30
 
02:19:45.469 --> 02:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
days overdue and you don't pay it and
 
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
then usually it takes 60 days to go to a
 
02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
collection so all of the other notices
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't count now we have to have another
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
notice to tell the person who owes the
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
money that that's going to go to a
 
02:20:07.150 --> 02:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
collection Ser agency now is that
 
02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
correct that uh it's up to the business
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
as to what time they want to do that uh
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
60 days uh is not my experience and I
 
02:20:22.270 --> 02:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
and uh being forthright I I some what is
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
classified as collections but it did I
 
02:20:27.870 --> 02:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
don't touch any money at all um for a
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
couple of different uh entities um 90
 
02:20:35.750 --> 02:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
days they start to get worried
 
02:20:39.190 --> 02:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
and 120 days is when normally this takes
 
02:20:42.030 --> 02:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
place now if the letter goes and it's
 
02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
not returned this is just a final
 
02:20:48.349 --> 02:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
attempt for the business to know whether
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
or not the individual intends to to do
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
this and it gives the business uh
 
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
positive feedback if you will that this
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
person isn't going to pay the bill so
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
here I need I need the $50 I need the1 I
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
need the
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
$10,000 uh or what is it 33 cents on the
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
dollar is a is
 
02:21:16.750 --> 02:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
a going rate I need that money so they
 
02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
just ship it over unfortunately some of
 
02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
the larger business businesses
 
02:21:24.429 --> 02:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
particularly in medical billing um they
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
don't care about the individual uh they
 
02:21:30.670 --> 02:21:30.680 align:start position:0%
they just Bam Bam Bam Bam next Bam Bam
 
02:21:33.389 --> 02:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
Dam next you know without even
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
attempting to determine the situation
 
02:21:38.469 --> 02:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
which the individual finds
 
02:21:41.230 --> 02:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
himself further question may inquire
 
02:21:42.990 --> 02:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I'm going to give
 
02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
you an example here I got a bill
 
02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday from cockett
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
hospital um going back to a procedure
 
02:21:52.590 --> 02:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
that was done January 31st of
 
02:21:55.349 --> 02:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
2020 and on the bill this is my first
 
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill for it it has places for 30 days
 
02:22:03.389 --> 02:22:03.399 align:start position:0%
overdue 60 days overdue 90 days
 
02:22:06.670 --> 02:22:06.680 align:start position:0%
so I if I don't pay this bill I'm
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
probably going to keep getting notices
 
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
so you're saying
 
02:22:13.630 --> 02:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
that the the dead beat at this point if
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
you're 120 days out you're a
 
02:22:19.990 --> 02:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
deadbeat um still needs another notice
 
02:22:21.389 --> 02:22:21.399 align:start position:0%
to say that it's going to go to a
 
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
collection agency knowing that the
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
collection agencies if they
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
collect typically the um the business
 
02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
gets about 50% and the collection agency
 
02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
gets about 50% is that correct I don't
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
think it's 50% I think the business gets
 
02:22:39.790 --> 02:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit less than that sometimes 40
 
02:22:42.349 --> 02:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
what well that's IMM material that's IM
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
material yeah yeah yes want another
 
02:22:48.429 --> 02:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
notice to go a final notice an
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
affirmative notice something that is
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
taking a step that that that is positive
 
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
to the individual to assure that you're
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
getting a bill now that's a year old I
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
got a bill from Southern New Hampshire
 
02:23:06.030 --> 02:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:08.910 --> 02:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
week um and it turns out that that Bill
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
had been referred to collection this was
 
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
just last week uh I've had seniors in
 
02:23:20.030 --> 02:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
town uh say that there's what's going on
 
02:23:22.110 --> 02:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
I never new and then they go and check
 
02:23:23.630 --> 02:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
their credit records and their credit
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
score is is down 10 15 20 points
 
02:23:30.630 --> 02:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
because they're deadbeat quote
 
02:23:32.710 --> 02:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
unquote because they're referred to a
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
credit collection company even though
 
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
they had no idea they owed the
 
02:23:40.910 --> 02:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill because time with this one the 55
 
02:23:44.110 --> 02:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
cent letter that goes to you is a lot
 
02:23:45.830 --> 02:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
different than a
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
$2.70 return receipt letter because that
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
one is tracked and it has to be delayed
 
02:23:53.389 --> 02:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
delivered it doesn't get burned up on uh
 
02:23:56.190 --> 02:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
they have Turnpike in a mail truck or if
 
02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
it does you know that it has been burned
 
02:24:02.950 --> 02:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
up so if I get get this maybe what's
 
02:24:05.230 --> 02:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
confusing is the two weeks and the
 
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
affirmative and all that what you really
 
02:24:11.469 --> 02:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
want is that whenever an entity has
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
decided to send your name and debt to
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
collection okay whenever it is could be
 
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
the first month it could be two years
 
02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:20.950 align:start position:0%
the first month it could be two years
later

02:24:20.950 --> 02:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
later
 
02:24:23.150 --> 02:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
or whenever they want to do it whatever
 
02:24:25.710 --> 02:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
they thought that you want them to have
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
leased have put something in the mail or
 
02:24:31.630 --> 02:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
hung something on the door to say by the
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
way we just sent you out to collection
 
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
or are going to send you out the
 
02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
collection no no they going you want the
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
notification so I'm saying you're conf
 
02:24:43.150 --> 02:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
that's what gets people all worried
 
02:24:46.030 --> 02:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
about timing and so you just want
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
whenever somebody has submitted a name
 
02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
they they want to be you know CU you're
 
02:24:53.269 --> 02:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
you're you're assuming that mean the two
 
02:24:54.510 --> 02:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
weeks is going to give them enough time
 
02:24:58.510 --> 02:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
to sell it I I I right now it takes two
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
weeks for a letter to get in the mail to
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
me okay because you know we got we got
 
02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
all kinds of mail problems here so you
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that if
 
02:25:10.389 --> 02:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
somebody's name is ever being sent to a
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
collection agency that that they that
 
02:25:15.309 --> 02:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
there was some letter or notice or
 
02:25:17.469 --> 02:25:17.479 align:start position:0%
something to let them know that they've
 
02:25:20.429 --> 02:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
their name has now been sent over there
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yes in in essence that that I would
 
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
settle for that I prefer pre
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
notification but what you're talking
 
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
about uh Mr chair would be a I think
 
02:25:34.750 --> 02:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial to everyone involved
 
02:25:38.469 --> 02:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
particularly to a consumer who what I
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
owe this Bill here's my 10 bucks why are
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
you sending it to collection you never
 
02:25:44.389 --> 02:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
bother to send me a you know you know
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
the normal arguments that come out but
 
02:25:50.349 --> 02:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
yes I agree with you sir okay
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative aberson has a question
 
02:25:55.150 --> 02:25:55.160 align:start position:0%
another question uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:25:56.429 --> 02:25:56.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question in
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
the middle I'm seeing this this question
 
02:26:00.590 --> 02:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
or the statement No debt collector shall
 
02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
leave a message of debt on a recording
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
device I I assume that that means that
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh that that's not going to count as a
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
notice but what it just says is a
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
standalone statement I'm remembering I
 
02:26:13.710 --> 02:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
think it was a Tom Hanks movie someone
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
was calling uh uh Tom Hanks and and ends
 
02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
up arguing with him for about a minute
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
and then realizes that it's just an
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
answering machine does that does that
 
02:26:25.030 --> 02:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
mean we're we're just adding this as a
 
02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
standalone that you can't leave a
 
02:26:28.590 --> 02:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
message to call back it's already
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
illegal under federal laws to to do that
 
02:26:34.429 --> 02:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
okay so but then we don't need a state
 
02:26:37.150 --> 02:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
law on top of the federal law well there
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
is some question as to whether or not a
 
02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
phone call made between two parties
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
within the same state uh whether or not
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
the Fair Credit de uh fdcpa
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
applies so yes yes it's it was yeah if
 
02:26:54.190 --> 02:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
you want to strike it fine it's not that
 
02:26:58.269 --> 02:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
important uh but that was just uh
 
02:27:00.429 --> 02:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
reminding people that they can't have a
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
message on the public uh uh phone call
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
and that does not uh address affirmative
 
02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:10.150 align:start position:0%
and that does not uh address affirmative
notification

02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
notification
 
02:27:13.790 --> 02:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
leaving a voicemail message well it's
 
02:27:15.910 --> 02:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
funny that you but you did allow them to
 
02:27:17.990 --> 02:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
leave a you know a big sticker on or
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
post some note on the door so every
 
02:27:23.030 --> 02:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
driving by can see that but but you
 
02:27:24.870 --> 02:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
don't want any message on the answer no
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
but if you notice it also says that that
 
02:27:29.269 --> 02:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
has that has to be done in a solid
 
02:27:32.110 --> 02:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
envelope Mark confidential addressed
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
only with the customer's name I used to
 
02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
work as a merchant Mariner and you'd
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
have a mariner out of the country for a
 
02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
few months at a time and they would pick
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
up their phone and they would have a
 
02:27:42.590 --> 02:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
thing where they' call the uh their own
 
02:27:45.469 --> 02:27:45.479 align:start position:0%
answering machine back home actually
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
have a recorded device there to try to
 
02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
see you know are there any debt
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
collectors or anything so it seems like
 
02:27:52.990 --> 02:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a weird law that sometimes works
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
against you um I would know I've never
 
02:28:00.510 --> 02:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
um done that I know that uh if you're in
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
the Merchant Marine or if you're in the
 
02:28:04.230 --> 02:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
military services you can't collect the
 
02:28:06.670 --> 02:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
debt anyway so
 
02:28:09.150 --> 02:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so I'm gonna do something
 
02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
which I haven't done before but I'm
 
02:28:12.269 --> 02:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
going to say is anybody in the committee
 
02:28:15.070 --> 02:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
room want to have a question have a
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
question and just nothing else I want to
 
02:28:23.269 --> 02:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:25.560 align:start position:0%

02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
up yeah go ahead uh yeah can you hear me
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
okay yes I can okay great um thank you
 
02:30:02.590 --> 02:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
for the time uh my name is Mike boony I
 
02:30:05.349 --> 02:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
work closely with Nick Norman um I'm on
 
02:30:08.670 --> 02:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
his core team um and I'll have to
 
02:30:10.590 --> 02:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
apologize in advance I've never attended
 
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
one of these but I I'm filling in for
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
Nick uh as I said I'm on his core team
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to um we have a
 
02:30:19.030 --> 02:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
statement here and I just wanted to
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
speak real quickly on this one if I
 
02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
could uh okay so you never did the visal
 
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
sign up process okay well I think Nick
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
Nick Norman he's done this many times
 
02:30:32.429 --> 02:30:32.439 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure he we're doing this the
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
first time so he knows that he's done it
 
02:30:36.990 --> 02:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
many times better than us there this is
 
02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
our first day doing this so um I guess
 
02:30:41.230 --> 02:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
the question I would have is is do you
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
mind just having that submitted to the
 
02:30:45.309 --> 02:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
committee you know that if it's a if
 
02:30:47.269 --> 02:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
it's a written testimony that you're or
 
02:30:50.349 --> 02:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
a written statement you can certainly uh
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
go through and have it submitted to the
 
02:30:56.790 --> 02:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
committee but yep uh Nick may have done
 
02:30:58.630 --> 02:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
that already but I can certainly follow
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
up with him and make sure I have the
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
right person and we can get that
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
submitted no problem okay okay because I
 
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
I don't I mean I don't know we do have
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
the time but I guess um my preference
 
02:31:12.990 --> 02:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
would be for you to just submit it uh
 
02:31:15.309 --> 02:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
because you don't and because I'm not
 
02:31:17.950 --> 02:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
terms of I I could promote you to have
 
02:31:20.830 --> 02:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
you testify but um is it if it's
 
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
important to you that you speak you know
 
02:31:24.830 --> 02:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
see everybody when you testify but
 
02:31:26.590 --> 02:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise if you're willing to submit it
 
02:31:28.190 --> 02:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
that'd be
 
02:31:32.309 --> 02:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
great all right uh yeah go
 
02:31:35.269 --> 02:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
ahead no I I just I I was just gonna say
 
02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's only it's only like a paragraph it
 
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
would probably take 30 seconds but if I
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
understand your time your time is of the
 
02:31:43.150 --> 02:31:43.160 align:start position:0%
essence so we can certainly just submit
 
02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
um we do have a little time because we
 
02:31:47.309 --> 02:31:47.319 align:start position:0%
have nobody else U was testifying so if
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
you want to go ahead and and read that
 
02:31:50.830 --> 02:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph into the file that's great but
 
02:31:53.269 --> 02:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
you do I guess I don't know Pam can he
 
02:31:55.349 --> 02:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
submit his name later afterwards so at
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
least we know who his information yes if
 
02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
he goes to the um the website on the
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
general the general court website and
 
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.389 align:start position:0%
general the general court website and
and

02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
registers today um he'll be included in
 
02:32:11.950 --> 02:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
the the testifying list okay great all
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
right so go ahead and uh with your with
 
02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:14.870 align:start position:0%
right so go ahead and uh with your with
your

02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
testimony okay um so I I guess the
 
02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
concerns we have is by the time
 
02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
the the bill goes into collection the
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
debtor is well aware of the debt um the
 
02:32:27.309 --> 02:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
bill is also not practical because it's
 
02:32:29.950 --> 02:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
making creditors give notice to debtors
 
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
before referral to a collection agency
 
02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
when the Creditor may not even know the
 
02:32:37.469 --> 02:32:37.479 align:start position:0%
address or location and that's really
 
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
the tough thing is that for
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
landlords where we have a person who
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
leaves owing rent without notice it's
 
02:32:46.870 --> 02:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
difficult if not impossible to even give
 
02:32:48.830 --> 02:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
this notice because former tenants they
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
they oftentimes especially if they owe
 
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
money you you don't know their
 
02:32:53.349 --> 02:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
forwarding address you don't even know
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
where they went um so um you know
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
tenants in such circumstances you know
 
02:33:00.590 --> 02:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
they don't leave their forwarding
 
02:33:02.630 --> 02:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
address uh they may have moved out of
 
02:33:05.429 --> 02:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
state and the collection agencies with
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
additional resource uh may be able to
 
02:33:10.429 --> 02:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
locate a formal ten former tenant but
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
smaller landlords you know without such
 
02:33:15.309 --> 02:33:15.319 align:start position:0%
resources they may not have that ability
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
um in enactment of this bill basically
 
02:33:20.309 --> 02:33:20.319 align:start position:0%
says to write off the debt by making it
 
02:33:22.590 --> 02:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
impossible to provide the notice so you
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
know if you can't fulfill this notice
 
02:33:25.830 --> 02:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
because you don't know where they are
 
02:33:28.590 --> 02:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
then you can't really you know seek seek
 
02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
the debt and I just have kind of a quick
 
02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
proposal and maybe something a little
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
different is we're all required to send
 
02:33:38.190 --> 02:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
the security deposit back or at least a
 
02:33:40.349 --> 02:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
security deposit statement showing where
 
02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
their funds went so
 
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps to propose this is to say that
 
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
after 30 days after they moved out you
 
02:33:53.070 --> 02:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
send well I just lost you somehow you're
 
02:33:56.830 --> 02:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
you're after days beyond that if you
 
02:33:58.349 --> 02:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
haven't heard back from them and they've
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
made no contact and no effort to pay the
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
debt then uh allow the landlord to to
 
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
hire a collected agency that way it's
 
02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's a passive type the clerk is not
 
02:34:11.230 --> 02:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
able to hear yeah I can't I cannot hear
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
you you're all of a sudden I don't know
 
02:34:15.630 --> 02:34:15.640 align:start position:0%
you're when whether your microphone or
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
something just suddenly uh died out on
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
us um so yep can you can can you hear me
 
02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
sorry yes okay go ahead sorry what what
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
was the sorry what was the last bit you
 
02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
heard the Bluetooth and went out H yeah
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
right um maybe it's just best that at
 
02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
this point you submit your your
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
testimony uh to the committee and and
 
02:34:40.590 --> 02:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll look at it from there okay
 
02:34:43.269 --> 02:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you no problem all right so I have

the testimony is going on um yeah I am
 
02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
one of those people I apologize is it
 
02:35:20.269 --> 02:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
possible that you could submit it in or
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
do you want to take uh five minutes and
 
02:35:25.309 --> 02:35:25.319 align:start position:0%

02:35:27.550 --> 02:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh I I'll be faster than five minutes
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm from New Hampshire Legal
 
02:35:32.190 --> 02:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
Assistant we're a nonprofit Law Firm we
 
02:35:33.870 --> 02:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
provide free legal representation to
 
02:35:35.269 --> 02:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
low-income families and seniors across
 
02:35:37.710 --> 02:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um I am
 
02:35:40.429 --> 02:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of this bill I I
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
do think there is an important benefit
 
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
to Consumers to receiving notice prior
 
02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
to something being referred to
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
collections um and uh representative
 
02:35:54.349 --> 02:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
Bartlett raised a good question of well
 
02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
if they've already received notice that
 
02:35:58.190 --> 02:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
they owe the money why do they need a
 
02:35:59.950 --> 02:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
separate notice that it's going to
 
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
collections and I think that there there
 
02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
is an important distinction when
 
02:36:07.150 --> 02:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
something moves from just a debt owed to
 
02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
being sent to collections because the
 
02:36:12.590 --> 02:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
the sending of a debt to collections has
 
02:36:14.950 --> 02:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
a concrete negative impact on the
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
consumer um even if once it is sent to
 
02:36:20.269 --> 02:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
collections they pay off that debt
 
02:36:23.550 --> 02:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
immediately to the collection company uh
 
02:36:26.990 --> 02:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
there is a lasting impact on their FICO
 
02:36:30.429 --> 02:36:30.439 align:start position:0%
8 score from that debt being referred to
 
02:36:32.190 --> 02:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
collections even if they they have paid
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
it um and I one of the areas of law that
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
I work in at nhla is I run a a clinic
 
02:36:43.269 --> 02:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
for for uh debtors in the Candia
 
02:36:45.070 --> 02:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
District Court once a month or at least
 
02:36:48.429 --> 02:36:48.439 align:start position:0%
they did before the pandemic and quite
 
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
frequently I would meet with people who
 
02:36:53.550 --> 02:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
said I I thought I had paid this credit
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
card already or I thought I had paid
 
02:36:58.030 --> 02:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
this medical bill and I I thought it had
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
already been resolved and then I got
 
02:37:03.269 --> 02:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
this notice from the court I I I was not
 
02:37:04.670 --> 02:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
I was under the impression that I had
 
02:37:08.429 --> 02:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
paid this and my conversations with
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
these people indicate that many times
 
02:37:13.110 --> 02:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
had they been aware that something was
 
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to be sent to
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
collections that they thought had
 
02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
already been resolved in one way or
 
02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
another they would take actions to get
 
02:37:22.150 --> 02:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
that resolved before going to
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
collections but either it is an older
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
debt or it is a debt that was mixed up
 
02:37:29.070 --> 02:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
with another debt that they had paid off
 
02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
and they weren't certain of exactly
 
02:37:34.469 --> 02:37:34.479 align:start position:0%
where the status of the debt going to
 
02:37:37.389 --> 02:37:37.399 align:start position:0%
collections was um I I do think there is
 
02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
a concrete benefit to people getting
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
that that notice before a negative
 
02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
action is taken and I I'll note that a
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
very similar process to what is proposed
 
02:37:50.269 --> 02:37:50.279 align:start position:0%
here is done by the utility
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
when they are pursuing a a late or
 
02:37:55.269 --> 02:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
unpaid utility bill you know they when
 
02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
they are when a debt is owed they will
 
02:38:01.469 --> 02:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
send out a a pass to Bill notice but
 
02:38:03.389 --> 02:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
before they move to do the negative
 
02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
impact of the the disconnect on the
 
02:38:09.630 --> 02:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
utility customer they send a disconnect
 
02:38:13.630 --> 02:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
notice either by phone as described here
 
02:38:16.389 --> 02:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
or um a posting in an envelope on a door
 
02:38:20.910 --> 02:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
as is an option here it's it helps
 
02:38:23.389 --> 02:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
provide clear notice that a a
 
02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
substantial negative impact will happen
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
to the customer and um I think there's a
 
02:38:32.190 --> 02:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
benefit to that um beyond that I I won't
 
02:38:35.269 --> 02:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
say whether or not this particular bill
 
02:38:39.870 --> 02:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
is the the most perfectly tailored means
 
02:38:42.030 --> 02:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
of addressing that concern but I do
 
02:38:43.510 --> 02:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
think it does address that
 
02:38:46.269 --> 02:38:46.279 align:start position:0%
concern thank you great all right well
 
02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and and I hope you
 
02:38:49.469 --> 02:38:49.479 align:start position:0%
will submit that testimony so we have
 
02:38:52.950 --> 02:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
have it in our files for us okay I'll be
 
02:38:56.150 --> 02:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
happy so uh Jeffrey I see that you
 
02:38:57.790 --> 02:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
represent gon you have your hand up you
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
have a question yes sir thank you Mr
 
02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and I think my question would
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
probably be best answered by
 
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative erery uh and and
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
represent does have his hand up so
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
normally I would give if we have the
 
02:39:14.590 --> 02:39:14.600 align:start position:0%
time I would give a sponsor a final bite
 
02:39:16.469 --> 02:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
Apple at this point representative URI
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
do you want who uh do you want to say
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
something uh and and take take another
 
02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
question yes I will take a question okay
 
02:39:30.429 --> 02:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
go ahead can I have a
 
02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion yes go ahead oh you take the
 
02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
question yes so represent you can ask
 
02:39:37.309 --> 02:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
the question to rep okay thank you and
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
this goes to the uh the statement
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
concerning landlords trying to reach
 
02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
tenants that they don't have an uh
 
02:39:47.389 --> 02:39:47.399 align:start position:0%
forwarding address uh for uh if I
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
understand uh representative illery
 
02:39:53.349 --> 02:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
your the requirement is only that the
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
Creditor provides affirmative
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
notification and that can be a certified
 
02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.120 align:start position:0%
letter that they could send by mail to
 
02:40:06.070 --> 02:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
the last known mailing address of the in
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
this case the tenant now delivery is not
 
02:40:12.349 --> 02:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
required so if they and and certified
 
02:40:14.790 --> 02:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
mail is usually not forwarded uh only
 
02:40:16.429 --> 02:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
that the attempt was made it is
 
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
certified so that the Creditor the in
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
this case the land Lord would have
 
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
affirmative notice I did send this
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
notification but that it didn't get
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
delivered is not on me and it's not the
 
02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
fault of the Postal Service it's just I
 
02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
sent it to the last known to be in
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
compliance with this law I sent it to
 
02:40:35.870 --> 02:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
the last known mailing address and
 
02:40:37.550 --> 02:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's all that's required of me is that
 
02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:39.479 align:start position:0%
an accurate
 
02:40:41.790 --> 02:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
description uh yes and thank you for the
 
02:40:43.790 --> 02:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
question that would be an accurate
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
description it would be a benefit to the
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
small land uh owner plan
 
02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:53.110 align:start position:0%
small land uh owner plan
damn

02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
damn
 
02:40:57.110 --> 02:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
phone uh it would be a benefit to the uh
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh landlord because it would give him
 
02:41:02.230 --> 02:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to say particularly with
 
02:41:04.269 --> 02:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
the returning of the funds I've made
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
this attempt this it's documenting the
 
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
attempts that have made I would also
 
02:41:12.389 --> 02:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
suggest to the small land um landlord
 
02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:16.430 align:start position:0%
that there's a simple skip Trace hack
 
02:41:16.430 --> 02:41:17.870 align:start position:0%
that there's a simple skip Trace hack
[Music]

02:41:17.870 --> 02:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:20.190 --> 02:41:20.200 align:start position:0%
um boy you ow lots of money to the
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
committee now yeah
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
well I'm at home I'm not in the
 
02:41:27.389 --> 02:41:27.399 align:start position:0%
committee room uh the what would
 
02:41:30.429 --> 02:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
happened is that uh if you take the
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
envelope and if you put down on the
 
02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
requested you will get the new
 
02:41:43.349 --> 02:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
address of the um person who was moved
 
02:41:46.110 --> 02:41:46.120 align:start position:0%
away from the house that's just a skip
 
02:41:50.670 --> 02:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
Trace hack that uh that is in there
 
02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
so it's just one of the ways you can uh
 
02:41:55.870 --> 02:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
find out that new address but at any
 
02:41:59.030 --> 02:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
rate uh to answer your question directly
 
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
representative gon yes the attempt is
 
02:42:05.510 --> 02:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
the key thing and if it helps a person
 
02:42:09.389 --> 02:42:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh as was indicated by uh the uh uh
 
02:42:11.670 --> 02:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer that spoke earlier it's
 
02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
benefiting everyone and uh I think it
 
02:42:18.429 --> 02:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
benefits both the debtor and it uh
 
02:42:22.950 --> 02:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
Creditor okay is that answer your
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
question representative gson uh yes sir
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
thank you okay well put your hand down
 
02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh and I have another hint of this uh uh
 
02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
Rick blae did you I see your hand is
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
still up is that can you hear me now yes
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
we can oh I'm sorry about earlier today
 
02:42:45.429 --> 02:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
and I did go online and register it was
 
02:42:48.269 --> 02:42:48.279 align:start position:0%
easy oh good um but I'm in opposition as
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
a landlord again uh it's the eviction
 
02:42:52.670 --> 02:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
process when we go through a district
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
court for an eviction notice to have the
 
02:42:57.550 --> 02:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
tenant removed at the same time we get a
 
02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
rid of possession we get a collection
 
02:43:03.269 --> 02:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
meaning the judge basically orders the
 
02:43:05.950 --> 02:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
payment so basically we we already
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
circumvented the notice process because
 
02:43:10.110 --> 02:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
we went through the eviction process but
 
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
from a creditor perspective that tenant
 
02:43:16.110 --> 02:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
now is being told by the judge to pay
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
and it becomes a judgment against the
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
tenant on their credit
 
02:43:23.269 --> 02:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
so I guess this is creating a quagmire I
 
02:43:26.349 --> 02:43:26.359 align:start position:0%
understand that the intent of the bill
 
02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
but from a landlord's perspective it's
 
02:43:30.190 --> 02:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
also becoming part of judicial process
 
02:43:32.550 --> 02:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
now on the eviction notice when we go
 
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
before a
 
02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
judge that's all I wanted to a
 
02:43:40.590 --> 02:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation for your testimony thank
 
02:43:43.630 --> 02:43:43.640 align:start position:0%
you all right uh I guess now I have no
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
more hands up so I'm G to hopefully we
 
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh have worked this one and so I will uh
 
02:43:58.469 --> 02:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
read the blue sheet here and um I have
 
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
sure I have the right bills is 109 yeah
 
02:44:04.750 --> 02:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
good uh Michael McCary um is a lobbyist
 
02:44:07.590 --> 02:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
from Collectors Association as opposed
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
to the bill um Tom pla uh represented
 
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
pla uh is um supports the bill uh Ellen
 
02:44:21.150 --> 02:44:21.160 align:start position:0%

texted Rich to get him to
[Laughter]

04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:07:38.950 --> 04:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
mute I actually screwed up when he did
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
have his hand
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
up and what was happening was is that I
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
I have to be careful that when I look at
 
04:07:47.710 --> 04:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
my panelist list they have to keep
 
04:07:50.910 --> 04:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
pulling scrolling down so that I can um
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
as long as me and pammer is still at the
 
04:07:54.790 --> 04:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
top that means I can see because when
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
you raise your hand you immediately bump
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
to the top of the list yeah so I you
 
04:08:04.149 --> 04:08:04.159 align:start position:0%
need you need a bigger computer John I I
 
04:08:08.149 --> 04:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
got a 17 screen how much bigger do you
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
want takes up a lot of desk
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
space but I do have a second I have a
 
04:08:16.109 --> 04:08:16.119 align:start position:0%
huge computer so I can have everything
 
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
on there and it doesn't take any yeah
 
04:08:21.550 --> 04:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
one of those Big Mac Mac screens there I
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
liked it when when I was when I was
 
04:08:25.229 --> 04:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
still working we had three monitors you
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
know three screens so we could move from
 
04:08:30.149 --> 04:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
one to another it was great I loved it I
 
04:08:31.510 --> 04:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have that kind of room on
 
04:08:34.030 --> 04:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
my desk like a traffic controller yeah
 
04:08:37.070 --> 04:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
it felt that way some
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
days so were we allowed to have beer
 
04:08:41.189 --> 04:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
during the
 
04:08:46.269 --> 04:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
hearing soda soda me too I got the
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
same right doesn't show that you have
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
well it counts to where you are you have
 
04:08:55.750 --> 04:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.429 --> 04:08:58.439 align:start position:0%
yeah and then what if your phone rings
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
do you have to pay five bucks that's
 
04:09:06.109 --> 04:09:06.119 align:start position:0%
right well if we had a coffee fun but uh
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
I I had my phone un mute and then all of
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
a sudden it wasn't on mute so I I must
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
have in my frustration throwing papers
 
04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
around I must have taken them mute off
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
the phone so I bet Chris Maier doesn't
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
know that rule he does now I told
 
04:09:24.189 --> 04:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
him well then the other the the the
 
04:09:27.149 --> 04:09:27.159 align:start position:0%
fuzziness of his beard or hand oh
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
Stapleton yeah that was weird I kept
 
04:09:32.790 --> 04:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
thinking because it was so consistent
 
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
that it was like a phone thing you know
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
like a phone glitch but you know ter I
 
04:09:36.720 --> 04:09:38.750 align:start position:0%
like a phone glitch but you know ter I
don't

04:09:38.750 --> 04:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:09:41.670 --> 04:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
know if he has a mic right down below
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
and he was shuffling his papers or
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
something it could have been something
 
04:09:47.469 --> 04:09:47.479 align:start position:0%
like that I don't even know where my mic
 
04:09:49.990 --> 04:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
is I don't know how anybody can do this
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
stuff on their phones and stuff like
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
that absolutely how do you one of the
 
04:09:56.469 --> 04:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
important lessons I've learned over the
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
years is that the apps on your phone are
 
04:10:01.910 --> 04:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
not the same apps on your computer it's
 
04:10:03.469 --> 04:10:03.479 align:start position:0%
it's a different
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
app and so and and what's on your phone
 
04:10:10.510 --> 04:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
is is stripped down it's you know it's
 
04:10:14.189 --> 04:10:14.199 align:start position:0%
Dom Minimus and um and so I won't order
 
04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
things I won't do any I just I will not
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
do them on my phone CU I well just a
 
04:10:18.960 --> 04:10:19.950 align:start position:0%
do them on my phone CU I well just a
puny

04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
puny
 
04:10:23.429 --> 04:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
and K I think it takes practice too
 
04:10:25.070 --> 04:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
because I know occasionally I'll call my
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
son in in the UK and if I catch him you
 
04:10:30.189 --> 04:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
know if he's out somewhere I'll pick it
 
04:10:31.990 --> 04:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
up on the phone and he knows how to do
 
04:10:34.590 --> 04:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
it well yeah you but simple things like
 
04:10:36.830 --> 04:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
that is fine you know I mean I do
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
FaceTime and I know the person's picking
 
04:10:42.269 --> 04:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
up so but what about teachers ordering
 
04:10:44.830 --> 04:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
stuff teachers teachers have to deal
 
04:10:46.830 --> 04:10:46.840 align:start position:0%
with they have to go into the school
 
04:10:48.750 --> 04:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
teach the students in the school and
 
04:10:50.630 --> 04:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
teach the people that are the students
 
04:10:54.109 --> 04:10:54.119 align:start position:0%
that are remote at the same time not
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
easy so Jane that's how the hybrid thing
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
works is that they're teaching the same
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
class but some of there and some aren't
 
04:11:04.870 --> 04:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
yes oh boy that's nuts I thought it was
 
04:11:04.880 --> 04:11:05.790 align:start position:0%
yes oh boy that's nuts I thought it was
different

04:11:05.790 --> 04:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:11:08.429 --> 04:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
days yeah in in Manchester the uh
 
04:11:11.070 --> 04:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
seniors went back to school
 
04:11:14.229 --> 04:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and then slow the other you
 
04:11:18.750 --> 04:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
know students will go in but uh um prek
 
04:11:22.149 --> 04:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
through second or third have been in
 
04:11:25.030 --> 04:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
schools all
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
along to send them was closed because of
 
04:11:34.130 --> 04:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
Co yeah right right the metrics the
 
04:11:34.140 --> 04:11:35.950 align:start position:0%

won't do anything on a
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
Friday I I I have never in my career
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
have ever done anything on a Friday I
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
was counting on that no I I mean I would
 
04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
owe always you know go either side of
 
04:12:48.429 --> 04:12:48.439 align:start position:0%
the Tuesday Wednesday Thursdays and me
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
one year we really did have you know I
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
think you were talking about we had like
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
80 70 80 bills and I was able to just
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
squeeze them all in there and just get
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
it done but I the idea of you know
 
04:13:00.550 --> 04:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
Mondays and Friday mean I'm on the
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
county my County delegation we're do
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
Monday mornings but which is now
 
04:13:06.630 --> 04:13:06.640 align:start position:0%
conflicting with the Chairman's meetings
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
right exactly so that's why I made this
 
04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
one Friday because um our leadership
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
will be on Mondays when you're having
 
04:13:16.389 --> 04:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
your chairs and vice chairs okay so uh
 
04:13:19.550 --> 04:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the public hearing on uh
 
04:13:23.149 --> 04:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
number if it's Tuesday it must be
 
04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
Belgium okay so this is House Bill 313
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
oh this one boy I all of a sudden my
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
mail is blowing up under the list okay
 
04:13:37.149 --> 04:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
so 313 so um I'll ask the sponsor to
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
raise his hand so that I can I can
 
04:13:43.149 --> 04:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
invite him to speak there he is okay and
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm now promoting to panelist
 
04:13:49.030 --> 04:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
Glenn and good afternoon and uh welcome
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%

Committee nice
 
04:14:09.550 --> 04:14:09.560 align:start position:0%

Glenn Glenn you can hear me or you're
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
you're muted
 
04:14:19.670 --> 04:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.680 --> 04:14:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
know

04:14:23.109 --> 04:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:26.710 --> 04:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh I dare try to un oh there you
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%

04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
continue what you were saying I'm
 
04:14:41.950 --> 04:14:41.960 align:start position:0%
inviting you to speak and introduce your
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
bill okay okay I appreciate yall taking
 
04:14:46.830 --> 04:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
the time to hear this bill I think it's
 
04:14:50.109 --> 04:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
pretty important there are homeowners
 
04:14:53.790 --> 04:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
associations that are really tough and
 
04:14:56.429 --> 04:14:56.439 align:start position:0%
uh let me get back into what ham radio
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
is it's a very important thing if some
 
04:15:02.229 --> 04:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
some of you may know when uh emergencies
 
04:15:05.550 --> 04:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
arise such as Katrina
 
04:15:08.429 --> 04:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
911 Boston bombings they have to fall
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
back on ham radio and we have volunteers
 
04:15:14.830 --> 04:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
all over the country to help with that
 
04:15:16.990 --> 04:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
the problem is that you have to practice
 
04:15:19.630 --> 04:15:19.640 align:start position:0%
this stuff in order to be good and uh
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
you have emergencies to have to come up
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
your batteries go dead you gotta think
 
04:15:27.630 --> 04:15:27.640 align:start position:0%
on the on the Fly and and uh go so the
 
04:15:29.469 --> 04:15:29.479 align:start position:0%
problem with some of the home owners
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
associations is they will not allow a
 
04:15:32.560 --> 04:15:33.710 align:start position:0%
associations is they will not allow a
single

04:15:33.710 --> 04:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
single
 
04:15:37.590 --> 04:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
antenna I wish I could show you uh but I
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
guess I can't I don't know why my dog's
 
04:15:42.550 --> 04:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
up there but I've got a camera here but
 
04:15:42.560 --> 04:15:43.670 align:start position:0%
up there but I've got a camera here but
anyway

04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
04:15:46.030 --> 04:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
I I've got an antenna here that's 12 in
 
04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
I've got one some of you may remember
 
04:15:51.070 --> 04:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
the old um when you had your nice
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
stereos your cwoods how you had that
 
04:15:55.830 --> 04:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
antenna come up and then it would tee
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
off to the sides I have a one here I
 
04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
wish I could show you that's illegal
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
they if they see that that you've
 
04:16:06.670 --> 04:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
violated the rules and all we're asking
 
04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
for is um a reasonable accommodation I
 
04:16:13.469 --> 04:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
have another one that's 80
 
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
feet long but it connects to your house
 
04:16:19.630 --> 04:16:19.640 align:start position:0%
and then you can take the other end to a
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
tree and with that all you see is a
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
piece of wire that is less than an
 
04:16:29.229 --> 04:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
eighth of an inch thick but it's 88 feet
 
04:16:31.950 --> 04:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I mean nobody could ever pick it
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
up so I just you know we we're trying to
 
04:16:37.710 --> 04:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
make a reasonable accommodation and I
 
04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
would like to make uh one other comment
 
04:16:42.670 --> 04:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
before we go on is I have an amendment
 
04:16:44.510 --> 04:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the process I'm not sure how
 
04:16:45.790 --> 04:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
that's all working I haven't been
 
04:16:49.389 --> 04:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
emailed yet but in the bill on section
 
04:16:53.469 --> 04:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
one uh Part D it says uh let me get let
 
04:16:56.309 --> 04:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
me get to it here antenna support
 
04:16:58.229 --> 04:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
structure means a structure such as a
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
tower Pole or Mast used to support one
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
or more
 
04:17:07.429 --> 04:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
antennas the amendment removes the word
 
04:17:10.950 --> 04:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
tower there will be no Tower just uh
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
like a flag pole can be turned into an
 
04:17:17.149 --> 04:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
a g her but we don't want a tower so
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:25.070 --> 04:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
removed thank you okay um do any members
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee have a have a
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
question and uh representative Bartlet
 
04:17:34.109 --> 04:17:34.119 align:start position:0%
you may thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
coming before our committee um
 
04:17:38.070 --> 04:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative Aldrich um we had this
 
04:17:41.429 --> 04:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
bill um a couple of years ago and we
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
retained it in committee and then it was
 
04:17:47.149 --> 04:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
killed um one of the problems that that
 
04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
I have with the bill is that this bill
 
04:17:53.790 --> 04:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
would override what a homeowners
 
04:17:57.550 --> 04:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
association is already agreed to for
 
04:18:02.550 --> 04:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
their um members and I I do have a
 
04:18:07.149 --> 04:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
problem with that and you I obviously
 
04:18:09.750 --> 04:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
the intent of the bill is to override
 
04:18:11.790 --> 04:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
what the homeowners association has
 
04:18:13.830 --> 04:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
already agreed to
 
04:18:16.149 --> 04:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
yes you believe is that what you believe
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
or yes that's true and believe me uh I'm
 
04:18:24.189 --> 04:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
not sure who's on there but I am far
 
04:18:27.389 --> 04:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
from uh one to get the government
 
04:18:28.630 --> 04:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
involved with something I'm more
 
04:18:32.510 --> 04:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
inclined to get them out but the with
 
04:18:34.870 --> 04:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
the importance of ham radio in
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
emergencies all we're asking for is a
 
04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable combination like I was trying
 
04:18:42.269 --> 04:18:42.279 align:start position:0%
to say the the the first two antennas
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
that I met mention would be in your
 
04:18:47.429 --> 04:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
house but they're illegal they would can
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
find you or whatever the rules they have
 
04:18:52.590 --> 04:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
and I just I don't think that's fair and
 
04:18:56.510 --> 04:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
I think that you know uh they don't ever
 
04:18:58.750 --> 04:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
make the reasonable accommodations for
 
04:19:01.590 --> 04:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
it and I think that they should so as
 
04:19:03.030 --> 04:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
much as I hate getting government
 
04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
involved I have to you know for this
 
04:19:08.750 --> 04:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
plus I G to I didn't get a chance to
 
04:19:11.950 --> 04:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
look it up but there's a federal bill
 
04:19:15.790 --> 04:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
that would allow uh the same and more
 
04:19:18.269 --> 04:19:18.279 align:start position:0%
because that's how important the uh FCC
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
thinks that it is and if we get further
 
04:19:22.469 --> 04:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
down the line I'll I'll get that
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
information for
 
04:19:30.870 --> 04:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
hton thank you and thank you for taking
 
04:19:36.030 --> 04:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
my question I'm looking at the first
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
page um of the bill and I'm looking
 
04:19:41.630 --> 04:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
under Community Association which is the
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
definitions uh section and it basically
 
04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
says this is line 13 commonly known as
 
04:19:50.429 --> 04:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
Homeowner Association now I live in a
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
condo I live in a condo association uh
 
04:19:56.070 --> 04:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
is there an attempt to to bring all of
 
04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
those different umbrellas under the term
 
04:20:00.670 --> 04:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
Community Association or or is that
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
something that will hamper your
 
04:20:05.910 --> 04:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh I'm I'm not sure could you
 
04:20:07.630 --> 04:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
repeat the question for me please yeah
 
04:20:09.550 --> 04:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
maybe I need to back up a step what is
 
04:20:11.229 --> 04:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
the difference between a homeowners
 
04:20:13.469 --> 04:20:13.479 align:start position:0%
association and a condo
 
04:20:15.510 --> 04:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
Association or is there a difference
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
because I believe there
 
04:20:20.469 --> 04:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
is well I I didn't I I don't know that
 
04:20:25.109 --> 04:20:25.119 align:start position:0%
there is or there isn't um but I don't
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
see why it would shouldn't apply to both
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
you're asking for a reasonable
 
04:20:32.309 --> 04:20:32.319 align:start position:0%
accommodation for an antenna uh even
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
some of the bigger ones can be in your
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
attic but under the HOA rules they are
 
04:20:40.750 --> 04:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
illegal I
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
mean it just I mean it's it's very
 
04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
important that emergency communications
 
04:20:49.670 --> 04:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
exist cell towers they use the uh they
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
shut them down because bombers can call
 
04:20:54.269 --> 04:20:54.279 align:start position:0%
in with cell phones so it's a very
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
important thing and we have to be able
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
to practice it you just can't jump in uh
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
to an emergency when you haven't been
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
able to practice turn your radio on you
 
04:21:06.750 --> 04:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
don't know that it
 
04:21:09.389 --> 04:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
works uh so that that's the important
 
04:21:11.149 --> 04:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
thing is the practice and that's why we
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
need a reasonable accommodation
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
we we meant to pull that Towers out of
 
04:21:18.030 --> 04:21:18.040 align:start position:0%
there because we all know what towers
 
04:21:19.710 --> 04:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
are they're big they're
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
ugly everything that we're trying to get
 
04:21:26.109 --> 04:21:26.119 align:start position:0%
in this bill is minimal it's hard to see
 
04:21:27.790 --> 04:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
eighth of an inch wire even though it's
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
88 feet and if it's black it Blends in
 
04:21:33.070 --> 04:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
almost all the time I have one that's
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
copper and it's tainted through the
 
04:21:39.550 --> 04:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
years to that green that the copper gets
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it's barely noticeable and that's
 
04:21:44.870 --> 04:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to get is to allow
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
people to uh be able to practice with
 
04:21:50.149 --> 04:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
something that isn't going to mess up
 
04:21:53.550 --> 04:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the beauty of of your
 
04:21:56.070 --> 04:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
neighborhood follow up please yeah
 
04:21:58.189 --> 04:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
follow so just to you clarify on your
 
04:22:00.550 --> 04:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
previous question um so yes this would
 
04:22:04.830 --> 04:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
imply to every in both home in if you
 
04:22:07.149 --> 04:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
that says say you weren't really a condo
 
04:22:09.750 --> 04:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
but you had a you know some kind of uh
 
04:22:12.870 --> 04:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh land you know homeowners association
 
04:22:15.109 --> 04:22:15.119 align:start position:0%
it would apply to everybody both of them
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead with your question okay and I'm
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
also looking here and again uh just just
 
04:22:21.790 --> 04:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
to give you some kind of background uh
 
04:22:23.710 --> 04:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'm currently in a condominium unit at
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
this moment there are eight units in the
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
building in which I am this states that
 
04:22:31.910 --> 04:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh common areas such as rooftop um can
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
be used according to your bill would
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
that be somewhat cumbersome if all the
 
04:22:38.389 --> 04:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
eight owners of the units in my building
 
04:22:40.109 --> 04:22:40.119 align:start position:0%
were to do that and would there be any
 
04:22:42.109 --> 04:22:42.119 align:start position:0%
kind of impact to say our cell service
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
or your uh internet service or any of
 
04:22:46.990 --> 04:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of which you're
 
04:22:49.630 --> 04:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
aware um well I'm not really sure about
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the uh condo part but it'd be
 
04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
really unique if all eight people uh put
 
04:23:02.109 --> 04:23:02.119 align:start position:0%
an antenna up there but uh what and they
 
04:23:05.070 --> 04:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
they would be allowed such as uh there's
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
are antennas that are just like the Dish
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
Networks so if you have eight of those
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
with Dish Networks or say seven and one
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have it but they have a ham
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
radio you still have eight Dish Networks
 
04:23:18.870 --> 04:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
up there uh uh
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
dishes and just a quickly follow up if I
 
04:23:23.750 --> 04:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
may uh I did say there are eight units
 
04:23:24.870 --> 04:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
but that means that there are more than
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
eight residents and if each and one of
 
04:23:29.309 --> 04:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
us decided to have a a radio I think the
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
number eight could become Amplified
 
04:23:32.710 --> 04:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and for
 
04:23:35.950 --> 04:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
your I guess I had intervenience if if
 
04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
all eight want to do it and they have
 
04:23:40.389 --> 04:23:40.399 align:start position:0%
the owners then they would vote to say
 
04:23:42.630 --> 04:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
to allow them all do it so the issue
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
really is is what happens if you have a
 
04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
Homeowners Association of eight and you
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
only have one homeowner who wants to do
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
this and the other seven don't want them
 
04:23:57.309 --> 04:23:57.319 align:start position:0%
to screw holes into into the to the roof
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
shingles and they don't want any any
 
04:24:01.389 --> 04:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
antennas or they think their antenna's
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
ugly and I remember the first time I
 
04:24:04.269 --> 04:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
ever one of these bills it was someone
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
who wanted to hang a flag the US flag
 
04:24:09.710 --> 04:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
and he was having he was getting uh um
 
04:24:13.149 --> 04:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
Flack from his his neighbors so so it's
 
04:24:16.830 --> 04:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's the idea of that in this case that
 
04:24:18.670 --> 04:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
if it's a minority because obviously if
 
04:24:19.950 --> 04:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's a majority then there shouldn't be
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:40.109 --> 04:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
Chris he was
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
here there he is
 
04:24:45.670 --> 04:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
um I just a couple of questions Glen
 
04:24:47.790 --> 04:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
because I don't I'm not that uh
 
04:24:50.189 --> 04:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
conversent with ham
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
radios but um I'm curious if an antenna
 
04:24:54.920 --> 04:24:56.710 align:start position:0%
radios but um I'm curious if an antenna
is

04:24:56.710 --> 04:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:24:59.950 --> 04:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
remote uh not on a building say out in
 
04:25:01.229 --> 04:25:01.239 align:start position:0%
the woods
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere uh but it's on common
 
04:25:04.000 --> 04:25:05.670 align:start position:0%
somewhere uh but it's on common
land

04:25:05.670 --> 04:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
land
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh would that would that uh one Tower be
 
04:25:13.229 --> 04:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
able to be accessed
 
04:25:16.750 --> 04:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh by uh multiple ham radio guys or is
 
04:25:21.309 --> 04:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
it uh each each ham radio has a specific
 
04:25:21.319 --> 04:25:22.990 align:start position:0%
it uh each each ham radio has a specific
uh

04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
antenna well uh there first of all let
 
04:25:27.670 --> 04:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
me State there's no Towers that's being
 
04:25:29.830 --> 04:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
removed uh it's already been to
 
04:25:33.070 --> 04:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
legislative Services I called them today
 
04:25:35.269 --> 04:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh but yes everybody needs their own
 
04:25:36.910 --> 04:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
antenna for their own radio just like
 
04:25:38.429 --> 04:25:38.439 align:start position:0%
your car needs an
 
04:25:38.439 --> 04:25:41.229 align:start position:0%
your car needs an
antenna

04:25:41.229 --> 04:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
antenna
 
04:25:41.239 --> 04:25:42.790 align:start position:0%
antenna
um

04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:44.229 --> 04:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
like I said they're not they don't have
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
to be intrusive and ugly no I I uh I
 
04:25:50.830 --> 04:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
voted for your bill to begin with Glen I
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
was just there was just some things that
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
I uh I was interested in because we do
 
04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
have already have Towers they're there
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't I don't see why the state
 
04:26:03.760 --> 04:26:05.269 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't I don't see why the state
cannot

04:26:05.269 --> 04:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
04:26:08.510 --> 04:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
allow just like they allow all those
 
04:26:11.790 --> 04:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
individual uh you know for cell tow uh
 
04:26:15.229 --> 04:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
for cell cellular communication that
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't
 
04:26:21.070 --> 04:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
allow uh or or in fact order uh a
 
04:26:25.229 --> 04:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
network of ham radio towers that would
 
04:26:27.790 --> 04:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
cover the whole
 
04:26:29.990 --> 04:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
state I'm just trying to I'm just trying
 
04:26:32.070 --> 04:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
to see if that's even
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
possible uh the cell towers uh are one
 
04:26:40.429 --> 04:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
thing but the uh handam radio towers we
 
04:26:42.830 --> 04:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
have we have them I I'm president for
 
04:26:44.550 --> 04:26:44.560 align:start position:0%
the central New Hampshire amateur radio
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
club and we have one on Gunstock and we
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
have to turn it down to 19 Watts instead
 
04:26:51.910 --> 04:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
of the 50 that it's capable of because
 
04:26:55.109 --> 04:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
we were interfering with some stations
 
04:26:57.469 --> 04:26:57.479 align:start position:0%
um I think there were radio stations FM
 
04:26:57.479 --> 04:26:58.590 align:start position:0%
um I think there were radio stations FM
in

04:26:58.590 --> 04:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
massachusett okay so so there's an
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
interference problem if you start
 
04:27:06.229 --> 04:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
doing uh well you can you could we
 
04:27:08.750 --> 04:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
worked around that by lowering the power
 
04:27:12.429 --> 04:27:12.439 align:start position:0%
but you still had you know it's it's
 
04:27:14.910 --> 04:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
like the a radio and it is a frequency
 
04:27:17.269 --> 04:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
just like uh FM
 
04:27:20.469 --> 04:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
104.9 okay everybody's radios can tune
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
into that but you can't talk with ham
 
04:27:26.670 --> 04:27:26.680 align:start position:0%
radio we tune into those frequencies and
 
04:27:31.149 --> 04:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you all right great
 
04:27:37.109 --> 04:27:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Terry you're
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
up next for a
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um for
 
04:27:46.309 --> 04:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
those members who are unfamiliar with uh
 
04:27:50.469 --> 04:27:50.479 align:start position:0%
amateur radio or so-called ham radio um
 
04:27:53.710 --> 04:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
amateur radio operators are regulated by
 
04:27:56.510 --> 04:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Federal Communications Commission so
 
04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
these these are not U individuals who
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
are just purchasing equipment and
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
deciding that they're going to uh
 
04:28:05.950 --> 04:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
broadcast uh anywhere within the country
 
04:28:07.990 --> 04:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
or around the world This is highly
 
04:28:10.510 --> 04:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
regulated and has been for decades by
 
04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
the Federal Communications Commission
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh if I may direct a question to
 
04:28:18.510 --> 04:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
representative Aldrich uh did I
 
04:28:22.389 --> 04:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
understand you to say that there are or
 
04:28:25.109 --> 04:28:25.119 align:start position:0%
could be Community
 
04:28:27.710 --> 04:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
associations that
 
04:28:33.309 --> 04:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh individuals from erecting
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
antennas uh no matter how small they may
 
04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
be within their own
 
04:28:41.710 --> 04:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
residences and if that is if that's
 
04:28:41.720 --> 04:28:43.149 align:start position:0%
residences and if that is if that's
correct

04:28:43.149 --> 04:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:28:44.790 --> 04:28:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering on what
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
basis uh legal basis they can they can
 
04:28:50.070 --> 04:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
regulate what you have in your in your
 
04:28:52.349 --> 04:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
own in your own home or your own
 
04:28:56.109 --> 04:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
Dwelling Place um the second question
 
04:28:58.349 --> 04:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
that I have let answer that is um with
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
respect to retained two years ago did I
 
04:29:02.469 --> 04:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
understand that to be the case that the
 
04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
Bill's history was that it was retained
 
04:29:08.590 --> 04:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
two years ago and if so I have a
 
04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
question is that
 
04:29:13.830 --> 04:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
accurate uh I think it was a retain but
 
04:29:16.590 --> 04:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh I really don't recall the
 
04:29:19.630 --> 04:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
details what is the history of this bill
 
04:29:21.309 --> 04:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
is it brand new or does it have a
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
history did uh did I have I don't have
 
04:29:26.630 --> 04:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
my fingertips Pam did you sp send out
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
something on on this it has a history we
 
04:29:32.030 --> 04:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
retained it and then we killed it all
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
right um so can somebody outline for me
 
04:29:38.870 --> 04:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
the outline of the history of this bill
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
it it was representative all I'm sorry I
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
was addressing representative Aldrich or
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
do I have yeah you go ahead you're
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
asking a you're asking him for that he
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative ald were you the one who
 
04:29:52.990 --> 04:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored this legislation
 
04:29:56.429 --> 04:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
previously yes I was and um I don't know
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
if anybody is familiar with the a rrl
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's the American radio relay
 
04:30:06.269 --> 04:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
League um they helped write this bill
 
04:30:09.750 --> 04:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
and uh I think part of the problem was
 
04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh we had a couple people that had test
 
04:30:14.910 --> 04:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
I tried to find it but I couldn't that
 
04:30:17.149 --> 04:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh and I think we uh addressed all the
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
issues the towers is gone and uh you
 
04:30:22.590 --> 04:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
know like I said the whole thing is we
 
04:30:24.389 --> 04:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
just they're they're pretty much like
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
stealth antennas um and we are a lot
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
different than CB anybody can get a CB
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
and can talk all what they want but uh
 
04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
we are FCC regulated our licenses are
 
04:30:41.309 --> 04:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
good for 10 years we uh practice for
 
04:30:42.910 --> 04:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
emergencies and a lot of the events are
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
fun if anybody knows what climb to the
 
04:30:47.710 --> 04:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
clouds is I provide emergency
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
communications for that event as well as
 
04:30:52.950 --> 04:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
about 30 others we that gives us
 
04:30:55.389 --> 04:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
practice out in the field and that's
 
04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
part of what we need to do that's for
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
local stuff the antennas that I'm
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
talking about that are really stealth
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
are for HF I've talked to Colombia
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
Germany Poland and around the world and
 
04:31:10.590 --> 04:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
I don't even do that part of it much I'm
 
04:31:12.950 --> 04:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
more for local emergencies and that's
 
04:31:15.910 --> 04:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
why I started with this and that's why I
 
04:31:18.349 --> 04:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
think this bill is so important that we'
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
be able to practice when that emergency
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
comes that we have
 
04:31:27.189 --> 04:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
the uh done the leg work to have this
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
just step right up and replace
 
04:31:31.149 --> 04:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
everything else that's gone
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
down thank you Mr chairman uh I was
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
attempting to establish a baseline here
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
with respect to the legislation proposed
 
04:31:41.109 --> 04:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
legislation that we have before us and
 
04:31:42.590 --> 04:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
how it may have been similar or
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
different from the legislation that was
 
04:31:46.830 --> 04:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
submitted reportedly submitted in the
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
past and what the objections were uh in
 
04:31:52.950 --> 04:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
the past first asking the sponsor I
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to be misunderstood if there
 
04:31:56.990 --> 04:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
are colleagues who can provide
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
additional information to me and with
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
your um with your permission I'd be
 
04:32:03.070 --> 04:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
happy to hear from them thank
 
04:32:05.830 --> 04:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
you um I guess but I'll I'll interject
 
04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
here um so theoretically I as a someone
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
as a chair I'm not supposed to be
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
telling you how I feel you know this is
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be an open hearing and
 
04:32:16.510 --> 04:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
something like that but I can tell you
 
04:32:18.950 --> 04:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
what the prent was and where I was with
 
04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
this bill and then you can take it for
 
04:32:22.830 --> 04:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
what it's worth um we have another bill
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
coming up later which is um uh adding uh
 
04:32:28.830 --> 04:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
uh installation of solar energy systems
 
04:32:31.550 --> 04:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
to to the roof of a house okay the RH
 
04:32:36.349 --> 04:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
the issue um for me it comes down to is
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
that um when someone buys into a condo
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
or buys into a community organization
 
04:32:46.070 --> 04:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
whether they know it or not um they are
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
buying into a whole new u city or town
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
or you know regulated body that has a
 
04:32:53.670 --> 04:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
democratic process in which they're
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
going to vote for and against things um
 
04:32:59.590 --> 04:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
theoretically if you're someone who uh
 
04:33:01.870 --> 04:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
if you're a ham radio thing I my
 
04:33:03.790 --> 04:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that you would you
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
would check it out before you bought the
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
condo that whether the condo is going to
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
let you put an antenna on the roof or
 
04:33:12.869 --> 04:33:12.879 align:start position:0%
not um and if there if they're not then
 
04:33:14.590 --> 04:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
you probably that's probably not the
 
04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
property you want to buy into um if
 
04:33:19.150 --> 04:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
someone just became ham radio out later
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
on and said GE I want to do ham radio
 
04:33:23.310 --> 04:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
now well it's again it's problematic
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
because you got to get your neighbors
 
04:33:25.869 --> 04:33:25.879 align:start position:0%
you got to get the community you got to
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
get people to go with it and and so in
 
04:33:31.070 --> 04:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
terms of this or the solar on the roof
 
04:33:34.750 --> 04:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
or like that um my my position has
 
04:33:38.109 --> 04:33:38.119 align:start position:0%
always been um you that you know buy or
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
beware when it comes to buying into a
 
04:33:42.269 --> 04:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
homeowners association um you're you're
 
04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
buying into a group of people and and
 
04:33:45.990 --> 04:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
you better you know make sure you've
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
done your homework and making sure that
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
they're okay with what you're doing for
 
04:33:51.551 --> 04:33:51.561 align:start position:0%
the legislature just unilaterally come
 
04:33:54.429 --> 04:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
back and say well notwithstanding the
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
fact that you are a little democracy and
 
04:33:57.310 --> 04:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
you know have a little your own
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
government we're going to tell you what
 
04:34:01.390 --> 04:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
you can or can't do in terms of the
 
04:34:03.789 --> 04:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
rules and that and and that's that's
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
where I would say in the past I have I
 
04:34:08.709 --> 04:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
have voted down these type of bills so
 
04:34:10.869 --> 04:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman you're citing that as one
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the your perception and your
 
04:34:16.189 --> 04:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
recollection that that's one of the
 
04:34:19.230 --> 04:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
major reasons why this bill um was
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
retained and did not Advance yes or no
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
we retained it to try to work through
 
04:34:25.109 --> 04:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
some of the see where there was some
 
04:34:27.150 --> 04:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
issues to be worked through and and at
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
the end of the day we ended up um not
 
04:34:32.429 --> 04:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
voting uh not for future recommend uh
 
04:34:34.109 --> 04:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
future legislation and and was the
 
04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
opposition extended to um inside as well
 
04:34:37.039 --> 04:34:38.349 align:start position:0%
opposition extended to um inside as well
as

04:34:38.349 --> 04:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
outside the idea that you have an
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
antenna inside your house like for
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
instance I always thought well because a
 
04:34:47.150 --> 04:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
lot of them they have a little roof it's
 
04:34:49.709 --> 04:34:49.719 align:start position:0%
roof in space between the roof and your
 
04:34:52.109 --> 04:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
ceiling that if you stuck it up in there
 
04:34:53.789 --> 04:34:53.799 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to have a good signal I
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
don't know the nuances and all the
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of it but again it is something
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
that this is something you as an
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
individual need to work out with your
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
homeowners association with the group
 
04:35:06.750 --> 04:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
that that that ask the state to
 
04:35:08.830 --> 04:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
intervene seems inappropriate to me Mr
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
chairman some of us are so old here that
 
04:35:12.750 --> 04:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
we may remember rabbit ears on top of
 
04:35:15.029 --> 04:35:15.039 align:start position:0%
our black and white televisions it would
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
seem to me by analogy that the condo
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
associations would also be prohibiting
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
rabbit ears on top of a television set
 
04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
inside someone's house or bedroom thank
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
you very much yeah I I hear you and
 
04:35:29.949 --> 04:35:29.959 align:start position:0%
that's leg question okay so you can put
 
04:35:31.510 --> 04:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
your hand down if you I'll put your hand
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
down for you uh representative ham
 
04:35:33.400 --> 04:35:37.869 align:start position:0%
down for you uh representative ham
you're

04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
next thank you thank you Mr chair um I
 
04:35:45.551 --> 04:35:45.561 align:start position:0%
just wondered and I'm I'm quite familiar
 
04:35:48.670 --> 04:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
with um condominium associations and and
 
04:35:51.029 --> 04:35:51.039 align:start position:0%
you're right it would have to be a
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
majority vote of of all the members in
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
the association to change the
 
04:35:59.750 --> 04:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
association rules um and that would only
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
um address that particular Association
 
04:36:07.990 --> 04:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering um whether I do know
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
um cellular towers we have four of them
 
04:36:14.390 --> 04:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
in um our community and and there's
 
04:36:17.029 --> 04:36:17.039 align:start position:0%
about probably to be two more in the
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
general area to get good Communications
 
04:36:24.109 --> 04:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
up and down the valley and I do know um
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
because I'm chair of the planning board
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
that um we cannot uh say no to anything
 
04:36:35.629 --> 04:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
that's Homeland Security that's that
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
enhances Emergency Services we have to
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
make provision for uh police uh and
 
04:36:45.269 --> 04:36:45.279 align:start position:0%
those kinds of Emergency Services now I
 
04:36:49.910 --> 04:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't know whether um amateur radios
 
04:36:53.670 --> 04:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
Falls within that and that maybe um a
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
regulation change I do know it's
 
04:37:00.189 --> 04:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
FCC and we're we're regulated by FCC
 
04:37:03.629 --> 04:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
also I don't know whether um and they do
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
provide uh a a service in emergencies
 
04:37:09.551 --> 04:37:09.561 align:start position:0%
they are recognized as an integral part
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
of Emergency Services in case of uh any
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a Homeland Security or emergency
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
situation so you know I don't know
 
04:37:21.390 --> 04:37:21.400 align:start position:0%
whether there needs to be FCC regulation
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
changes so therefore this technology
 
04:37:26.670 --> 04:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
ends up on those telecommunication
 
04:37:29.189 --> 04:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
Towers or whether this is an important
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
enough service that perhaps the
 
04:37:35.869 --> 04:37:35.879 align:start position:0%
community might um provide that kind of
 
04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
a service they have Towers on top of
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
their um police what is your what is
 
04:37:42.990 --> 04:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
your question I'm sorry uh so my
 
04:37:46.189 --> 04:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
question is is that is that the way to
 
04:37:47.789 --> 04:37:47.799 align:start position:0%
address it it's certainly not going to
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
get addressed on on the the um
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
Association condominium side of things
 
04:37:58.070 --> 04:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
but is it an important enough Public
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
Service safety issue to perhaps um
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
justify uh you know some sort
 
04:38:08.750 --> 04:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
of in other places in the law holy
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
dude oh yeah that's the big key your
 
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
need to uh mute oh I'm
 
04:38:13.840 --> 04:38:20.310 align:start position:0%
need to uh mute oh I'm
[Laughter]

04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:24.109 --> 04:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
sorry and and Chris you need to mute
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
also oh am M I'm sorry I thought I yeah
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay all right um so so uh so um
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
your your question representative ham is
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
is is this could be done some other way
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
rather than uh forcing just uh
 
04:38:45.551 --> 04:38:45.561 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations to deal with the
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
problem uh representative Aldridge you
 
04:38:49.990 --> 04:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
want to respond to that yeah there's
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
there's no way uh that we could like do
 
04:38:55.949 --> 04:38:55.959 align:start position:0%
the towers I mean we have we have what
 
04:38:58.349 --> 04:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
are called repeaters and that's good for
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
local stuff and what a repeater
 
04:39:02.750 --> 04:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
basically does it can take a five watt
 
04:39:05.709 --> 04:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkie radio it sends it up to
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
the tower the tower transmitted at uh
 
04:39:10.349 --> 04:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere up to 50 Watts like I said
 
04:39:12.949 --> 04:39:12.959 align:start position:0%
earlier we had to back ours down on gun
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
stock to 19 or 16 Watts so we didn't
 
04:39:18.750 --> 04:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
have interference so I mean we always
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
taking this stuff into consideration and
 
04:39:25.390 --> 04:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh I I think it's it's very important uh
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
to uh get to representative hams point
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
when if we had a three-week ice storm or
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
any other natural storm that we've had
 
04:39:37.948 --> 04:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
uh we could only be faced with ham radio
 
04:39:40.750 --> 04:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
and just so that you know in Katrina we
 
04:39:43.590 --> 04:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
have a relay system so if you have a
 
04:39:46.590 --> 04:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
family member in that was in the
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
hurricane and you didn't hear anything
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
we can relay a message from one H to the
 
04:39:54.110 --> 04:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
next and it just goes all down the line
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
we get a message somebody will drive to
 
04:39:57.070 --> 04:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
your house and try to find you if we
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
have to or the police station and then
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
they'll relay a message all the way back
 
04:40:04.670 --> 04:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
up and I can tell you uh that you know
 
04:40:06.868 --> 04:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
your family members fine we found them
 
04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
at the you know the local shelter and
 
04:40:11.708 --> 04:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
everything's good so it's a very
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
important for emergencies and it's very
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
important to practice you just can't
 
04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
throw a kid a keys to the car and expect
 
04:40:23.948 --> 04:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
them to operate like uh somebody that
 
04:40:26.788 --> 04:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
knows how to drive and in order to do
 
04:40:28.708 --> 04:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
that he has to have some practice so he
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
goes to school or his parents teach him
 
04:40:34.110 --> 04:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be but I would I'm
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
telling you I I Mr chair you especially
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
I understand your point of view on it I
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be the same way I mean I've had
 
04:40:43.230 --> 04:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
Liberty friends what other things you
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
want the government to get you know and
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
I'm like you know this one is really
 
04:40:48.670 --> 04:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
important or I wouldn't be doing it
 
04:40:51.788 --> 04:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
believe me fair enough thank you you all
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
said representative
 
04:40:59.110 --> 04:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:02.510 --> 04:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
next uh thank you um the upper area of
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
my I'm in a floal and the northern third
 
04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
of my florial is basically condos uh and
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
condo associations and I'm always
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
Fielding questions about these I find
 
04:41:14.110 --> 04:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
that many of the constituents who live
 
04:41:15.788 --> 04:41:15.798 align:start position:0%
here are quite territorial about
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
associations therefore my question is
 
04:41:20.550 --> 04:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
this um who would be the enforcement
 
04:41:23.788 --> 04:41:23.798 align:start position:0%
agency and to whom would the penalties
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:30.910 --> 04:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
go well that's a good question uh
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have a good answer
 
04:41:36.510 --> 04:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
on that one I can certainly research it
 
04:41:39.070 --> 04:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh you want to know who's going to
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
enforce it well in the leg isation it it
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
does indicate charges or penalties that
 
04:41:46.910 --> 04:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
are assessed and uh I don't know if the
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
association the condo association would
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
be the enforcement agency or if this
 
04:41:53.708 --> 04:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
falls into some kind of departmental
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
element of legislation um and who
 
04:41:57.990 --> 04:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
collects the money and who keeps the
 
04:41:59.190 --> 04:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
money is the other point of that
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
question they would have to the the home
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
homeowners association would have to
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
take that homeowner to to court it it
 
04:42:09.550 --> 04:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
does may I follow up it does say that
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
there are charges or penalties
 
04:42:15.030 --> 04:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
that precede any kind of Court action so
 
04:42:18.910 --> 04:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh yeah I'm not a lawyer nor do I
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
pretend to be one so it might be a
 
04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
missing element of this and deeds and
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know if you're trying to sue
 
04:42:30.030 --> 04:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
somebody for deed so the statute is
 
04:42:32.788 --> 04:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
under you one one person would takeen
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
the other person to court so right but
 
04:42:36.868 --> 04:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
it again there is that step before going
 
04:42:39.030 --> 04:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
to court which involves charges and
 
04:42:40.750 --> 04:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
penalties I just want to know who's
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
who's preview that is who who handles
 
04:42:45.190 --> 04:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
that who keeps the money maybe that's
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
why we retained it the last time okay
 
04:42:50.230 --> 04:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
all right thank you the answer to that
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative all
 
04:42:56.270 --> 04:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
right uh representative AEL you're next
 
04:42:59.230 --> 04:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for uh for
 
04:43:02.750 --> 04:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony today um uh
 
04:43:04.708 --> 04:43:04.718 align:start position:0%
representative Aldrich I believe you
 
04:43:07.868 --> 04:43:07.878 align:start position:0%
said that you were either the prime
 
04:43:11.310 --> 04:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor or uh one of the co-sponsors of
 
04:43:14.110 --> 04:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
this bill when it came before us early
 
04:43:16.910 --> 04:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh in earlier sessions is that
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
correct yes it is we uh we knew there
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
was some issues so we re worked it it's
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
not the same bill and like I said so far
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
uh the only part that I've seen is wrong
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
is that the you know the towers uh will
 
04:43:36.750 --> 04:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
not be there that word will be removed
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
and uh as soon as I get the I don't know
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
if they'll send it to you guys or to me
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
or what but I called and made that uh
 
04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
request this morning when I saw follow
 
04:43:47.708 --> 04:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
follow up please for the question
 
04:43:51.628 --> 04:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you um as I recall then
 
04:43:54.948 --> 04:43:54.958 align:start position:0%
the earlier bill and I somehow think it
 
04:43:57.230 --> 04:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
it came before us
 
04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
twice um uh was that the earlier Bill
 
04:44:05.310 --> 04:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
did include towers that were re pretty
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
tall maybe a hundred feet or more and
 
04:44:12.670 --> 04:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
that most of the the objection as I
 
04:44:18.628 --> 04:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
recall was to to that um so this would
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
be a different bill because it doesn't
 
04:44:23.990 --> 04:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
have that and I don't recall there being
 
04:44:26.270 --> 04:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I will get to my question I
 
04:44:30.510 --> 04:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
hope okay um I don't recall there being
 
04:44:33.788 --> 04:44:33.798 align:start position:0%
discussion of of interior antennas that
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
were not visible
 
04:44:39.788 --> 04:44:39.798 align:start position:0%
outside of uh the homeowner's property
 
04:44:41.750 --> 04:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
um so that would be something we would
 
04:44:44.150 --> 04:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
need to look into that would we not I
 
04:44:47.070 --> 04:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
that would be uh to to narrow it down to
 
04:44:48.990 --> 04:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
something that that no one else can see
 
04:44:50.590 --> 04:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's inside your
 
04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
unit um that that would I would venture
 
04:44:55.550 --> 04:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
to say you probably can do that now with
 
04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
no problems because nobody else in the
 
04:44:59.390 --> 04:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
homeowners association will know you
 
04:45:03.510 --> 04:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
have one so well not entirely true if
 
04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
for some reason they needed to come in
 
04:45:08.708 --> 04:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
and see it it's against the rules and to
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
get back to those rules real quick all
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
those were pretty much cookie cutter
 
04:45:15.990 --> 04:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
somebody came up with it and they pretty
 
04:45:17.550 --> 04:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
much use the same thing I live in a
 
04:45:21.150 --> 04:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
mobile home park and a co-op and all the
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
co-ops they they almost always do the
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
same thing so then we have to go and to
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
our rules committee and change them
 
04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
individually but they try to come in and
 
04:45:32.868 --> 04:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
do them and the homeowners associations
 
04:45:36.110 --> 04:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
do not like changing the rules like the
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
people you know that actually own the
 
04:45:42.590 --> 04:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
co-op so do you have uh an an anecdotal
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
story in which a homeowners association
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
actually enforced this uh an prohibit
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
hams for someone who had an antenna
 
04:45:56.150 --> 04:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
inside their house I don't but I can
 
04:45:57.910 --> 04:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
certainly look for that I I would hope
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
so because I mean because like I say I'm
 
04:46:02.750 --> 04:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
hardpressed to believe that there's ever
 
04:46:04.310 --> 04:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
that that that if any Homeowner
 
04:46:06.430 --> 04:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
Association in terms of we've seen the
 
04:46:09.310 --> 04:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
rules are usually because you had you
 
04:46:11.830 --> 04:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
built something on the out outside of
 
04:46:13.868 --> 04:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
the building and put it on the roof or
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
the siding I mean we had one bill the
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
guy was he had a snow blow he was
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
snowblowing his backyard so his dog
 
04:46:23.110 --> 04:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
would have a place to go and the
 
04:46:25.070 --> 04:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners association the condo
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
association cracked down on him because
 
04:46:29.230 --> 04:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
they said you're not allowed to snow
 
04:46:32.910 --> 04:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
snow blow on your lawn but um other on
 
04:46:34.270 --> 04:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
their lawn which is the obviously
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
Community own so I guess if I I I I I I
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
would be at least for myself personally
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
I would might feel a little bit
 
04:46:45.070 --> 04:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
different if you could show me that that
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
that actual homeowners association was
 
04:46:50.190 --> 04:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
so anti-am that they would not even
 
04:46:52.548 --> 04:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
allow you to have an antenna inside your
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
house if you could find one of those
 
04:46:58.628 --> 04:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
stories I'd be interested in it so uh I
 
04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
don't see oh representative gon
 
04:47:04.750 --> 04:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
sorry oh thank you chairman and thank
 
04:47:07.628 --> 04:47:07.638 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Aldrich uh I I I
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
think what I'm hearing is a misunder
 
04:47:13.830 --> 04:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
standing on maybe not amongst everyone
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
here today but maybe amongst the public
 
04:47:18.430 --> 04:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
and especially the homeowners
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
associations of the type of equipment
 
04:47:22.830 --> 04:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
that might be installed the types of
 
04:47:26.548 --> 04:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
antennas uh that would be installed uh I
 
04:47:27.868 --> 04:47:27.878 align:start position:0%
think they have this picture in their
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
mind those unsightly antennas uh aerial
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
antennas like we had back as you know
 
04:47:36.470 --> 04:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
back in the day uh and I think that's
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
what they or the or the small satellite
 
04:47:40.868 --> 04:47:40.878 align:start position:0%
or even the huge satellite dishes that
 
04:47:43.548 --> 04:47:43.558 align:start position:0%
that uh you know Megaton uh satellite
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
antennas uh so just could you describe
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
the type of equipment antennas or
 
04:47:52.590 --> 04:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
whatever that would that be uh that
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
could possibly be installed on the
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
outside of the house that would be
 
04:48:00.030 --> 04:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
considered quote unsightly that is
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
usually in the Aesthetics of a
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
homeowners association that they would
 
04:48:06.350 --> 04:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
be the that would be the the source of
 
04:48:08.310 --> 04:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
the objection how is this different from
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
those Aerials from the 70s
 
04:48:14.868 --> 04:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
well they're mostly Towers uh for
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
example the thin wire I was telling you
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
about that can be dropped in a gutter it
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
could be hung From a
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
Balcony uh it can be go from your
 
04:48:27.548 --> 04:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
balcony like I said a a a piece of just
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
electric wire less than an eighth of an
 
04:48:36.070 --> 04:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
inch that's 80 to 160 feet can just go
 
04:48:38.590 --> 04:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
from your place to a tree and hardly
 
04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
ever be seen they have flag po antennas
 
04:48:44.830 --> 04:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
that tune up to certain frequencies on
 
04:48:48.670 --> 04:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
on there um did did I miss one of your
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh questions on
 
04:48:53.590 --> 04:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
that no that seemed like is it no I I
 
04:48:55.628 --> 04:48:55.638 align:start position:0%
all all I'm just getting at was the fact
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
that I think that there's just a
 
04:48:59.230 --> 04:48:59.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of of the actual type
 
04:49:00.990 --> 04:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
of equipment I having lived in a
 
04:49:04.030 --> 04:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners association before uh
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
everything is all about seems to be
 
04:49:07.830 --> 04:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
about Aesthetics and aerial antennas and
 
04:49:11.230 --> 04:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
satellite dishes are big no no uh that
 
04:49:14.310 --> 04:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
in the color of your house and so I'm
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
sorry well I just if you can being able
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
to express the exact type of of
 
04:49:22.788 --> 04:49:22.798 align:start position:0%
equipment that would be installed I
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
think is is you know why they would I
 
04:49:27.390 --> 04:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
think that's what they have in mind and
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why there are these objections
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's just ignorance on their part so
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
well the the uh uh like the Direct TV
 
04:49:36.990 --> 04:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
those dishes I don't know I think
 
04:49:38.310 --> 04:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
they're kind of small compared to the
 
04:49:41.030 --> 04:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
other ones they can actually be used for
 
04:49:42.910 --> 04:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
that and I don't think homeowners
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
associations bar them do they again it's
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
really any individual Association what
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
they had decide and what they put in
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
there um based upon what you just
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
described to me I could see some
 
04:50:01.548 --> 04:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
Association not liking 100 foot wire
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
stringing from the side of the building
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
to a tree um because that's that's just
 
04:50:08.190 --> 04:50:08.200 align:start position:0%
like the guy who was snowplowing the
 
04:50:11.350 --> 04:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
path for his dog um you know that I can
 
04:50:13.868 --> 04:50:13.878 align:start position:0%
see an association having an issue with
 
04:50:15.868 --> 04:50:15.878 align:start position:0%
just a wire yeah because it's anything
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
exterior because I think uh
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative gon's hit it right on the
 
04:50:22.670 --> 04:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
nail it's it's Aesthetics and and and
 
04:50:24.548 --> 04:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if you get into a
 
04:50:27.310 --> 04:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
homeowners association you have to know
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
that some homeowners are very particular
 
04:50:31.750 --> 04:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
about what they think their the
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics of their outside of their
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
building are to not only the color you
 
04:50:37.590 --> 04:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
know the what you're painting or you
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
know the you know what type of shingle
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
they have on the roof I mean they can
 
04:50:43.948 --> 04:50:43.958 align:start position:0%
get really you picky UN about it so I
 
04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
assume that's what maybe what the issue
 
04:50:48.628 --> 04:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
is but I don't know well that was just
 
04:50:50.670 --> 04:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
one like I said you can drop that same
 
04:50:54.990 --> 04:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
wire in a gutter and depending on how
 
04:50:56.788 --> 04:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
long your gutters are you can tune that
 
04:50:59.910 --> 04:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
up too uh I mean I probably shouldn't
 
04:51:02.350 --> 04:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
have thrown that wire in except for it
 
04:51:03.470 --> 04:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
is so
 
04:51:05.670 --> 04:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
small I guess you'll have to give us an
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
example we probably need some more
 
04:51:09.548 --> 04:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
anecdotal you know anecdotal stories of
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
what's going on in New Hampshire have
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
you how about how about actually exists
 
04:51:17.270 --> 04:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
how about just for an idea an extension
 
04:51:19.150 --> 04:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
cord you know the like the cheap brown
 
04:51:21.708 --> 04:51:21.718 align:start position:0%
ones that's they're
 
04:51:24.150 --> 04:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
connected yeah they might have rules
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
about Christmas lights and say well it's
 
04:51:30.030 --> 04:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's one of those that's the thickness
 
04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
and actually it's thinner than that than
 
04:51:35.270 --> 04:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
one of not if you cut that in half and
 
04:51:37.510 --> 04:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
had the two pieces it's smaller than
 
04:51:40.030 --> 04:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
that okay I I think we get it I think
 
04:51:44.310 --> 04:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right um are you all set Jeff
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
represent GRE you're all set I'm all set
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
thanks I'm I'm familiar with amateur
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
radio with numerous friends who are
 
04:51:52.270 --> 04:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
involved so I I know I know all the
 
04:51:53.670 --> 04:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
equipment that they use and that sort of
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
thing so yeah okay I've also been a
 
04:51:58.430 --> 04:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
homeowners association so I know all
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
about those
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
two okay repres Parlin you're next thank
 
04:52:06.190 --> 04:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
you um I'm sorry but I I I guess I have
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
to go back to the flag pole type Tower
 
04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
so are you saying
 
04:52:14.788 --> 04:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
that if I I live in a homeowners
 
04:52:17.030 --> 04:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
association we've paid for underground
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
utilities but if this bill goes through
 
04:52:24.150 --> 04:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
you can put out a flag pole with 180
 
04:52:28.110 --> 04:52:28.120 align:start position:0%
feet whatever of wire to this flag pole
 
04:52:31.310 --> 04:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
no and this bill would keep would would
 
04:52:33.150 --> 04:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
force the homeowner association to
 
04:52:36.868 --> 04:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
accept it no ma'am if you have if your
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
homeowners association doesn't object to
 
04:52:43.110 --> 04:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
having flag pole and you would have to
 
04:52:44.628 --> 04:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
probably go to your town and make sure
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
if you had or the well certainly to the
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners association that probably to
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
the town because if you're going to put
 
04:52:52.830 --> 04:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
a flag pole in you're going to have to
 
04:52:56.590 --> 04:52:56.600 align:start position:0%
be digging in that dirt so as long as
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's uh no objection for that you
 
04:53:00.150 --> 04:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
would probably have to get a permit
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
you'd have to certainly get the
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
homeowners appro uh Association approval
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
but it's just a standard looking
 
04:53:11.910 --> 04:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
Standalone flag pole has a wire running
 
04:53:12.910 --> 04:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
up the
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
shaft and could be brought into
 
04:53:19.070 --> 04:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
underground or along the ground depend
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
on how close it was to your house where
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
you would never even know it was
 
04:53:25.190 --> 04:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
anything other than a flag pole so
 
04:53:26.750 --> 04:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing attached to it except
 
04:53:29.230 --> 04:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
the flag on the
 
04:53:33.190 --> 04:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
outside okay thank you okay um so we do
 
04:53:35.470 --> 04:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
have other people uh testimony but I I
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
do see some more hands up I assume
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're all secy uh Joyce did you have a
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:45.590 --> 04:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
Aldridge yeah I don't want to be
 
04:53:47.830 --> 04:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
laborist but thank you for letting me
 
04:53:50.708 --> 04:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
just Express one thing uh I hear that
 
04:53:52.670 --> 04:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
you're really that uh representative
 
04:53:54.390 --> 04:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
Aldrich you're really trying to make it
 
04:53:56.670 --> 04:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
seem as though this is not
 
04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
objectionable but in your in your bill
 
04:54:03.708 --> 04:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
on page two lines 13 through 16 you talk
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
about electrical
 
04:54:08.670 --> 04:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
enclosures ground mounted control
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
enclosures and guide wire anchors that
 
04:54:13.150 --> 04:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
screened and I if they're visible from
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
the street and it this sounds a little
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
bit like more than just a
 
04:54:24.548 --> 04:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
wire what are we talking about screening
 
04:54:27.548 --> 04:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
here that I'm sorry for that the I'll
 
04:54:30.270 --> 04:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
have to get another amendment uh any
 
04:54:32.350 --> 04:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
guide wires would be going to Towers
 
04:54:34.708 --> 04:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
which we took out I just I just didn't
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
catch that part but thank you for for me
 
04:54:40.948 --> 04:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
and I'll correct that okay thank you
 
04:54:44.430 --> 04:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so like say we have uh some
 
04:54:46.628 --> 04:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
more people who would like to speak so
 
04:54:49.750 --> 04:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Terry you uh you just
 
04:54:52.990 --> 04:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
heard a question rever one minute y if
 
04:54:54.990 --> 04:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman
 
04:54:56.670 --> 04:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
representative Aldrich um as someone
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
who's familiar with amateur radio um I I
 
04:55:01.350 --> 04:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
can see that there are members that are
 
04:55:01.360 --> 04:55:02.670 align:start position:0%
can see that there are members that are
struggling

04:55:02.670 --> 04:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
struggling
 
04:55:05.948 --> 04:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
today visually they're trying to picture
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
this so would you forward to the
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
chairman uh maybe three or four five
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
photographs that would be expressive
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
visually of what you have in mind in
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
terms of what the bill would would
 
04:55:22.750 --> 04:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
permit or required to be permitted I
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
think that would be enormously helpful
 
04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
if we could have everybody see exactly
 
04:55:30.030 --> 04:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
what um what you have in your mind right
 
04:55:33.990 --> 04:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
now thank you that would be no problem
 
04:55:36.990 --> 04:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
I'm uh I don't know what's going on I
 
04:55:39.548 --> 04:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
don't know why my dog's up here but I I
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
I can see s to the right you have to get
 
04:55:44.110 --> 04:55:44.120 align:start position:0%
on your video and change your video
 
04:55:46.070 --> 04:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
settings yeah well I was afraid I'd lose
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
you guys but if we can get towards the
 
04:55:52.350 --> 04:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
end I can yeah send up you know send to
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
the committee U some photos of what
 
04:55:55.750 --> 04:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about that would be
 
04:55:58.548 --> 04:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
helpful I they to I certainly will I
 
04:56:00.030 --> 04:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
could show you right now I have them
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
right here but I'll send them sure thank
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
you that'd be great thank you and Les uh
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
representative V hton did you w to do
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
this again or you want to wait till we
 
04:56:12.390 --> 04:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
get some other people know I just want
 
04:56:13.788 --> 04:56:13.798 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I have a a
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
clarification of something that I
 
04:56:18.628 --> 04:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
referred to earlier um I live in a condo
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
eight units I live on the lower floor
 
04:56:22.628 --> 04:56:22.638 align:start position:0%
there's a floor above me if the
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
gentleman above me had an antenna of
 
04:56:27.430 --> 04:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
this sort up for his uh amateur radio is
 
04:56:28.750 --> 04:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
there any chance that there would be any
 
04:56:30.628 --> 04:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
interference to my cell phone to my
 
04:56:32.830 --> 04:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
cable to my internet to any of that sort
 
04:56:34.670 --> 04:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
or would I be free of that possibility
 
04:56:34.680 --> 04:56:36.030 align:start position:0%
or would I be free of that possibility
of

04:56:36.030 --> 04:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:56:39.270 --> 04:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
interference well the only time that the
 
04:56:42.910 --> 04:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
the FCC is very clear anytime there's
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
any interference like that you have to
 
04:56:48.430 --> 04:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
shut down immediately and then try to
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
find the cause and if you can't uh
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
ascertain what it is then you cannot
 
04:56:56.510 --> 04:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
fire it back up so no there will be no
 
04:56:59.230 --> 04:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh interference for any of that stuff
 
04:57:02.350 --> 04:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
cell phones the only really the only
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
time anything like that would even
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
probably most likely be and remotely
 
04:57:11.670 --> 04:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
happen is if somebody had like a th000
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
2,000 watt uh uh Power and I run most of
 
04:57:20.750 --> 04:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
us run a 100 or less so there's been no
 
04:57:22.350 --> 04:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
issues with
 
04:57:26.190 --> 04:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you great thank you very much
 
04:57:29.350 --> 04:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh so now well uh representative m is uh
 
04:57:31.350 --> 04:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
I've just moved you over to the panelist
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
so um you're free
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
to Welcome to the Commerce Committee
 
04:57:39.788 --> 04:57:39.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman hunt and the members
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the commit
 
04:57:43.310 --> 04:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh and appreciate your time with the uh
 
04:57:46.948 --> 04:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
issue here I want to make two uh points
 
04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
one is that I live here at a condo in
 
04:57:52.070 --> 04:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I have my antenna
 
04:57:54.990 --> 04:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
totally confined to my limited common
 
04:57:57.750 --> 04:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
elements it's all my back porch looks
 
04:58:00.110 --> 04:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
like a bird feeder my nerv get curious
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
what's that say it's part of my weather
 
04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
station but I also use it for radio
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
which is true so I think one compromise
 
04:58:08.868 --> 04:58:08.878 align:start position:0%
you might consider if we're get stuck on
 
04:58:11.788 --> 04:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
the outside of effects of the antennas
 
04:58:13.750 --> 04:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
is to say let's keep it to the limited
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
common elements of the property it's on
 
04:58:18.350 --> 04:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
your back portch and it's only in your
 
04:58:20.190 --> 04:58:20.200 align:start position:0%
back courts it can't go anywhere else in
 
04:58:22.030 --> 04:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
the building anywhere else outside of
 
04:58:22.040 --> 04:58:23.030 align:start position:0%
the building anywhere else outside of
the

04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
building but I did want to talk on the
 
04:58:28.190 --> 04:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
second point anecdotally about the uh
 
04:58:31.350 --> 04:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
value of having trained radio operators
 
04:58:33.948 --> 04:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
available for public surface and Public
 
04:58:37.948 --> 04:58:37.958 align:start position:0%
Safety and I'll speak to the 2013 Boston
 
04:58:41.110 --> 04:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
Marathon I served for about 20 years as
 
04:58:44.270 --> 04:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
a radio operator for Boston Marathon in
 
04:58:46.590 --> 04:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
2013 I was assigned to
 
04:58:49.350 --> 04:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
dispatch dispatch means I've had about
 
04:58:51.868 --> 04:58:51.878 align:start position:0%
half a dozen red cross stations and some
 
04:58:51.878 --> 04:58:53.230 align:start position:0%
half a dozen red cross stations and some
water

04:58:53.230 --> 04:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
water
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
stations at the Red Cross stations I
 
04:58:57.670 --> 04:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
have one person who's assigned to the
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
station Chief always be in their site
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
another person looking at the school bus
 
04:59:06.430 --> 04:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
pickup points for runers becoming uh
 
04:59:07.628 --> 04:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
exhausted to the point they can't
 
04:59:09.270 --> 04:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
continue anymore where do they go we
 
04:59:10.948 --> 04:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
direct them to the school bus pickup
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
point then I have a third operator who's
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
a floater his job is to make sure that
 
04:59:16.510 --> 04:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
everybody else is doing their job and
 
04:59:18.270 --> 04:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
he's got his eyes and ears out looking
 
04:59:20.708 --> 04:59:20.718 align:start position:0%
for problems typically we see Runners
 
04:59:22.750 --> 04:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
going down the course with distress we
 
04:59:24.990 --> 04:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
with a call from a station up the course
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
saying Runner bib number so and so is
 
04:59:29.270 --> 04:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
appears to be in distress We'll advise
 
04:59:31.548 --> 04:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
our station chief of a runner that's
 
04:59:33.110 --> 04:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be monitored we'll pass that
 
04:59:38.070 --> 04:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
along and uh if necessary uh call for an
 
04:59:40.708 --> 04:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh in 2013
 
04:59:44.948 --> 04:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
typical marathon runner race uh TV was
 
04:59:46.830 --> 04:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
on for a few hours they show Runners
 
04:59:48.430 --> 04:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
going up Heartbreak Hill do some ancd
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
Donal interviews and they shut it down
 
04:59:51.910 --> 04:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
and go to daytime programming but now
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're busy because most of the runners
 
04:59:56.110 --> 04:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
are not Elite Runners most of the
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
runners are pretty good Runners but they
 
05:00:01.270 --> 05:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
get tired and we get a lot of calls from
 
05:00:02.868 --> 05:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
the medical stations
 
05:00:06.030 --> 05:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
to uh get supplies get treatments and
 
05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes call for an
 
05:00:10.190 --> 05:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
ambulance in 2013 we got a call from
 
05:00:15.590 --> 05:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
station and crew chief that um go silent
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's been two bombs that went off in
 
05:00:19.470 --> 05:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
Boston don't say anything on the air but
 
05:00:19.480 --> 05:00:20.510 align:start position:0%
Boston don't say anything on the air but
be

05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
ready then we got our
 
05:00:24.910 --> 05:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
instructions instructions are stop the
 
05:00:28.110 --> 05:00:28.120 align:start position:0%
runners at the Red Cross
 
05:00:30.350 --> 05:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
station and we explained that to the
 
05:00:32.190 --> 05:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
crew chief who probably knows it already
 
05:00:35.350 --> 05:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
but we're there to help direct traffic
 
05:00:38.830 --> 05:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
look for problems and assist so in my
 
05:00:41.190 --> 05:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
sector the runners were then assigned to
 
05:00:42.590 --> 05:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
the Newton City Hall where there school
 
05:00:46.430 --> 05:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
buses to pick them up and take them to
 
05:00:49.310 --> 05:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
the next point from there but the
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
important point of the training here is
 
05:00:55.230 --> 05:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
that you need to have experience passing
 
05:00:58.830 --> 05:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
traffic bath and forth about situations
 
05:01:01.628 --> 05:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
in clear manner concise and the people
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
who need to
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
know and having a radio station at your
 
05:01:08.350 --> 05:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
house gives you that training does it
 
05:01:10.750 --> 05:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
have to be elaborate but you need to be
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
able to run drills where you have to
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
understand what's being talked about
 
05:01:18.430 --> 05:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
which is complicated information copy it
 
05:01:21.230 --> 05:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
clearly mark it down and and send that
 
05:01:24.430 --> 05:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
in as a report these are called somewh
 
05:01:27.230 --> 05:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
contest uh but there's a a lot of
 
05:01:29.788 --> 05:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
intense activity to do this training and
 
05:01:31.990 --> 05:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
Report accurately so I hope the
 
05:01:34.548 --> 05:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
committee will support the bill in the
 
05:01:37.750 --> 05:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
context of adding amateur radio
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
operators to the balance of Public
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
Safety people as backup we're not the
 
05:01:45.788 --> 05:01:45.798 align:start position:0%
primary Communications but we're the
 
05:01:48.110 --> 05:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
backup Communications so things go bad
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
there's people available to pass traffic
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
and to respond properly if they're call
 
05:01:58.548 --> 05:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman great thank you
 
05:02:01.590 --> 05:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
um does anybody have a questions okay uh
 
05:02:03.548 --> 05:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
Connie representative van hton you have
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
a question yes thank you Mr chair and
 
05:02:07.548 --> 05:02:07.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um please
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
excuse my ignorance and and I really
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
know very a little about this um are
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
most amateur radio operators involved in
 
05:02:15.708 --> 05:02:15.718 align:start position:0%
networks of the type that you're talking
 
05:02:17.990 --> 05:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
about or is that something that happen
 
05:02:21.390 --> 05:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
sporadically in terms of community
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
need yeah we're actually called the
 
05:02:26.470 --> 05:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
amateur radio service so the basis of
 
05:02:29.390 --> 05:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
getting your license is for service
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's many ways to do that some people
 
05:02:34.110 --> 05:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
do experiments with new technologies
 
05:02:35.470 --> 05:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
digital modes of
 
05:02:37.948 --> 05:02:37.958 align:start position:0%
communications uh many operate in local
 
05:02:39.310 --> 05:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
public service events like I've been
 
05:02:39.320 --> 05:02:40.670 align:start position:0%
public service events like I've been
doing

05:02:40.670 --> 05:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:02:43.430 --> 05:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's a wealth of
 
05:02:45.990 --> 05:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities thank you quick followup
 
05:02:47.670 --> 05:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
forther question me inquire are there
 
05:02:49.548 --> 05:02:49.558 align:start position:0%
many people involved in these types of
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
activities or is it just a a small
 
05:02:55.628 --> 05:02:55.638 align:start position:0%
minority oh quite a lot Boston Marathon
 
05:02:58.430 --> 05:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
we have two to 300 ENT radio operators
 
05:02:59.788 --> 05:02:59.798 align:start position:0%
we have at the Finish
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
Line um where they were very busy in
 
05:03:04.910 --> 05:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
2013 because the cell towers were shut
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
down as was pointed out uh when there's
 
05:03:10.510 --> 05:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
a penny problem and there's preps radio
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
controlled bombs Shel Towers go down
 
05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
need backup Communications we were part
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
of that system there certainly private
 
05:03:18.750 --> 05:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
radios that were used but we were part
 
05:03:20.110 --> 05:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
of that
 
05:03:22.230 --> 05:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
backup uh at the beginning of the course
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
there's a whole another activity going
 
05:03:27.310 --> 05:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
on mustering all the runners uh separate
 
05:03:29.948 --> 05:03:29.958 align:start position:0%
whole project they're up most of the
 
05:03:32.430 --> 05:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
night but they go home early and then
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
most people like myself are in the
 
05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
middle of the course between the the
 
05:03:39.150 --> 05:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
initial rounding up of the runners the
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
start of the race with the Wheelchairs
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then the uh Elite Runners and then
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
the regular Runners it last till about
 
05:03:48.948 --> 05:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
5:00 at night we're in about 12 hours
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for indulging me I
 
05:03:52.830 --> 05:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
really didn't know what thank you um
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
representative mcclear do you have a
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
question yeah I don't mean to show my
 
05:03:59.590 --> 05:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
ignorance but uh I'm familiar with
 
05:04:01.948 --> 05:04:01.958 align:start position:0%
marine radio which is obviously portable
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
I always thought of ham radio is being a
 
05:04:06.868 --> 05:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
single station and not mobile but the
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
way you're talking it sounds like you're
 
05:04:12.430 --> 05:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
mobile yeah it ranges from the handheld
 
05:04:14.670 --> 05:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkies to a Mobile station in
 
05:04:17.670 --> 05:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
your car to a home station that we're
 
05:04:20.190 --> 05:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
talking about on this bill
 
05:04:25.110 --> 05:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
today it's it's a broad band so okay uh
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Bill it's nice to
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
see you again and so next uh I'll ask uh
 
05:04:35.830 --> 05:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
let's see who Bob bets if you there
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
raise your
 
05:04:42.628 --> 05:04:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
I don't see in a hand raised Bob bets
 
05:04:46.708 --> 05:04:46.718 align:start position:0%
are you
 
05:04:50.750 --> 05:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
around um next is Fred poppen gter
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
didn't I see that name Fred yeah Fred
 
05:04:55.230 --> 05:04:55.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak okay good thank
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.070 --> 05:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
speaking and welcome you're still muted
 
05:05:11.548 --> 05:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
and welcome to the Congress committee
 
05:05:12.990 --> 05:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much uh chairman
 
05:05:15.590 --> 05:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
hunt uh I wanted to say a few things and
 
05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
and be very brief the opposition that um
 
05:05:21.708 --> 05:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
you will hear to this kind of a bill is
 
05:05:25.150 --> 05:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
that uh these antennas are unnecessary
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
but you've heard from representative
 
05:05:29.350 --> 05:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
home that without out outdoor antennas
 
05:05:31.708 --> 05:05:31.718 align:start position:0%
you often have no useful ham radio
 
05:05:33.150 --> 05:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
you'll hear that these
 
05:05:35.070 --> 05:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
antennas can be
 
05:05:37.750 --> 05:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
unappealing but basically we're trying
 
05:05:41.830 --> 05:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
to B design a bill here where these are
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
virtually invisible antennas or they are
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
identical to antennas that are already
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
permitted under federal law like a TV
 
05:05:53.990 --> 05:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
broadcast antenna uh satellite the the
 
05:05:57.628 --> 05:05:57.638 align:start position:0%
tiny satellite dish antenna or a flag
 
05:06:01.430 --> 05:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
pole uh in fact uh CI the Condominium
 
05:06:05.190 --> 05:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
Association uh Institute is in favor of
 
05:06:10.948 --> 05:06:10.958 align:start position:0%
flag poles uh and we can load use a flag
 
05:06:13.390 --> 05:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
pole as an antenna without a need for
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
wires from it you run a feed line to it
 
05:06:20.110 --> 05:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
underground you load the antenna that is
 
05:06:23.990 --> 05:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
the flag pole is the antenna um and you
 
05:06:27.030 --> 05:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
will hear that uh some of this may not
 
05:06:29.750 --> 05:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
even be desirable uh but I suggest to
 
05:06:31.708 --> 05:06:31.718 align:start position:0%
you that for New Hampshire it would
 
05:06:33.708 --> 05:06:33.718 align:start position:0%
provide a training ground for not only
 
05:06:36.750 --> 05:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
emergency skills but also technology
 
05:06:38.670 --> 05:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
skills there's one other thing I'd like
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
to say briefly in that is can the
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
association vote to
 
05:06:45.030 --> 05:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
allow the
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
antennas sadly frequently that's
 
05:06:50.350 --> 05:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
impossible because the
 
05:06:53.430 --> 05:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
prohibition on any amateur radio antenna
 
05:06:55.830 --> 05:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
may be included within the common
 
05:06:57.868 --> 05:06:57.878 align:start position:0%
covenants and restraints that run with
 
05:07:00.350 --> 05:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
the land it may be
 
05:07:05.030 --> 05:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
impossible to change that
 
05:07:08.750 --> 05:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
Covenant unless perhaps you get not just
 
05:07:12.750 --> 05:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
a majority vote but unanimous vote
 
05:07:14.670 --> 05:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
frankly you're looking at something
 
05:07:16.868 --> 05:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
that's impossible there because you may
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
not be able to even get to some of the
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
people who have the vote finally I'll
 
05:07:24.750 --> 05:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
tell you that the kinds of antennas we
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
have proposed in this bill and if we've
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
miswritten it I'd be delighted to
 
05:07:32.190 --> 05:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
rewrite it I'm the guy who typed it out
 
05:07:33.708 --> 05:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm learning things all the time
 
05:07:37.110 --> 05:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
from members of the committee are
 
05:07:39.030 --> 05:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
antennas that are already permitted by
 
05:07:43.270 --> 05:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
federal law for satellite TV or other
 
05:07:46.190 --> 05:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
broadcast or wireless internet reception
 
05:07:47.948 --> 05:07:47.958 align:start position:0%
we're not looking for different kind of
 
05:07:49.110 --> 05:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
antennas we're only looking for
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
permission to use those kinds of
 
05:07:54.510 --> 05:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
antennas for ham
 
05:07:57.868 --> 05:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
radio a wire minimally visible
 
05:08:00.350 --> 05:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
wire if you wanted to limit it to a
 
05:08:02.830 --> 05:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
backyard I'd be happy to work with
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
people on writing that it suggests
 
05:08:08.150 --> 05:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
antennas raised only in darkness and
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
unless somebody can see in the dark
 
05:08:13.110 --> 05:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
there is no aesthetic problem there and
 
05:08:15.510 --> 05:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
antennas perhaps uh no higher than a
 
05:08:17.628 --> 05:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
roof line and in the backyard that
 
05:08:19.948 --> 05:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
cannot be seen from the street and
 
05:08:22.030 --> 05:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
finally the flag poles that are already
 
05:08:24.990 --> 05:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
Allowed by federal law but to be used by
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
amateur radio in other words what we're
 
05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is meet every
 
05:08:32.110 --> 05:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
objection we hear and I hope the
 
05:08:33.788 --> 05:08:33.798 align:start position:0%
committee will consider this bill
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
favorably or work with us to redesign
 
05:08:41.788 --> 05:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
it okay uh is there any questions from
 
05:08:41.798 --> 05:08:43.510 align:start position:0%
it okay uh is there any questions from
the

05:08:43.510 --> 05:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:08:46.470 --> 05:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee and uh I I would correct one
 
05:08:48.510 --> 05:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
thing um we did have this issue many
 
05:08:50.868 --> 05:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
many years ago um that when it comes to
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
Condo Association agreements that that
 
05:08:56.470 --> 05:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
were written in the original Deeds um
 
05:08:59.830 --> 05:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
that it it is an 80% vote that it does
 
05:09:02.190 --> 05:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
not require to be unanimous we did
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
change that uh for for one circumstance
 
05:09:07.110 --> 05:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
then I think it was changed again but so
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
I I I think that that's somewhat a
 
05:09:11.670 --> 05:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
little looser but again um it does
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
require a very super majority um okay I
 
05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
see no more hands raised thank you very
 
05:09:19.628 --> 05:09:19.638 align:start position:0%
much and I have one more hand that's
 
05:09:23.190 --> 05:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
rest it's uh Gary derario which I don't
 
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
have you Gary on my list at all so um I
 
05:09:29.230 --> 05:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
guess what I'd like to do is just I'm
 
05:09:31.868 --> 05:09:31.878 align:start position:0%
gonna allow you to talk so uh are you
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
did you want to sign up for it and
 
05:09:37.150 --> 05:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have a chance to speak or and who
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
do you
 
05:09:38.320 --> 05:09:41.310 align:start position:0%
do you
represent

05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:09:45.830 --> 05:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
and there we go you can speak now Gary
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um and I apologize for
 
05:09:50.948 --> 05:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
for not being signed up in advance I I
 
05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
didn't realize I thought we just needed
 
05:09:56.628 --> 05:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
to get on Zoom um I will try to be brief
 
05:09:59.390 --> 05:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
I am an attorney and I partner with
 
05:10:02.070 --> 05:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
Marcus Rico emeran Brooks my office is
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
in marac New Hampshire I'm actually um
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
speaking in my role as the chairperson
 
05:10:11.628 --> 05:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
of the legislative action committee of
 
05:10:14.310 --> 05:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
the Community Association
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
Institute uh which was referenced
 
05:10:20.190 --> 05:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
previously um you know speaking bluntly
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
I I have to say uh this bill appears to
 
05:10:26.270 --> 05:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
not just infringe upon Association
 
05:10:29.230 --> 05:10:29.240 align:start position:0%
rights but uh really to rather trample
 
05:10:31.150 --> 05:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
them I mean I'm I'm looking at the
 
05:10:34.110 --> 05:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
language in here and not only are they
 
05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
setting aside or seeking to set aside
 
05:10:38.590 --> 05:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
covenants and restrictions that are
 
05:10:41.708 --> 05:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
already on property and I've heard this
 
05:10:44.230 --> 05:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
discussion already and commentary from
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
several people that um no one has to
 
05:10:49.750 --> 05:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
live in these associations people make a
 
05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
voluntary decision to do so and when
 
05:10:54.750 --> 05:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
they do that they're agreeing to live by
 
05:10:56.788 --> 05:10:56.798 align:start position:0%
these restrictions but this bill would
 
05:10:59.830 --> 05:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
set those aside and it would do it in
 
05:11:02.948 --> 05:11:02.958 align:start position:0%
favor of the hobbyist regardless of the
 
05:11:05.548 --> 05:11:05.558 align:start position:0%
opinion of the rest of the community I
 
05:11:08.670 --> 05:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
also see in here language that says that
 
05:11:12.310 --> 05:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
the owner uh would not need prior
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
approval before installing some of this
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
equipment um that speaks against uh
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
associations in general because they all
 
05:11:22.270 --> 05:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for approval even
 
05:11:24.110 --> 05:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
where people have a right to install
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
something it's about the association
 
05:11:28.470 --> 05:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
knowing what's going on and knowing that
 
05:11:31.350 --> 05:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
it's being done properly I see language
 
05:11:34.230 --> 05:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
in here that says that um someone
 
05:11:36.430 --> 05:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be prohibited from using the
 
05:11:39.390 --> 05:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
common areas including the roof for the
 
05:11:43.150 --> 05:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
installation of this equipment and for
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
those who aren't particularly familiar
 
05:11:47.510 --> 05:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
with associations um when you have the
 
05:11:49.750 --> 05:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
unit um and that's under the ownership
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
of the unit owner and you have common
 
05:11:55.470 --> 05:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
areas please know that the common areas
 
05:11:58.990 --> 05:11:59.000 align:start position:0%
are not owned by a particular unit owner
 
05:12:01.788 --> 05:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
and so what what this bill is also doing
 
05:12:04.830 --> 05:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
is it's raising both constitutional and
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
property rights issues and questions
 
05:12:09.510 --> 05:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
that would be very problematic because
 
05:12:11.830 --> 05:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh to my knowledge uh there doesn't
 
05:12:14.628 --> 05:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
exist another scheme within which any of
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
us uh have the ability to install any
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
type of equipment on property that we
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
don't actually
 
05:12:23.390 --> 05:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
own um and there are going to be some
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
serious issues that could come into play
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
when people start drilling holes into
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
roofs and then the roofs start leaking
 
05:12:32.510 --> 05:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
and then you have unit owners suffering
 
05:12:34.470 --> 05:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
water damage who are other than the
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
people who put the antenna there in the
 
05:12:38.948 --> 05:12:38.958 align:start position:0%
first place um and I think these are the
 
05:12:38.958 --> 05:12:39.948 align:start position:0%
first place um and I think these are the
the

05:12:39.948 --> 05:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:42.190 --> 05:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
important questions that that sort of
 
05:12:45.070 --> 05:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
speak to why this isn't good for
 
05:12:47.270 --> 05:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
associations and I think that that that
 
05:12:51.030 --> 05:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
really is um the question that that this
 
05:12:53.750 --> 05:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill needs to look at uh or that the the
 
05:12:55.548 --> 05:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
committee needs to look at when
 
05:12:57.270 --> 05:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
reviewing this bill it's not a question
 
05:12:59.868 --> 05:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
of the value of ham radio I don't think
 
05:13:02.548 --> 05:13:02.558 align:start position:0%
any of us um would argue against it
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
being um a a valuable activity that
 
05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
people engage in that's helpful at times
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
I think the issue here is a question of
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
property rights what this bill is
 
05:13:16.830 --> 05:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with is the places where people
 
05:13:19.350 --> 05:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
would be able to conduct this activity
 
05:13:20.990 --> 05:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
and install this equipment without
 
05:13:23.070 --> 05:13:23.080 align:start position:0%
restriction and unfortunately when it
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
comes to associations that already have
 
05:13:28.910 --> 05:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions on record um it seems
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
inappropriate for the legislature to
 
05:13:34.830 --> 05:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
step in um to to try to set that aside
 
05:13:36.548 --> 05:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
uh towards the end of this bill we see
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
language this gets back to my point
 
05:13:40.230 --> 05:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
about where really a trampling of the
 
05:13:42.270 --> 05:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
rights of the association towards the
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
end of the bill uh we see
 
05:13:47.628 --> 05:13:47.638 align:start position:0%
language about what the fines will be
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
I've never seen requirements of of what
 
05:13:52.070 --> 05:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
Association fines would be for
 
05:13:54.030 --> 05:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
violations of anything other than in
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
their own documents um so really
 
05:14:00.548 --> 05:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
problematic stuff here also um if
 
05:14:01.868 --> 05:14:01.878 align:start position:0%
there's a place where the committee
 
05:14:03.990 --> 05:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
would like me to send it I'm happy to
 
05:14:06.990 --> 05:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
send two documents that I've obtained uh
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
from Ci's National organizational Branch
 
05:14:13.548 --> 05:14:13.558 align:start position:0%
they were involved um with a proceeding
 
05:14:15.708 --> 05:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
that dealt with this issue before the
 
05:14:18.470 --> 05:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
FCC and the documents that I've looked
 
05:14:19.948 --> 05:14:19.958 align:start position:0%
at from them
 
05:14:22.750 --> 05:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
indicate that this bill has been
 
05:14:26.110 --> 05:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
proposed on a federal level and it's
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
been proposed and rejected multiple
 
05:14:32.150 --> 05:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
times and that this bill as as sort of
 
05:14:34.190 --> 05:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
another strategic Avenue has been
 
05:14:37.310 --> 05:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
proposed to the FCC with the idea being
 
05:14:40.190 --> 05:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
that the FCC would make a rule that
 
05:14:42.350 --> 05:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
would preempt the covenants and
 
05:14:45.230 --> 05:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
restrictions on Association property and
 
05:14:49.070 --> 05:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
multiple times that has also failed and
 
05:14:51.430 --> 05:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
so what you are being asked to do with
 
05:14:54.150 --> 05:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
this bill is as the New Hampshire state
 
05:14:57.670 --> 05:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to make a mistake commit an
 
05:14:59.868 --> 05:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
error that nobody else has been willing
 
05:15:02.190 --> 05:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
to do not the federal legislature and
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
and not the FCC and so I think it's
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
really kind of a big ask for you and a
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
bit of an unfair ask as well
 
05:15:11.788 --> 05:15:11.798 align:start position:0%
um and like I say I'm happy to send this
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
information so so kri what you what you
 
05:15:17.390 --> 05:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
do is um if go on to the the state web
 
05:15:19.230 --> 05:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
or web page the house represented web
 
05:15:22.030 --> 05:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
page and uh sign yourself up and in
 
05:15:23.788 --> 05:15:23.798 align:start position:0%

05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%

05:15:31.548 --> 05:15:31.558 align:start position:0%

05:15:35.470 --> 05:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
you and then I have Dean Lennon who also
 
05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
in the same position so I'm going to
 
05:15:40.910 --> 05:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
click on you to allow to talk Dean but
 
05:15:43.390 --> 05:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to upgrade you
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
because did you thank you repes

05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
we can thank you excellent I appreciate
 
05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh speak I am uh also
 
05:15:54.548 --> 05:15:54.558 align:start position:0%
an attorney uh at the same firm as Gary
 
05:15:57.150 --> 05:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
we are law partners and I'm also on the
 
05:15:59.190 --> 05:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislative AC action
 
05:16:03.070 --> 05:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh uh as part of Cai New
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
England uh I don't want to reiterate any
 
05:16:07.070 --> 05:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
of the points Gary made although I
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
certainly uh support everything he said
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
said um I think the way to look at this
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
is that when someone moves into a
 
05:16:16.230 --> 05:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
Community Association they have certain
 
05:16:19.190 --> 05:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
expectations they know there's a
 
05:16:21.470 --> 05:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines for
 
05:16:24.390 --> 05:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh the appearance of property for uh
 
05:16:25.990 --> 05:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations that they must
 
05:16:28.868 --> 05:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
abide by and what this bill seeks to do
 
05:16:32.110 --> 05:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
is to undo all of that and give certain
 
05:16:34.590 --> 05:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
uh people who engage in a certain hobby
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
rights that Trump all the rights under
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
the governing documents
 
05:16:42.150 --> 05:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
owners are given the right to use common
 
05:16:44.830 --> 05:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
area for their own purpose whether or
 
05:16:48.548 --> 05:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
not the board agrees with that and and
 
05:16:50.390 --> 05:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
gives gives that owner rights that are
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
superior to other owners uh at the
 
05:16:55.350 --> 05:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
condominium it it sort of flips
 
05:16:58.030 --> 05:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
condominium living uh on its head if you
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
will because instead of the board being
 
05:17:02.830 --> 05:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
in control it's it's a single unit
 
05:17:04.910 --> 05:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
owner I think there are serious
 
05:17:07.230 --> 05:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues with the bill uh I
 
05:17:09.030 --> 05:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
think there's property taking issues
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
when you're allowing an owner to acquire
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
common area for his or her own use and I
 
05:17:16.830 --> 05:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
think you are vitiating uh the condo
 
05:17:19.230 --> 05:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
docs as a private contract
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
you're you're changing the terms of
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
these pre-existing uh private contracts
 
05:17:27.670 --> 05:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
between um unit owners at the
 
05:17:31.350 --> 05:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
condominium um for example uh under the
 
05:17:35.150 --> 05:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh proposed statute um an antenna up to
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
33 feet high can be installed without
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
prior approv approval uh I think that
 
05:17:43.590 --> 05:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be upsetting to the the great many
 
05:17:46.510 --> 05:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
the great majority of of most any condo
 
05:17:49.110 --> 05:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh Community if suddenly an owner
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
installed that without uh prior
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
approval the uh statute also says that
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
if um an owner installs an antenna on
 
05:18:02.590 --> 05:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
limited common area the board um would
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
have mere uh easement rights to fix
 
05:18:09.708 --> 05:18:09.718 align:start position:0%
limited common area uh if it had to done
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
so instead of the condo association
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
owning The Limited common area as common
 
05:18:17.030 --> 05:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
as because it is common area all of a
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
sudden they only have easement rights
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
because this limited common area has
 
05:18:25.070 --> 05:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
been used uh to house an antenna so I
 
05:18:28.270 --> 05:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
think um it really does trample the
 
05:18:30.270 --> 05:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
rights of condo associations and and
 
05:18:32.750 --> 05:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
upends all the con all the expectations
 
05:18:35.470 --> 05:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
one has about living in a Community
 
05:18:37.430 --> 05:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
Association and for all those reasons
 
05:18:39.310 --> 05:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
and the reasons stated by Gary
 
05:18:42.750 --> 05:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
I vigorously uh oppose this
 
05:18:47.190 --> 05:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
bill okay so uh and and simar uh please
 
05:18:51.510 --> 05:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh go online U and uh and log in and
 
05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
register and also uh you know if if you
 
05:18:57.070 --> 05:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
can put your testimony in in informed
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
that would be great to have that on file
 
05:19:01.230 --> 05:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
for us I would be happy to thank you
 
05:19:05.548 --> 05:19:05.558 align:start position:0%
very much okay now I see no more
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
hands and so uh we are definitely pass
 
05:19:12.150 --> 05:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
our time um I would um I would would
 
05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
read the blue list but um I was um it
 
05:19:19.350 --> 05:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
blew up my my uh my printer so there's
 
05:19:22.310 --> 05:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
um probably a hundred names on here not
 
05:19:23.990 --> 05:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
that I knew any of the names but I
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
assume that these people were probably
 
05:19:28.430 --> 05:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
all ham radio operators but maybe not I
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%

05:19:42.948 --> 05:19:42.958 align:start position:0%
support of the bill so with that I will

foreclosed property uh it's a simple
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
bill which requires the pool cover be
 
05:21:25.990 --> 05:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
placed over a pool of a foreclosed
 
05:21:28.830 --> 05:21:28.840 align:start position:0%

more this this is a uh a bill that was
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
filed last
 
05:21:38.270 --> 05:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
year uh the bill came out of committee
 
05:21:41.708 --> 05:21:41.718 align:start position:0%
Comm with overwhelming support and it it
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
was passed on the floor on a Voice vote
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
with no debate on the
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill then when it went over to the
 
05:21:53.470 --> 05:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
Senate it uh it was not heard and it
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
there was no hearing and it was tabled
 
05:21:57.430 --> 05:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
along with hundreds of other bills that
 
05:22:00.150 --> 05:22:00.160 align:start position:0%

05:22:26.990 --> 05:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
here uh and U he actually helped me
 
05:22:29.310 --> 05:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
amend the bill a little bit uh the last
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
line of the bill
 
05:22:34.628 --> 05:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
says uh this requirement shall not apply
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
to any surface waters on the property
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to water
 
05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
courses lakes ponds marshes or titled
 
05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
Waters he just wanted that assurance and
 
05:22:47.030 --> 05:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association supported the
 
05:22:51.070 --> 05:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
bill then um I filed this bill at the
 
05:22:54.990 --> 05:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
request of Luke picket my my constituent
 
05:22:56.590 --> 05:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
from stratum who was a real in a real
 
05:22:56.600 --> 05:22:58.230 align:start position:0%
from stratum who was a real in a real
estate

05:22:58.230 --> 05:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
estate
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
business uh Mr picket should be on the
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
list yes to speak okay great and I I
 
05:23:07.948 --> 05:23:07.958 align:start position:0%
suggest Mr uh Mr chair that you hear
 
05:23:09.470 --> 05:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
from him next
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
and to spare you all me an Ask answering
 
05:23:13.788 --> 05:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
questions that he would probably do a
 
05:23:16.230 --> 05:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
better job of answering and catch up on
 
05:23:18.430 --> 05:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
time unless unless Mr chair you have a
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
pressing question of me uh I I'm I'm
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
also in Ways and Means at the moment on
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
Zoom right if you want a question or two
 
05:23:29.628 --> 05:23:29.638 align:start position:0%
of me I'll I'll take it but it'll be
 
05:23:31.628 --> 05:23:31.638 align:start position:0%
redundant of what Mr picket would say
 
05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
but okay it's up to you yeah just to
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
make sure I remember this this bill did
 
05:23:38.070 --> 05:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
not come to Commerce it went to it must
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
have gone to another I think it went to
 
05:23:42.830 --> 05:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Judiciary is my understanding
 
05:23:44.150 --> 05:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative burough is from that
 
05:23:45.708 --> 05:23:45.718 align:start position:0%
committee so she probably remembers the
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
issue okay so all right well thank you
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
very much and go back I guess the only
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say is that U for for uh
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
properties that were um uh mortgage fed
 
05:24:00.390 --> 05:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
and Fanny requires this uh this type of
 
05:24:02.590 --> 05:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
requirement you'll hear that from uh
 
05:24:06.670 --> 05:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
from uh Mr Mr picket great okay all
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
right thank you thank you all right so
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh Mr picket you have been promoted to a
 
05:24:13.110 --> 05:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
panelist so all you have to do is unmute
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
and there you done that so good
 
05:24:18.150 --> 05:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon can you hear me
 
05:24:19.948 --> 05:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
okay yes we
 
05:24:22.590 --> 05:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
can uh thank you for uh letting me
 
05:24:24.868 --> 05:24:24.878 align:start position:0%
attend uh as
 
05:24:28.708 --> 05:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh uh Pat said we uh we came before I
 
05:24:30.548 --> 05:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
guess it was the J Judiciary Committee
 
05:24:34.030 --> 05:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
not sure why it was but uh uh last year
 
05:24:37.788 --> 05:24:37.798 align:start position:0%
and uh presented this uh in essence uh
 
05:24:40.430 --> 05:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's a uh it's an attempt to eliminate
 
05:24:43.548 --> 05:24:43.558 align:start position:0%
uh an attractive nuisance uh in uh
 
05:24:48.310 --> 05:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and communities where a um
 
05:24:53.110 --> 05:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
an unattended uh unoccupied home has a a
 
05:24:59.628 --> 05:24:59.638 align:start position:0%
pool uh out out back uh that uh as uh I
 
05:25:02.030 --> 05:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
think anybody can imagine uh unattended
 
05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
or un unoccupied uh residents tend to uh
 
05:25:09.150 --> 05:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
be attractive to uh um kids
 
05:25:13.750 --> 05:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
and uh uh uncovered pools um uh either
 
05:25:17.350 --> 05:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
uncovered or un netted pools uh can be
 
05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
um can be extremely dangerous especially
 
05:25:21.948 --> 05:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
at night
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
um uh as Pat said the uh this is uh
 
05:25:28.350 --> 05:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
required by certain lenders uh we
 
05:25:30.310 --> 05:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
approached the bankers Association last
 
05:25:33.190 --> 05:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
year uh and they uh they fully supported
 
05:25:34.948 --> 05:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
it I was very pleased with that I have
 
05:25:37.230 --> 05:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
both a bank background and uh am
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
currently a real estate
 
05:25:40.708 --> 05:25:40.718 align:start position:0%
uh real estate agent primarily on the
 
05:25:43.628 --> 05:25:43.638 align:start position:0%
commercial side uh but understand this
 
05:25:45.190 --> 05:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh being being an issue on the
 
05:25:48.590 --> 05:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
residential side as well so um again it
 
05:25:51.670 --> 05:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
is a a a a practical
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
simple um attempt uh for lenders uh to
 
05:25:59.070 --> 05:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
protect communities and neighborhoods
 
05:26:02.110 --> 05:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
from um an unnecessary uh attractive
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
nuisance uh for um for
 
05:26:07.868 --> 05:26:07.878 align:start position:0%
kids great thank you uh is there any
 
05:26:12.190 --> 05:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:16.990 --> 05:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
question uh I guess not I guess it's
 
05:26:17.000 --> 05:26:18.230 align:start position:0%
question uh I guess not I guess it's
straightforward

05:26:18.230 --> 05:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
05:26:21.628 --> 05:26:21.638 align:start position:0%
enough um anybody in the committee room
 
05:26:23.788 --> 05:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
I forgot to ask
 
05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
them not that I can see you but it's all
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
right all right well thank you very much
 
05:26:32.910 --> 05:26:32.920 align:start position:0%

Association and and at this current time
 
05:26:58.750 --> 05:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
we have no position on this bill um but
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
I do have four questions if we could get
 
05:27:04.510 --> 05:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
some answers to that would help us um
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
come to a position on on this bill um we
 
05:27:10.030 --> 05:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
weren't familiar with in legislation
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
last year um but it did come up on our
 
05:27:16.350 --> 05:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
list to to watch this year um if you're
 
05:27:17.750 --> 05:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with the Hampshire building
 
05:27:19.670 --> 05:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
officials Association we are primarily
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
An Education Association professional
 
05:27:24.628 --> 05:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
association for code officials building
 
05:27:27.470 --> 05:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
fire license design professionals and
 
05:27:30.628 --> 05:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
contractors and educating them on code
 
05:27:32.750 --> 05:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
building and fire code and zoning
 
05:27:35.270 --> 05:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
ordinances in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:27:38.310 --> 05:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
um the four questions if I may uh Mr
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
chairman are first off um we're
 
05:27:43.510 --> 05:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
concerned and we don't understand what
 
05:27:46.470 --> 05:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the pool covers are and
 
05:27:49.948 --> 05:27:49.958 align:start position:0%
uh what issue are we trying to
 
05:27:52.030 --> 05:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
correct um would you like me to do all
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
four questions now uh sure why don't you
 
05:27:57.350 --> 05:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
do the four questions set the problem is
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
is you're posing them to us and just
 
05:28:01.230 --> 05:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
you're you know theoretically they would
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
we would be asking the sponsor to do
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
this so so Luke I know you're still
 
05:28:08.350 --> 05:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
there um and muted which is appre appi
 
05:28:11.150 --> 05:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
it so uh what I would ask is is that you
 
05:28:13.230 --> 05:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
posed your for question and then we can
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
have Luke come back and and respond to
 
05:28:19.430 --> 05:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much Mr chairman um
 
05:28:21.430 --> 05:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
our second question is um who is
 
05:28:24.110 --> 05:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
expected to enforce the pool cover
 
05:28:26.390 --> 05:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
requirement that's a big concern from
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
the code officials in the State uh third
 
05:28:31.470 --> 05:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
question is who is responsible for
 
05:28:34.270 --> 05:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
tracking of the foreclosures and making
 
05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
sure that the pool covers are installed
 
05:28:41.350 --> 05:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
and our fourth question is there's
 
05:28:43.868 --> 05:28:43.878 align:start position:0%
already requirements for pool
 
05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
protection um requiring guards and
 
05:28:50.590 --> 05:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
barriers for pools um already in place
 
05:28:51.990 --> 05:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
155a and specifically the international
 
05:28:56.948 --> 05:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
school and uh
 
05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
International Spa and Pool code um
 
05:29:00.400 --> 05:29:01.788 align:start position:0%
International Spa and Pool code um
section

05:29:01.788 --> 05:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:29:04.350 --> 05:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
305 um and we're just concerned we just
 
05:29:06.030 --> 05:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're not having
 
05:29:07.510 --> 05:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
conflicts between something that's
 
05:29:10.788 --> 05:29:10.798 align:start position:0%
already in legislation now um and what's
 
05:29:12.310 --> 05:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
proposed in this
 
05:29:15.070 --> 05:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
legislation so I would actually guess
 
05:29:17.270 --> 05:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the that that fourth question
 
05:29:18.868 --> 05:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
really goes back to your first question
 
05:29:20.548 --> 05:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
is where's the problem what's exactly
 
05:29:22.230 --> 05:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
the problem trying to solve if we
 
05:29:25.510 --> 05:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
already have a um zoning or not zoning
 
05:29:28.350 --> 05:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
it's a building code requirement that
 
05:29:30.270 --> 05:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
all swimming pools have to have a fence
 
05:29:33.830 --> 05:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
around them anyways correct yes sir
 
05:29:37.830 --> 05:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
perfect okay um Mr picket uh would you
 
05:29:41.430 --> 05:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
like to respond to those questions yes
 
05:29:45.310 --> 05:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh so I guess
 
05:29:48.390 --> 05:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
um uh first and four are are are
 
05:29:50.590 --> 05:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat related uh the purpose of the
 
05:29:52.910 --> 05:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
pool cover is to actually pool cover or
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
pool net is to actually cover the pool
 
05:29:58.788 --> 05:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
itself um uh
 
05:30:01.990 --> 05:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
fences uh are uh are typically not
 
05:30:04.470 --> 05:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
barriers to entry especially when a home
 
05:30:08.990 --> 05:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
is unattended uh or or or unoccupied um
 
05:30:10.868 --> 05:30:10.878 align:start position:0%
when I was a teenager we used to refer
 
05:30:12.670 --> 05:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
to it as pool hopping and it was really
 
05:30:16.150 --> 05:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
fence hopping um all fences have have
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
always been in place and uh they're not
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
they're not new uh but we uh they were
 
05:30:24.430 --> 05:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh they are not a significant
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
significant barrier to uh problems the
 
05:30:29.910 --> 05:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of the pool cover or pool net is
 
05:30:32.230 --> 05:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
to actually secure the surface of the
 
05:30:35.310 --> 05:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
pool itself whether it be full or empty
 
05:30:36.990 --> 05:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh even an empty pool is dangerous
 
05:30:38.830 --> 05:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
because people can fall follow in fall
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
in hit their head uh and with just a
 
05:30:44.110 --> 05:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
little bit of uh uh water at the bottom
 
05:30:46.110 --> 05:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
could also be an issue so it's actually
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
to secure I hate to say this to you but
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
you really need to keep straight because
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
every time you turn sideways we lose you
 
05:30:55.750 --> 05:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry so your microphone is very
 
05:30:58.150 --> 05:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
centered on you
 
05:30:58.160 --> 05:31:00.510 align:start position:0%
centered on you
okay

05:31:00.510 --> 05:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:03.708 --> 05:31:03.718 align:start position:0%
um uh who is expected to enforce it I
 
05:31:07.750 --> 05:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
would uh uh not really uh thought about
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
that but it would be to me it would be
 
05:31:13.030 --> 05:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
logical to have uh that enforcement be
 
05:31:16.590 --> 05:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
local just as uh while an occupied home
 
05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
is required to have a uh a fence uh
 
05:31:22.990 --> 05:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
whoever would uh
 
05:31:26.830 --> 05:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
would recognize or observe locally
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
whether a pool has a um has a fence on
 
05:31:33.868 --> 05:31:33.878 align:start position:0%
it would also be uh would also be the uh
 
05:31:36.750 --> 05:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
the individual or group responsible for
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
identifying whether a uh foreclosed home
 
05:31:45.190 --> 05:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
is um uh is uh has a pool cover or pool
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
net on it and then in terms of tracking
 
05:31:51.390 --> 05:31:51.400 align:start position:0%
I believe when a home is foreclosed upon
 
05:31:54.230 --> 05:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh title changes and uh the taxing
 
05:31:58.070 --> 05:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
Authority is uh is noticed when when
 
05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
that title occur uh change occurs and
 
05:32:02.590 --> 05:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
therefore the local municipality and I
 
05:32:05.190 --> 05:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
would imagine the local enforcement uh
 
05:32:08.430 --> 05:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
are housed in the same same building so
 
05:32:10.628 --> 05:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh I think that change of ownership
 
05:32:12.670 --> 05:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
would uh would be triggered locally or
 
05:32:15.510 --> 05:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be identified locally as well
 
05:32:17.230 --> 05:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
which which sounds like the code
 
05:32:19.270 --> 05:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement the town's code enforcer
 
05:32:21.390 --> 05:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
should that would be my logic that's
 
05:32:23.270 --> 05:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
where I would see it as as logically
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
Landing yes sir okay great um okay uh
 
05:32:29.470 --> 05:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
now I know this is a little awkward
 
05:32:32.910 --> 05:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
because I had um somebody else asking
 
05:32:36.350 --> 05:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
the question so uh so
 
05:32:40.708 --> 05:32:40.718 align:start position:0%
um terms of the the our code enforc did
 
05:32:43.830 --> 05:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
did you have any other questions to be
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
asked or is every
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
Everybody you okay with that or did he
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
take him oh you know what I I might have
 
05:32:53.150 --> 05:32:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:56.190 --> 05:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
out I'm sorry pop your hand back up if
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
you would like if you have any more
 
05:32:59.070 --> 05:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
questions otherwise we'll
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
assume uh uh we're all set okay all
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
right so we have I'm I guess we're all
 
05:33:10.830 --> 05:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
set um and and uh so so
 
05:33:13.310 --> 05:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh do I have anybody else so thank

jenan here we go there we go thank you
 
05:35:21.270 --> 05:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm for the record I'm
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative John janigian Rockingham
 
05:35:27.708 --> 05:35:27.718 align:start position:0%
District 8 Saleem New Hampshire um um
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
today I want to introduce uh HB 473
 
05:35:33.230 --> 05:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
which establishes a renters insurance
 
05:35:33.240 --> 05:35:35.150 align:start position:0%
which establishes a renters insurance
notification

05:35:35.150 --> 05:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
notification
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
requirements um with this bill I
 
05:35:39.430 --> 05:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
introduced the last time in a different
 
05:35:41.628 --> 05:35:41.638 align:start position:0%
bill number made a couple of changes
 
05:35:43.510 --> 05:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
I'll explain the reason for it and then
 
05:35:46.190 --> 05:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what the minor changes are
 
05:35:49.350 --> 05:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
that might make it more palatable uh
 
05:35:51.708 --> 05:35:51.718 align:start position:0%
this bill basically requires a landlord
 
05:35:54.270 --> 05:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
of a residential rental property that is
 
05:35:56.190 --> 05:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
rented for a duration of longer than one
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
month to include within the rental
 
05:36:01.670 --> 05:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
agreement just a simple sentence or two
 
05:36:03.190 --> 05:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
that informs the tenant that the
 
05:36:06.270 --> 05:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
landlord's insurance does not cover
 
05:36:07.548 --> 05:36:07.558 align:start position:0%
that's the landlord's property insurance
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
insurance does not cover the tenant's
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
belongings from loss or damage and that
 
05:36:14.110 --> 05:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
the landlord recommends the tenant they
 
05:36:16.150 --> 05:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to but the tenant purchase
 
05:36:19.310 --> 05:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
their own insurance at their own cost
 
05:36:21.310 --> 05:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
what is the point to this bill well the
 
05:36:23.868 --> 05:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
major the major point to it is and I've
 
05:36:25.510 --> 05:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
been a landlord by the way for over 30
 
05:36:27.910 --> 05:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
years I've noticed that probably at
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
least half the tenants coming in have no
 
05:36:32.190 --> 05:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
idea about renters insurance they just
 
05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
figure well something happens the
 
05:36:35.390 --> 05:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
landlords I don't know if they even
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
think about it and it's typically
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
younger tenants that would fall into
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
this category maybe firsttime tenants
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
and younger
 
05:36:43.830 --> 05:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
tenants uh but there's many instances
 
05:36:46.270 --> 05:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
where tenants property has been damaged
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
and they lose everything and there's no
 
05:36:50.670 --> 05:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
way they can recover it if they don't
 
05:36:53.708 --> 05:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
have insurance and sometimes it can end
 
05:36:55.830 --> 05:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
up in landlord tenant disputes where the
 
05:36:58.270 --> 05:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
tenant is mad or upset that why didn't
 
05:36:59.868 --> 05:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
the landlord tell them or why isn't it
 
05:37:02.270 --> 05:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
covered or or whatever so this tries to
 
05:37:04.628 --> 05:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
help set that expectation and and to
 
05:37:08.628 --> 05:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
minimize the issues in that Realm
 
05:37:12.708 --> 05:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
um and I and I'm there's also I mean I I
 
05:37:15.070 --> 05:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
can't see the list but U there's a
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
there's at least one other person um
 
05:37:20.750 --> 05:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
Diane pette who will be talking I
 
05:37:23.788 --> 05:37:23.798 align:start position:0%
believe um from Salem and she's she's
 
05:37:26.990 --> 05:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
helped um several fire uh we had a
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
couple major fires in Salem where many
 
05:37:32.470 --> 05:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
tenants lost their their belongings and
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
none of them had insurance so it's it's
 
05:37:37.270 --> 05:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
it is something that would really help
 
05:37:39.510 --> 05:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
it a lot of landlords probably already
 
05:37:41.830 --> 05:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
have a sentence like this in but many
 
05:37:44.030 --> 05:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
landlords still do not and one of the
 
05:37:45.868 --> 05:37:45.878 align:start position:0%
things that makes this simpler than last
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
time is there was there was two concerns
 
05:37:51.110 --> 05:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
that I remember last time one was
 
05:37:54.310 --> 05:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
landlords were worried that they'd have
 
05:37:56.948 --> 05:37:56.958 align:start position:0%
to go back and fix all the previous
 
05:38:00.470 --> 05:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
rental agreements so this HB 473
 
05:38:04.350 --> 05:38:04.360 align:start position:0%
explicitly says it's only only required
 
05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
for new rental agreements going forward
 
05:38:09.708 --> 05:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
and written rental agreements because I
 
05:38:11.270 --> 05:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
also had some people who are worried
 
05:38:13.548 --> 05:38:13.558 align:start position:0%
well what if you have tenant situations
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
where there's oral agreements maybe
 
05:38:16.868 --> 05:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
someone's renting a room in a house and
 
05:38:18.830 --> 05:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
things like this so we take all that off
 
05:38:21.390 --> 05:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
the table too and tried to simplify this
 
05:38:24.510 --> 05:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
to the point where hopefully it's pable
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
and um you know obviously if there's any
 
05:38:28.750 --> 05:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
other changes I'm open to other changes
 
05:38:31.868 --> 05:38:31.878 align:start position:0%
as well but with that I'll I'll stop uh
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
talking and and if anyone has any
 
05:38:35.868 --> 05:38:35.878 align:start position:0%
questions for me I'll try to answer them
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
to the best of my knowledge hey right uh
 
05:38:41.430 --> 05:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
hton thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:38:45.948 --> 05:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
representative um I remember some
 
05:38:48.910 --> 05:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
heart-wrenching testimony last session
 
05:38:51.628 --> 05:38:51.638 align:start position:0%
by people who lost everything uh and and
 
05:38:53.390 --> 05:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
we all know that people can can lose
 
05:38:54.830 --> 05:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
more than everything they can lose life
 
05:38:56.948 --> 05:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
as well so this is an important issue
 
05:38:59.590 --> 05:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
and I am a former by the way Mr chairman
 
05:39:01.590 --> 05:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
I am a former land baroness I am no
 
05:39:04.548 --> 05:39:04.558 align:start position:0%
longer in the land bearness category um
 
05:39:06.750 --> 05:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
so I I do have a kind of an on the
 
05:39:08.310 --> 05:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
ground running
 
05:39:10.070 --> 05:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
sense of what it's like for new young
 
05:39:12.910 --> 05:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
people to to rent and not be aware of
 
05:39:15.750 --> 05:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
everything my concern is that this is a
 
05:39:18.628 --> 05:39:18.638 align:start position:0%
sentence that informs them my question
 
05:39:20.390 --> 05:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
therefore is isn't this more of an
 
05:39:27.628 --> 05:39:27.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
issue um it's it's potentially a
 
05:39:34.110 --> 05:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
education issue but it's this is
 
05:39:36.070 --> 05:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
actually the third time this bill's been
 
05:39:38.548 --> 05:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
being brought up and it doesn't seem
 
05:39:41.070 --> 05:39:41.080 align:start position:0%
like the education piece is getting out
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
there um so it's that's why I felt the
 
05:39:49.110 --> 05:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
need to bring it up in a in a bill
 
05:39:51.990 --> 05:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
again thank you well set okay
 
05:39:52.000 --> 05:39:53.990 align:start position:0%
again thank you well set okay
representative

05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:39:56.670 --> 05:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
gson now thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr janigan um I I guess what I'm
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
want to make sure is is all that is you
 
05:40:05.310 --> 05:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
are seeking in this legislation is a
 
05:40:07.628 --> 05:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
statement in the lease agreement that
 
05:40:12.430 --> 05:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
the the uh the the Les e would just
 
05:40:15.310 --> 05:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledge uh some something similar to
 
05:40:16.910 --> 05:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
no pets on the property and if you have
 
05:40:18.750 --> 05:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
a pet in violation you're acknowledging
 
05:40:20.030 --> 05:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have a pet or no
 
05:40:21.830 --> 05:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
smoking on the premises acknowledging
 
05:40:23.750 --> 05:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
that and then the next line item might
 
05:40:27.110 --> 05:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
be uh my homeowner's policy does not
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
cover your personal possession so I
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
recommend if you want coverage you would
 
05:40:33.628 --> 05:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
get your own insurance policy is that it
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
and there's no cost no no cost to the to
 
05:40:38.948 --> 05:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
the to the landlord no cost to the
 
05:40:42.190 --> 05:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
tenant um well well no well there's no
 
05:40:43.990 --> 05:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
cost to the landlord of course there's a
 
05:40:45.868 --> 05:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
cost to the tenant if they want to get
 
05:40:49.030 --> 05:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
rent oh there's no cost cost no cost
 
05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
this legislation does not impose a cost
 
05:40:54.030 --> 05:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
on either the tenant or the landlord
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
just to at least say do you understand
 
05:41:00.310 --> 05:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
boom exactly yes
 
05:41:05.230 --> 05:41:05.240 align:start position:0%
yeah okay uh representative Barrow thank
 
05:41:07.030 --> 05:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for taking my question
 
05:41:09.910 --> 05:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand I give you
 
05:41:11.948 --> 05:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
a scenario to see if this bill would
 
05:41:14.510 --> 05:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
impact it let's say that somebody's
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
belongings were um there was a flood and
 
05:41:20.390 --> 05:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
the person's belongings were you know
 
05:41:22.590 --> 05:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
totally destroyed because of the flood
 
05:41:25.788 --> 05:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
but the flood was the result of of a
 
05:41:28.670 --> 05:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
negligence on the part of the landlord
 
05:41:31.948 --> 05:41:31.958 align:start position:0%
does this bill impact that them being
 
05:41:35.270 --> 05:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for that property in any
 
05:41:38.910 --> 05:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
way who uh well not being a lawyer that
 
05:41:40.708 --> 05:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
that that'd be a tough one for me to
 
05:41:43.390 --> 05:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
answer however um you know I'm trying to
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
imagine that scenario because I am a
 
05:41:48.948 --> 05:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
landlord um I mean I
 
05:41:51.430 --> 05:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
think negligence is one of those things
 
05:41:53.190 --> 05:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
where negligence doesn't protect you
 
05:41:56.030 --> 05:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
from anything so uh if I'm a negligent
 
05:41:58.628 --> 05:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
landlord not cleaning snow and ice away
 
05:42:01.468 --> 05:42:01.478 align:start position:0%
and somebody slips and Falls
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
um then and and and I and this tenant
 
05:42:07.230 --> 05:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
didn't explicitly say they were
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for the ice and snow then I
 
05:42:11.628 --> 05:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
could be responsible through a court
 
05:42:15.750 --> 05:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
action um so I don't see where this gets
 
05:42:17.030 --> 05:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
rid of
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
negligence um as an issue I'm not sure
 
05:42:22.270 --> 05:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
any any any law if it gets rid of
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
negligence um but I'm not a lawyer I
 
05:42:25.868 --> 05:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a lawyer in in the
 
05:42:27.788 --> 05:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
group that could answer that but I don't
 
05:42:31.590 --> 05:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think that would stop follow up
 
05:42:33.948 --> 05:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
please for the question meire yeah do
 
05:42:36.190 --> 05:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
you think then that this law might
 
05:42:38.670 --> 05:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
somehow communicate to tenants that the
 
05:42:41.230 --> 05:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
landlord was off the hook for any kind
 
05:42:41.240 --> 05:42:42.190 align:start position:0%
landlord was off the hook for any kind
of

05:42:42.190 --> 05:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility in all in these kinds of
 
05:42:47.390 --> 05:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
scenarios no I don't think so this is
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
very specific we're talking about
 
05:42:51.590 --> 05:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
renters insurance for their belongings
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's I think it I think
 
05:42:56.590 --> 05:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
it's very clear I don't think that would
 
05:43:00.190 --> 05:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:04.510 --> 05:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
you okay uh thank you uh representative
 
05:43:07.750 --> 05:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
Barlett thank you very much Mr chair um
 
05:43:09.430 --> 05:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
I had 35 years in
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
Insurance negligence is roughly
 
05:43:16.070 --> 05:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent to liability so if a landlord
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
so um how do I make this a question
 
05:43:21.830 --> 05:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe that if a landlord is
 
05:43:25.788 --> 05:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
as representative you gave for um an
 
05:43:28.670 --> 05:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
example uh was negligent in clearing off
 
05:43:31.150 --> 05:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
snow and someone's injured then their
 
05:43:33.788 --> 05:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
policy would respond to that type of an
 
05:43:37.590 --> 05:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
injury um however if there you know
 
05:43:39.110 --> 05:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
there are many other kinds of things
 
05:43:41.788 --> 05:43:41.798 align:start position:0%
that insurance covers that would never
 
05:43:45.390 --> 05:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
be covered under the property owner
 
05:43:48.230 --> 05:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
insurance so that's why this
 
05:43:50.670 --> 05:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
notification would really help renters
 
05:43:53.110 --> 05:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
because in all my years of insurance
 
05:43:55.670 --> 05:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
there are so many renters that have no
 
05:43:57.788 --> 05:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
idea that they have no coverage for
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
their belongings or their their um
 
05:44:02.628 --> 05:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
additional living expense if they were
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
actually out of the property that's all
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for bringing this spill
 
05:44:11.708 --> 05:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
again thank you okay so is that the kids
 
05:44:14.110 --> 05:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
voice was that is that behind you
 
05:44:17.350 --> 05:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
Chrissy or no here okay so that's gone
 
05:44:21.310 --> 05:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
okay great um all right I have see no
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
more oh I do have another hand here we
 
05:44:25.390 --> 05:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
go representative
 
05:44:28.110 --> 05:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
ham May
 
05:44:32.990 --> 05:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
inquire yes thank you um Mr chair um I
 
05:44:35.670 --> 05:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
am a landlord and and reading this
 
05:44:37.548 --> 05:44:37.558 align:start position:0%
wearing that hat
 
05:44:39.670 --> 05:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
it really does sound I think there needs
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
to be some clarification or added
 
05:44:45.110 --> 05:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
language because it says a tenant
 
05:44:48.150 --> 05:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
belongings from loss or damage and that
 
05:44:50.990 --> 05:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
loss or damage could be my fault or it
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
could be it could be my furnace that
 
05:44:55.190 --> 05:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
malfunctioned or it could be my roof
 
05:44:57.230 --> 05:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
that leaked that
 
05:45:00.430 --> 05:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
caused um the loss of your belongings
 
05:45:03.628 --> 05:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
and I know and have experienced that in
 
05:45:05.788 --> 05:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
the past I mean I would like this as a
 
05:45:09.468 --> 05:45:09.478 align:start position:0%
landlord but from the tenants uh
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
perspective um it could be interpreted
 
05:45:17.110 --> 05:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
by somebody that uh okay um my furnace
 
05:45:19.628 --> 05:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
went my roof leaked all your ruin all
 
05:45:22.350 --> 05:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
your belongings got ruined and I don't
 
05:45:25.628 --> 05:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
have to pay so uh would you believe I
 
05:45:29.110 --> 05:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
suggest there might be need for a a few
 
05:45:33.230 --> 05:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
more words in here to make that
 
05:45:36.270 --> 05:45:36.280 align:start position:0%
clear yeah I mean I'm I'm open to
 
05:45:38.628 --> 05:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
additional Lang anguage however some of
 
05:45:40.788 --> 05:45:40.798 align:start position:0%
the I'm I'm just thinking about what you
 
05:45:43.150 --> 05:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
just said I mean if the roof leaks or
 
05:45:44.270 --> 05:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
the the
 
05:45:48.190 --> 05:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
furnace I mean blows up uh or you know
 
05:45:51.150 --> 05:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
something in a way that damages things
 
05:45:53.430 --> 05:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
those are those are I mean unless it's
 
05:45:55.430 --> 05:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
again unless we're back to negligence
 
05:45:57.030 --> 05:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
where the landlord would be responsible
 
05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
for negligence but if these things just
 
05:46:01.628 --> 05:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
happen um that's not necessarily the
 
05:46:03.670 --> 05:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
land that's not the landlord's fault if
 
05:46:05.830 --> 05:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's I me if I've been servicing a
 
05:46:08.310 --> 05:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
furnace let's say I service any oil
 
05:46:10.830 --> 05:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
burning F furnace every year if
 
05:46:13.510 --> 05:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
something goes majorly wrong that causes
 
05:46:15.590 --> 05:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
damage I mean what else could I have
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
done with that I'm I'm calling the
 
05:46:19.110 --> 05:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
service guy every Year's he's servicing
 
05:46:22.510 --> 05:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
it however if I'm if I'm never servicing
 
05:46:24.990 --> 05:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
the furnace and and you know oil
 
05:46:26.670 --> 05:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
furnaces should be serviced somewhere in
 
05:46:28.590 --> 05:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
that I mean I do it every year but
 
05:46:30.110 --> 05:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that time frame if you just
 
05:46:32.510 --> 05:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
never do it and you're negligent and it
 
05:46:35.788 --> 05:46:35.798 align:start position:0%
blows up and causes problems that that
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
that negligence then is um a wholly
 
05:46:40.990 --> 05:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
different topic I I think you know
 
05:46:43.510 --> 05:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
specifically here um I think this does
 
05:46:45.430 --> 05:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
cover it but as I said I'm open to
 
05:46:50.110 --> 05:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:53.708 --> 05:46:53.718 align:start position:0%
language okay thank you uh
 
05:46:55.868 --> 05:46:55.878 align:start position:0%
representative van hton you have another
 
05:46:58.670 --> 05:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you um while I'm
 
05:47:01.910 --> 05:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely um sympathetic to this as a
 
05:47:03.910 --> 05:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
as both an educator and as a landlord
 
05:47:06.150 --> 05:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
who's who's rented to young people with
 
05:47:10.430 --> 05:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
their first rental possibility um I I
 
05:47:11.430 --> 05:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
just don't
 
05:47:14.830 --> 05:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
know okay if I were still a landlord
 
05:47:18.468 --> 05:47:18.478 align:start position:0%
today and I did not include this Clause
 
05:47:20.788 --> 05:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
under the legislation that you proposed
 
05:47:24.070 --> 05:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
would there be any ramifications for
 
05:47:26.590 --> 05:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
me I haven't
 
05:47:30.430 --> 05:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question I haven't um put
 
05:47:34.350 --> 05:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
any uh penalty in the bill I mean as
 
05:47:37.708 --> 05:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
it's as it's written there is no penalty
 
05:47:40.910 --> 05:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and partly because my goal isn't here
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
to penalize landlords um it's to bring
 
05:47:47.830 --> 05:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
awareness I mean once a bill like this
 
05:47:50.270 --> 05:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes granted the
 
05:47:50.280 --> 05:47:51.510 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes granted the
landlords

05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
05:47:54.510 --> 05:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
associations um are going to begin
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
putting out the word that you know make
 
05:47:58.510 --> 05:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
sure that you have this have this in
 
05:48:01.030 --> 05:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
there um but you know as the bill is
 
05:48:04.110 --> 05:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
written there is no penalty for thank
 
05:48:07.030 --> 05:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
you very much okay that's an interesting
 
05:48:09.510 --> 05:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
question right that that circles the the
 
05:48:10.948 --> 05:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
opposite they said if you don't put it
 
05:48:13.230 --> 05:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
in is that mean you're liable
 
05:48:15.548 --> 05:48:15.558 align:start position:0%
now because you didn't put it in the
 
05:48:18.628 --> 05:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
contract into the lease would that could
 
05:48:21.070 --> 05:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
someone then the tenant then sue you
 
05:48:23.670 --> 05:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
because you didn't put it in but I don't
 
05:48:26.350 --> 05:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
know again we don't we have to ask a
 
05:48:29.230 --> 05:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
lawyer people who are experts on that
 
05:48:32.070 --> 05:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
subject uh okay representative McClary
 
05:48:33.510 --> 05:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
has a
 
05:48:35.708 --> 05:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
question one of days we'll get there
 
05:48:37.270 --> 05:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
05:48:40.670 --> 05:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh J janigan I guess
 
05:48:43.350 --> 05:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
here I am getting my name not pronounced
 
05:48:45.270 --> 05:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
right and I'm doing the same thing I
 
05:48:49.110 --> 05:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
apologize uh is there not a standard uh
 
05:48:52.150 --> 05:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh tenant form in New Hampshire a
 
05:48:55.030 --> 05:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
standard form that a landlord would use
 
05:48:58.190 --> 05:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
I I see Christie saying there isn't I
 
05:49:00.150 --> 05:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
would have thought there'd be a standard
 
05:49:02.750 --> 05:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
form that that you could put this in but
 
05:49:05.948 --> 05:49:05.958 align:start position:0%
I guess I got my answer well I mean
 
05:49:07.548 --> 05:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
there's there's there's different forms
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
out there there's no yeah there's no
 
05:49:10.788 --> 05:49:10.798 align:start position:0%
absolute standard that every landlord
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
uses um but um there are forms that
 
05:49:16.750 --> 05:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
people can pull from various places and
 
05:49:19.948 --> 05:49:19.958 align:start position:0%
uh my my guess is um if a lawyer writes
 
05:49:22.670 --> 05:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
it up or or or somebody does have a
 
05:49:25.830 --> 05:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
standard form it probably has this in it
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
um but you know the landlords that
 
05:49:30.750 --> 05:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
aren't using standard forms or and
 
05:49:33.590 --> 05:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of them um you know then
 
05:49:35.590 --> 05:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
then they wouldn't the potential T
 
05:49:37.390 --> 05:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be aware
 
05:49:38.990 --> 05:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
um of
 
05:49:44.910 --> 05:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
it right okay thank you um so I have
 
05:49:49.350 --> 05:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
just promoted uh Rick blaze up to
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
panelist and so that he can testify
 
05:49:54.548 --> 05:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
thank you much very much represent jenan
 
05:49:57.350 --> 05:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again everybody um again
 
05:49:58.990 --> 05:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Rick blae was on earlier
 
05:50:00.670 --> 05:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
today I figured out the system it works
 
05:50:04.670 --> 05:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
well um basically I ran a land ORD
 
05:50:06.190 --> 05:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
Association for a couple of decades we
 
05:50:07.948 --> 05:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
had over th000 members in it throughout
 
05:50:10.030 --> 05:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire here and
 
05:50:11.590 --> 05:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
there's over tens of thousands of
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
landlords and the bill is good
 
05:50:15.310 --> 05:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
intentions I do this with every tenant
 
05:50:16.830 --> 05:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
every time I lease an
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
apartment and you're trying to legislate
 
05:50:21.708 --> 05:50:21.718 align:start position:0%
Common Sense here you know education is
 
05:50:23.868 --> 05:50:23.878 align:start position:0%
the big thing I think what you're trying
 
05:50:25.670 --> 05:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
to do janigan you're trying to do is
 
05:50:28.510 --> 05:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
educate the landlord to notify the
 
05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
tenant legislation is a dangerous and
 
05:50:33.510 --> 05:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
slippery slope here there is liability
 
05:50:36.270 --> 05:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
for the landlord should the something
 
05:50:39.708 --> 05:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
happen and that wasn't in their lease
 
05:50:41.390 --> 05:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
now the tenant can come back and say you
 
05:50:45.150 --> 05:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
never told me and now I'm in a lawsuit
 
05:50:47.230 --> 05:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
situation I'm going to settle just so I
 
05:50:48.590 --> 05:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to court which might
 
05:50:50.548 --> 05:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
cost me 10 or
 
05:50:52.990 --> 05:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
15,000 again in an affordable housing
 
05:50:54.548 --> 05:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
situation I wear also an affordable
 
05:50:56.468 --> 05:50:56.478 align:start position:0%
housing hat as a president on the board
 
05:51:00.430 --> 05:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
of the way home I just see this as a
 
05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
more of a reach we should be reaching
 
05:51:04.510 --> 05:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
out to people not legislating to them
 
05:51:06.590 --> 05:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this matter and if you
 
05:51:09.910 --> 05:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
put some type of you know damages in
 
05:51:13.910 --> 05:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
there or penalty in there now you got a
 
05:51:16.390 --> 05:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
whole War happening from affordable
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
housing everybody's going to come out
 
05:51:20.230 --> 05:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
screaming I just look at it as the the
 
05:51:22.030 --> 05:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill I see the merits
 
05:51:24.670 --> 05:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
of it but I don't think it should be a
 
05:51:27.868 --> 05:51:27.878 align:start position:0%
legislation issue I I just think we I do
 
05:51:29.708 --> 05:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
a good job I still even though I'm
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
retired from The Landlord Association I
 
05:51:34.670 --> 05:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
still hold meetings where I have 40 or
 
05:51:36.590 --> 05:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
50 landlords every other month coming
 
05:51:38.990 --> 05:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
into classes I'm doing one for neighbor
 
05:51:42.868 --> 05:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
Works in Manchester here on Saturday and
 
05:51:44.750 --> 05:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
again I just try to bring Common Sense
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
the how do you run a business as a
 
05:51:48.910 --> 05:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
landlord large or small and I think if
 
05:51:50.230 --> 05:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
anything that's where the energy should
 
05:51:52.708 --> 05:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
be put not so much in a legislation like
 
05:51:55.110 --> 05:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
this but I appreciate all you guys do
