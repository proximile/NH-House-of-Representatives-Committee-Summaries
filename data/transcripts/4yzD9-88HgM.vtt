County committee it's uh good to be back
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
here again um I was not anticipating
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill this morning but
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh seeing as the prime sponsor is not in
 
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
attendance and I am a co-sponsor I'd be
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
happy to introduce this bill to you um
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh just making a technical
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
change to language that was already
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
passed and uh put into statute uh we
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
want to support our for our farmers and
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
the work that they do and the times that
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
they need to do the work that they do so
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh we are just um proposing to strike
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
the words quiet hours in uh the current
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
language and that's pretty much um the
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
essence of this
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
legislation and so I hope that you will
 
00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639 align:start position:0%
support the technical change um and and
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
allow our Farmers to do the kinds of
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
work that they need to do at the times
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
that they need to do
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
them and with that I guess I can attempt
 
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
to take some questions although I do H I
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
do see um members here who uh uh who are
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
are also willing and able to take
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee regarding
 
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:11.629 align:start position:0%

this

00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%

there are
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
existing qu why at our ordinances are
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
they grandfathered or they do they
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
become null and void I believe they are
 
00:13:36.079 --> 00:13:38.870 align:start position:0%
become null and void I believe they are
not

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
grandfathered

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
grandfathered
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative appreciate it appreciate

committee 2025 and happy to be here um
 
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
we support the bill um we believe these
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
technical changes um we believe it does
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
add some clarity uh the coming around is
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
just some information on you know why is
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
a Timber guy here on an egg bill um in
 
00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statute
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
forestry is is considered agricultural
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
operations under
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
234a forestry or lumbering as some folks
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
used to call it way back when was
 
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
considered is is is defined as
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
agriculture um New Hampshire our our
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
forestry and our in in Forest management
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
is a is a big part of our economy um our
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
association we represent land owners but
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
we also represent loggers Foresters and
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
and wood processors
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire we're the second
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
most forested state in the nation uh 83%
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
of our state is actually covered with
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
Forest of which
 
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
76% is privately owned um unlike many
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
western states where it's actually the
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
reverse you have a lot more public
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
ownership here in the East we of course
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
have more private ownership coming
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
around is some information just
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
articulating that you don't have to take
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
my word for it this is from the US
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
Forest Service uh this is a survey data
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
they do periodic surveys of of the
 
00:16:04.199 --> 00:16:05.430 align:start position:0%
they do periodic surveys of of the
forest

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
forest
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
condition and and so you'll see that
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
this information as it comes
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
around why this is important in in kind
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
of how this dovetails with with House
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 272 is New Hampshire law in many
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
areas recognizes the importance of
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
Forestry and Forest management we have
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
current use assessment we have Timber
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
tax which is actually called the forest
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
conservation act that both deal with you
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
know the taxation of land forest land in
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
Timber um in the current use and the
 
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
preamble to that there's actually
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
language that talks about the importance
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
of of open space and and Forestry for
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
the state and even in Planning and
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
Zoning RSA 672 colon 1 it states um
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
under the Declaration of purposes the
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
the harvesting of Timber often
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
represents the only income that can be
 
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
derived from property without resorting
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
to development of the property for more
 
00:17:07.949 --> 00:17:07.959 align:start position:0%
intensive uses and pursuant to RSA 79 A1
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has declared
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
that is in the public interest to
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
declare excuse me to encourage
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
preservation of open space by conserving
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
force and other natural
 
00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
resources so again this ties into house
 
00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.189 align:start position:0%
resources so again this ties into house
bill

00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
272 in that the ability to manage and
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
harvest get some feedback here the
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
ability to manage and harvest Timber is
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
important to maintaining that Forest is
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
Forest um things like noise ordinances
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
um because we are a seasonal it is a
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
seasonal business that is subject to the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
whims of Mother Nature and weather there
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
are instances where you do have to
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
operate in on you know at times of the
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
day that may not be 9 to5 and so for
 
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:55.960 align:start position:0%
that reason things like noise ordinances
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
can really create a problem when you're
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
try particular Al in a month or two when
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
mud season's approaching us and you're
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
you're walking with a road agent saying
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
all right I need to move some Timber out
 
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
he's like you can do it but you got to
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
get you got to before you can drive on
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
those roads and before they warm up you
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
need to have your trucks out of there by
 
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
you know 6:00 a.m. again that can run
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
into direct conflict with say a quiet
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
hours or noise ordinance that says you
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
can't start operating until
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
8:00 and so we you know having spoken to
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill the intent of
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
it is to is to clarify and not make to
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
clarify that what we're talking about
 
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
here are ordinances noise ordinances not
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
just quote quiet hour ordinances but
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
noise ordinances in general um since the
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
law was passed a year or two ago there
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
have been several instances where again
 
00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
it has been exercised where you know hey
 
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
you can't you know we want to shut your
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
job down or you can't operate and we've
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
been able to exercise this to say look
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
we have some extenda circumstances here
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
we've got to get if we're going to get
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
this wood off the The Landing and take
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
advantage of cold temperatures to not
 
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
tear up the road we do need to run we've
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
been able to exercise this law so and to
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
kind of put this into context this isn't
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
you know Timber harvesting happens
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
across the state when I looked at
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
2022 report of cut this is from the
 
00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799 align:start position:0%
timber tax records there are there are
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
about 2,300 Timber sales that occur
 
00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:34.919 align:start position:0%
across the state so this is it's not
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
just an isolated situation and these
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
occur in in many many many communities
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of the communities
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the state even cities like Manchester
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
and Nashua do have occasionally they'll
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
have small forestry projects so again
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
having given you the context why we
 
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
support this we think this technical
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
change does add some clarity in does
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
does add some clarity and we would
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
support this and hope you would find
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
this ought to pass with that I'll
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
conclude my my testimony and be happy to
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
try and answer any
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr stock other
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Colby thank you
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh is there a point where
 
00:20:19.679 --> 00:20:21.029 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh is there a point where
forestry

00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
forestry
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
activities end uh and land clearing for
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
construction or development
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
begins yet there there is and actually
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
in 67 RSA
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
674 they talk the where they talk about
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
the duties of the planning board there's
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
actually a distinction that's made
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
between forestry and when a site plan
 
00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
review or a subdivision is proposed and
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the trigger is when that
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
subdiv when you apply for that
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
subdivision or you're applying for a
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
site plan review that's when you start
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
kind of of drifting into these I'll call

00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
Timber sale now file for your
 
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
subdivision and anything henceforth is
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%

questions represent
 
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
FR thank you madam
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
chair um would this bill apply or this
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
exemption apply to a specific spe ific
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
agricultural activity or forestry
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
activity on a specific wood lot or would
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
it extend to that log truck that's going
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
through town at 4 in the
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
morning the way I read the bill is it it
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
applies to the agricultural operation
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking you know this is a piece
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
of property if you have traffic on a
 
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
road whether it's a log truck or an
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
garbage truck or a fuel delivery truck I
 
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
see that as a a separate issue and what
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is really kind
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
of a land use issue as opposed
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
to what you're kind of getting
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
at that's my interpretation I'm not a
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'll preface it thank you for
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation does anybody else have a
 
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.669 align:start position:0%
interpretation does anybody else have a
question

00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr stock thank you

stated earlier we too see it as really
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
simply a a clarification of the intent
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
of legislation that was passed by the
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
you the legislature in uh two years ago
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
in 2023 through House Bill
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
252 and to give you an idea of the types
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
of things when you're talking about
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
noise ordinances that are uh that affect
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
agricultural operations would be like
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
the the application of of crop
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
protectants whether it be uh pesticides
 
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
or herbicides or even fertilizers where
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
when you're when you're applying
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
particularly a pesticide you want you
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
want no wind uh to to to to to to apply
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
as you should and and it's also in many
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
instances you you in early in the
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
morning you'll have a little bit of a do
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
so some wetness so the the the the
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
application is where you want it so that
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
that's really important and it could be
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
in the evening as well um also uh Mr
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
stalk mentioned it with with frozen
 
00:24:52.269 --> 00:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
ground and and I know I have a a small
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
uh livestock operation and you want to
 
00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:58.039 align:start position:0%
get out in your ground uh in the in the
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
spr of the year when the ground's frozen
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
you don't want to create ruts and get in
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
the mud and to do that you really you
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
when the ground tends to be Frozen when
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's darker just middle of the day it
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
warms up and you can you you want to
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
mesh your ground up so if you can get
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
out there to feed livestock or or run a
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
tractor around the farm uh if if you can
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
do that early in the morning when the
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
ground's frozen or later in the evening
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
and and that also it also applies to
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
just the harvesting of crops uh as you
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
know agriculture is weather dependent
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
and there are times as a farmer when I
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
can't do my I can't Harvest and get what
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
I need to do with with coming weather
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
and that is as Mr talk mentioned that 9
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
to5 uh time frame I I I need uh you know
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
when the when the crop is ready it needs
 
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
to come in and if it takes uh you know
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh later uh evenings into into the night
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
um as well in hot weather uh as far as
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
haying you often you need to Hay if
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
you've got some lighting on your
 
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
equipment to hay in the in the dark if
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
you go across other parts of the country
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
because of the heat I mean you'll see
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
lights on tractors and they're
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
harvesting right through the night
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's when they harvest they do not
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
Harvest during the day because of
 
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
because of the the Heat and the the
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
and just to answer a a a question
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the the transportation of of
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
the product if you look if you look at
 
00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
RSA 21 colon 34- a that that defines
 
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
agriculture of uh farm and farming and
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
statue in section two of that it it it
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
defines the words Agriculture and
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
farming it means all operations or
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
activities of a farm including and then
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
it lists them you'll see that and it
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
it's really the the husbandry of
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
livestock in the the planting growing
 
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.630 align:start position:0%
livestock in the the planting growing
harvesting

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
harvesting
 
00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:51.559 align:start position:0%
cultivating of a crop itself in one form
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
or another it would not include the you
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
know the delivery to Market or or or
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
just just the general Transportation
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
outside of the the bringing it in from
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
the field on the on the farming
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
operation okay I again I we we do
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
time I was here it was actually very low
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will help oh there
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
there's actually a volume yeah adjust I
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
didn't know that test test test test
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
test thank you anyways yeah it's on the

um thank you uh committee for listening
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
to a short testimony on this it's pretty
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
simple overall I at least I think so
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's allowing the voters you could
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
say The Best of Both Worlds you go in
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
into a delivera to session or Tom
 
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
meeting and you have your bill may be
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
petitioned or may it even be the uh
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
presented by the select board School
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
Board in any case changes are made to
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
that bill or that warrant outgo excuse
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
me so what this is going to
 
00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
allow if the changes where the amendment
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
was approved to the warrant ticle what
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
it will allow is the
 
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
original warrant out will go
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
forward to the voters and it will also
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
allow the
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
amended warant out of to go forward to
 
00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
the voters so the voters have the
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
ultimate say and I think that's what we
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
all want is is is the voters to have the
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
ultimate say and that's that's all this
 
00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:51.839 align:start position:0%
does so if someone amends the B amends
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
the warrant articles any of them then
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
both go to the voters to to decide and
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
of course the one that gets the most
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
votes wins in the case of a tie the
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
amended one would
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
win if that ever
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
happened um I'll take whatever question
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
I can and I'm hopefully there'll be some
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
others speaking as well questions for
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%

my
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
question the concern I have what do you
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
have two or three different amendments
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
on a warrant
 
00:45:34.549 --> 00:45:34.559 align:start position:0%
article thank you representative uh of
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
course on the warrant article the one
 
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
course on the warrant article the one
the

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
actual final amended warrant article is
 
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
the one that goes forward does that make
 
00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.069 align:start position:0%
the one that goes forward does that make
sense

00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:47.079 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
yes further
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative grund thank you madam
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
question so as two towns have public
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
hearings they have deliberative sessions
 
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
and then they have voting there are
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
three opportunities for voters to
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
participate in the process along with
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
budget committees and all those things
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
that review The Articles putting the
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
putting the
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
two different Warren articles on a
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
ballot in March when voters participate
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
in deliberative session do you believe
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
that could be really confusing what
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
people show up and vote on and cause
 
00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.109 align:start position:0%
people show up and vote on and cause
more

00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
confusion uh thank you for the question
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
and I hope not but putting it on the
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
ballot in March or may it be May
 
00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:43.559 align:start position:0%
whatever the date May
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
Be allows
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
those those people those voters that are
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot voters because they're
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
out of town it gives them the chance to
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
vote on either the initial warrant
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
article or the amend
 
00:46:59.950 --> 00:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
so which is which is really ultimate
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
everybody gets the vote not everybody is
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
able to show up for a delative session
 
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:06.200 align:start position:0%
or a hearing and that's what we always
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
see I mean uh in my area for a school
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
district let's say there's 7,000 voters
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 100 to 200 voters show up
 
00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:17.559 align:start position:0%
at a deliver a session but when it comes
 
00:47:20.349 --> 00:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
time to vote it's around three you know
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
around 3,000 3,000 vter is 2500 so it's
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:29.589 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.510 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
representative

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
Walker thank you madam chair I I look at
 
00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:37.790 align:start position:0%
this I just
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.030 align:start position:0%
this I just
[Music]

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
figure having both of them on there
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
could pose a great deal
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
of for people not really paying
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
attention much they see the first one
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
then they see the second one again they
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
think it's a redundant or confu a lot of
 
00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:55.559 align:start position:0%
confusion with this and plus your
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
statement a while ago you mentioned that
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
the ti vote goes to the amended one I
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
so where would you come up with that
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
question um thank you representative for
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
your question so on line six and
 
00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:25.400 align:start position:0%
seven if I'm reading this right uh it
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
says the receiving the higher percentage
 
00:48:28.559 --> 00:48:30.349 align:start position:0%
says the receiving the higher percentage
of

00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
yes will be adopted okay um at that
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
point so there that
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
will alleviate if there was a tie uh so
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
second I'm just trying to because this
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
we we did when it was submitted we did
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
change this a couple of times but I I
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
thought we had in there as for ties
 
00:49:21.789 --> 00:49:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
correctly TI would get
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
ne I apologize I don't I don't see that
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
I didn't either representative sellers
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
so if you look um down
 
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.950 align:start position:0%
so if you look um down
under

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
13 section
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
13 okay line 17
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
through through 18 that's where the
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
answer lies got it thank you thank you
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair it it does say if both
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
versions of the warrant article receive
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
the same percentage of yes then the
 
00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.829 align:start position:0%
the same percentage of yes then the
amended

00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%

00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
other part your other question because I
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
no I just was concurring with okay thank
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
you I and I apologize I uh I've been
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
extremely busy this morning to didn't
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
you have a chance to like this so I
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
would um point out just to add Clarity
 
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh you hear me say often that with
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
regards to the um text of bills before
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
us we are to f focus on The Bold
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
language however you will notice that um
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
under section three of this bill it says
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
new paragraph So if you look at the
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
front page of the bill um just as a
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
reference to to help to remind it says
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
matter which is all new will re will
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
appear in regular type so in that
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
case um that's where we also need to
 
00:50:54.839 --> 00:50:57.270 align:start position:0%
case um that's where we also need to
look

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.270 align:start position:0%
look
additional

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.349 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
representative

00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
majority thank you mad chairwoman and
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
curious how this affects default budgets
 
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
um if we go in if the budget is
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
amended by you know up to 10% of course
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's amended in any way you'll have both
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
budgets on the ballot one is going to
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
win and therefore under this bill
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
default budgets no longer exist if I'm
 
00:51:34.109 --> 00:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
reading that correctly is that would
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
would would you interpret it the same
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
way so when you amend the budget I mean
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
so you have a proposed budget and a
 
00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
default budget the only budget you're
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
amending is the
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
proposed correct that's my understanding
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
on a sb2 you you never you cannot amend
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
the default budget you have an official
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
budget that comes from the official
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
sorry I missed that I was taking notes
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
so you're good you should
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
have so in in an sb2 town our official
 
00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
budget committee will the select board
 
00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
will send a proposed budget to the
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
official budget committee which will
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
then send that official budget to the
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing um or to deliberative
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
session ultimately so we have an
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
official budget we have the default
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
budget which is set by the select
 
00:52:32.430 --> 00:52:32.440 align:start position:0%
board I I think we might be getting
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
semantics and wording uh because I know
 
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
at our sb2 town at school district we
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
have a default budget which is set in
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
stone it's last year's budget plus or
 
00:52:45.069 --> 00:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
minus onetime expenses and so on and
 
00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
contracts and then we have a proposed
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
budget which that's the one that is
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
developed by call it the select board in
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
this case it was the school board SAU or
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
and or if you have a budget committee
 
00:52:59.069 --> 00:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
the budget Committee of the school board
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
so what I'm saying is the only one when
 
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
you go to Warrant when you go to deliver
 
00:53:05.069 --> 00:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
the session the only one the voters
 
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
could actually change would be the
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
proposed budget they cannot touch that
 
00:53:15.309 --> 00:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
set yes and I appreciate the discussion
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is a healthy discussion about it
 
00:53:22.829 --> 00:53:22.839 align:start position:0%
but if we I'm still trying to figure out
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
how the default budget is even viable
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
any longer if you have one budget that
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
one budget that is then
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
amended you'll then have both of those
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
budgets on the ballot therefore one of
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
if I read this correctly and that's what
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to clarify if one of those
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
has to win even if there's a tie the
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
default budget is I'm trying to figure
 
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
out if the default budget is still in
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
play thank you representative I
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
understand and I understand it gets it's
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
gets squirly a little bit and I won't
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
disagree with you because technically
 
00:53:58.109 --> 00:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
you could say say you have that proposed
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
budget the original proposed budget now
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
you get the amended proposed budget and
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
you still have the default budget so
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
technically that's how it could actually
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
go be going to the voters that's the way
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
I see that you know because you have the
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
original the amended and then you got
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
the default I'm hoping someone else can
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
better explain that but that's how I
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
look at it and that that could be an
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
issue I won't disagree thank
 
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.069 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
kazin

00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
kazin
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question for SP2
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
Town's deliberative session would
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
this uh basically
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
remove any motions to stop
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
reconsideration of Warrant articles
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
because if it goes to the
 
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:56.920 align:start position:0%
warrant it will be reconsidered
 
00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:57.990 align:start position:0%
warrant it will be reconsidered
thank

00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for the question is
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's the reconsideration once it goes on
 
00:55:06.309 --> 00:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
the ballot for the March meeting for the
 
00:55:08.829 --> 00:55:08.839 align:start position:0%
voters there there is no reconsideration
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
at that point it would only be the
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
delivera of session or a town
 
00:55:16.589 --> 00:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
meeting at that
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
point uh would actually I would say the
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
reconsideration is is not off the table
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
it's still there at delivered a session
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
further questions the chair recognizes
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative Gerard for a
 
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative sellers for taking my
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
question I think I actually can try to
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
help with the question that uh
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative major said because if you
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
look at line
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
16 the only time it would go to it would
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
still go to a default budget it says
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
that the warrant articles are if are
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
both approved then the one with the
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
higher would actually be approved so if
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
both failed then I believe at that point
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah further
 
00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.190 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
representative

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
costs um these are unfunded mandates
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
being put on to the towns and I I don't
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
know about the ballots but I know for
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
the accessible voting machine which I
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
have the paperwork here the cost on it
 
00:56:39.870 --> 00:56:39.880 align:start position:0%
is between 600 for 1 to five
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
pages and it's I think it's 650 750 or
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
850 for the
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
um for the eight or more pages six or
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
more pages these are these are that's
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
just for the accessible voting machine
 
00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
forget about the other paper and other
 
00:56:58.829 --> 00:56:58.839 align:start position:0%
ballot they have to be printed for that
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
don't you know how do you expect the
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
towns to pay for these and when the when
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
the election budgets are already at a
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
stretch thank you uh thank you
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative and of course you being a
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
moderator which if I remember correctly
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
you know a lot more in the cost area of
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
this area um and it does say in the in
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
the the fiscal notes it says the bill
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
could result
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
so um should it have a fiscal note or
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
and further questions the chair
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Gilman thank
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
my question um I want to address uh your
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
statement about absentee ballots um
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
there is AOW written testimony at public
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
hearings I understand uh at there's
 
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
nothing for absentee voters at
 
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
deliberative session but there is a
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
result from the deliberative session so
 
00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:09.039 align:start position:0%
does this bill not uh disenfranchise the
 
00:58:09.039 --> 00:58:11.750 align:start position:0%
does this bill not uh disenfranchise the
deliberative

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
session um thank you representative I'm
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
not quite sure I'm following and I
 
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
apologize um I I get that like you said
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
you can do testimony by hearing but at
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
the deliver a session all the ones of
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
you have to be there in in order to make
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
any amendments or vote yay and nay on
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
the warrant
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
Doles Madam chair may I follow up yes
 
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um I guess my point is a vote
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
is taken at the deliberative session
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not there are absentee
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
ballots um but if the if there is an
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
amendment at the deliberative
 
00:58:52.109 --> 00:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
session and we put both of the Articles
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
the first and the amended version on the
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
ballot AR isn't the vote at the
 
00:58:59.109 --> 00:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
deliberative session of the folks that
 
00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
were at the deliber deliberative session
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
then um
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
discounted you know they they've made a
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
motion and they've changed something why
 
00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.829 align:start position:0%
motion and they've changed something why
why

00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't why doesn't their vote count
 
00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:15.559 align:start position:0%
thank you represent now I'm following
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yeah technically they
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
had their vote at the deliver session
 
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
deliver session says yeah let's amend
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
this warrant article that's the one they
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
they believe should go forward all right
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's true and you're right their the
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
their vote and what they have approved
 
00:59:34.270 --> 00:59:34.280 align:start position:0%
to deliver the session still will go
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
forward but now it's just given the the
 
00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
voters that are there or that come to
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
vote in March I'm using March as an
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
example come to vote in March or by
 
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:47.789 align:start position:0%
example come to vote in March or by
absentee

00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
ballot you could say they're getting The
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
Best of Both Worlds because they weren't
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
able to make to deliver the session
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
because they're out of town or in the
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
service or or disabled
 
00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
so therefore you know they're able to
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
vote for either one at that
 
01:00:03.789 --> 01:00:03.799 align:start position:0%
point thank
 
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes representative
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Madame chairman thank
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
you representative sers for taking my
 
01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:17.720 align:start position:0%
question um I live in a small town we
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
have a very small town hall or venue for
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
holding deliberative sessions and public
 
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:30.200 align:start position:0%
hearings would you say that most towns
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
and cities in the in the state have a
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
venue big enough to hold all the
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
voters um for deliberative
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
sessions thank you for the question and
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
I would have to say all the towns I've
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
ever been at no that's impossible like I
 
01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:49.839 align:start position:0%
said in our school district there's
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
about 7,000 voters and gym or Auditorium
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative sers thank you for your
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
Dees welcome to Municipal and County
 
01:01:24.079 --> 01:01:26.789 align:start position:0%
Dees welcome to Municipal and County
Government

01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
Government
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you to the chair in the
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee for letting me speak today my
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
name is Brody Dees I represent the New
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and um
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to House Bill uh 149 um
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
reason being is that we think it would
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
create confusion and the point of
 
01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
deliberative session it's the first
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
session of the town meeting um we
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
believe that the voters should have a
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
right to be able to amend warrant
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
articles and the warrant articles that
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
are um the ones that end up being on the
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
warrant without having to worry
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
competing waren articles um after the
 
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
voters have made a decision over what
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to be voting on um our
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
other concern is that this is rank
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
Choice voting for Warren articles um by
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
having these two different Warren
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
articles you're essentially establishing
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
a rank Choice system which would be a
 
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
lot to educate our um election officials
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
on would be a lot to educate the voters
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
on um in the residence of the of the
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts in
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
um we think that um after deliberative
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
session if the budget was for example if
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
the budget was amended all of a sudden
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
there' be two budgets what if both pass
 
01:02:37.109 --> 01:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
um there might be confusion because not
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to be able to
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
understand the law especially if it's uh
 
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
passed as written um so for those
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
reasons um we're opposed and we think
 
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
that the current system works the way
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
it's intended which is allowing the
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
voters to amend warrant articles in the
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
first session and then to vote on those
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
warrant articles in the second session
 
01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
like a traditional town meeting where
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
you would have a you would amend a warn
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
article and then you would vote but albe
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
it at One Singular session but because
 
01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
there's a vote by ballot there's a
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
requirement of a second session in sb2
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
towns with that I will answer any
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
Dees the chair recognizes representative
 
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair um how do
 
01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
you feel this would affect voter
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
engagement um if voters were to review
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
the official ballot online and see that
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
what might normally be uh eight pages uh
 
01:03:36.029 --> 01:03:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
14 um I'm I don't think it would
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
decrease voter engagement because I
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
think the voters who show up to
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
deliberative session or to SB to the um
 
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
you know in s SP town in sb2 towns to
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
the to the actual vote um by ballot um
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
they tend to be the same people I mean
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
they tend to be the folks who have
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
always gone to deliberative session who
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
care there's something that's motivating
 
01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
them to go there whether it's a budget
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
or a specific warrant article might be a
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that's helping to fund rais
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
for a specific building that's being
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
upgraded um and the people who go and
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
vote on the official warrant they tend
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
to also be the same group of people who
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
care about their taxes or other things
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
that the town is doing and they might
 
01:04:17.789 --> 01:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
not be opposed to any of the warn
 
01:04:20.029 --> 01:04:20.039 align:start position:0%
articles or at least to the language of
 
01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
them that are proposed at the
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
deliberative so um I mean we we don't
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
view this as in any any way increasing
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
or decreasing voter participation it's
 
01:04:32.589 --> 01:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
just making a system that works that's
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
supposed to mirror to the best of you
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
know supposed to mirror the traditional
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
town meeting system of government in New
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know2 is not supposed to
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
be a completely different system it's an
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
attempt to mirror but allow a vote by
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
ballot and making it a little bit more
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
convoluted and confusing to the voters
 
01:04:50.589 --> 01:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
so what what I think would happen is the
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
typical voters that are used to the
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
current system would you know either at
 
01:04:56.029 --> 01:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
deliberative be confused about the fact
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
that they've accidentally maybe created
 
01:04:59.789 --> 01:04:59.799 align:start position:0%
two warrant articles over the same item
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately the voters will go
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
to the ballot who say why are there two
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
and how does this work and then being
 
01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
confused at the end of the process about
 
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
so the chair recognizes representative
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh taking my
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
question the
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
the lost my train of thought a little
 
01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:28.109 align:start position:0%
the lost my train of thought a little
bit

01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
bit
 
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry lost my three that's okay
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy I'll I'll come
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
back to you so at this time the chair
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
repres the chair recognizes
 
01:05:38.839 --> 01:05:40.150 align:start position:0%
repres the chair recognizes
representative

01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
grunt thank you very much Madam chair
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:05:46.279 --> 01:05:47.990 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
regarding

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh language of Warrant articles there's
 
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of legal ease that is involved in
 
01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
those What would happen if there is an
 
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to a warant article that
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't have appropriate legal
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
language that's a great point and I
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
think I had that on my notes but I
 
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
forgot to mention it um that would get
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
confusing you would have a competing War
 
01:06:12.069 --> 01:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
article where one is legal or one is not
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
legal it's not worded correctly um and
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
if the governing body you know proposed
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the legislative body at
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
deliberative session to say oh this war
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
article currently isn't legal we'd like
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
to make it legal so then it is actually
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
binding after the vote um all of a
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
sudden you're going to have an illegal
 
01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
warant article competing with the legal
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
warrant article um you know and it
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
happens there are times where especially
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
with petition warn articles and where I
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
know you have a bill that's coming up
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
later today where we're discussing
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
intent what's intent and you might even
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
have a petitioner who shows up and says
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
well this was my original intent uh I
 
01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
don't want that to be my intent anymore
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
I've learned more about this after
 
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
putting this in I actually might want it
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
to do something different or it seemed
 
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
like my intent was this but I really
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
want to do this I'd like to change the
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
intent so all of a sudden you're going
 
01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
to have warant articles competing
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
against each other with varying intents
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
you're kind of taking the power away
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
from the legislative body and you're
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
undermining the whole point of the
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
deliberative session which is where the
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
public where the legislative body is
 
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
allowed to deliberate before they vote
 
01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
on the Warren articles and in2 then
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
there's a second session where it's done
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
by ballot traditional town meeting it's
 
01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
done then and there um at the town
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
meeting the chair now recognizes
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy thank you madam
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
chair you talked about education for the
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
election workers um How much would it
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
cost for nhma to hold those classes or
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
for the you can't answer for the
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office or would you
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
work with them in conjunction with the
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office to educate
 
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
all the election workers because it's
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
that's no small
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
task it definitely is no small task um
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure um what exactly nhma would
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
do in response to this bill passing
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
that's not really within my role or
 
01:07:58.470 --> 01:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
purview at our organization I can ask
 
01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
our executive director about that and
 
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
get back to your representative M Murphy
 
01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
but um I would say I mean that's uh you
 
01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
know part of the that's a I would say
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good reason why the bill should
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
be voted against because of the herculan
 
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
task to try to re-educate not just you
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
know folks who are helping to administer
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
these elections but legislative bodies
 
01:08:20.269 --> 01:08:20.279 align:start position:0%
in every municipality and School
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
District I mean this would be a
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
Monumental change to how we historically
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
have done town meeting in the state of
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
additional questions the chair
 
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative majori thank
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman and thank you for
 
01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm looking at an
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that we have for an executive
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
bill that we'll have later on today it's
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
a significant rewrite to the existing
 
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
Bill uh if the same thing would happen
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
at uh when we're at an election day and
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
you had a significant rewrite to
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
something would the voter be able to ask
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
a question of the moderator to get CL
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
electioneering I'm
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
sorry confused by the um by your
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
question only because
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
um are you are you asking are you asking
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
about this bill are you asking about
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
another bill are you just asking about
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
the general process during deliberative
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
session the general process on Election
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
Day if there are two if there are two
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
articles on the ballot one being a
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
significant rewrite of the original but
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
both being there and the voter had a
 
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
question about the difference could and
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
they it's a two-part question really
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
could they ask a question of an election
 
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
official and if they did would that
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
start to touch on electioneering if
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
you're describing the difference between
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
the two
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
articles that's a great question I would
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
have to double check whether legal
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
Council about that but I do know that
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
there are prohibitions on um how our
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
election officials are allowed to
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
discuss things that are on the warrant
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
so I do know that there are limitations
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
and um I guess you could you could you
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
could arguably infer that based on how
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
they might describe the confusing
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
situation of two competing warrant
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
articles that um you might have someone
 
01:10:20.229 --> 01:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
in the community who wouldd be upset and
 
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
try to challenge that they were
 
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
electioneering um which would further
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
kind of Muddy the process but I can look
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
more into that with our legal counsel if
 
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
to at this time the chair recognizes
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan for a question
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh in reference to
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
a question that came up earlier um when
 
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
the when the uh deliberative
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
session ends up
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
modifying a warant article and renders
 
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
modifying a warant article and renders
it

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
illegal um uh isn't it true that the
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
Govern governing body then has a
 
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.270 align:start position:0%
Govern governing body then has a
subsequent

01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
subsequent
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
challenge uh to proceed to whether or
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
not they're going to uh uphold that
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
warrant article that that if they're
 
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
faced with implementing an illegal
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
warrant article that they have a choice
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
to uh to implement or to not to
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
implement yeah so I understand um the
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
intent of your question if I think I do
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
um I mean municipalities are going to
 
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
bring in their legal council maybe
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
contact the State and try to figure out
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
so the governing bodies and try to
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
figure out how to interpret and whether
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
or not they're required if it's IL legal
 
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
if it's an illegal warrant article but I
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
think that's part of the um part of the
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
reason why we have a deliberative
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
session is so then we can deliberate and
 
01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
explain you know usually municipalities
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
or school districts will have their
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
legal council present to kind of explain
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
this is why it's illegal this is the
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
language I've recommended to the
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
governing body and the legislative body
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
and this language would now make it
 
01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
legal so then it would be binding after
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
the vote and there would be no ambiguity
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
so um that's why it's usually good
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
rather than having a competing illegal
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
and legal warn article to have one one
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
language that's legal and binding for
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
the governing body to be able to
 
01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
implement after the vote should it
 
01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
pass further
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman thank you Madam
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
question excuse me after uh Warren
 
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
article is um amended at deliberative
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
session don't the select board or other
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
SP2 body um have to re certify their
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
opinion on it as you as you know as uh
 
01:12:50.350 --> 01:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
five you know three out of five uh
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
select board members approve this
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
measure would they not have to go and do
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
that they have the original do that on
 
01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.629 align:start position:0%
that they have the original do that on
the

01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
amendment I think it would be reasonable
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
to assume that you know usually it
 
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
happens after the deliberative so they
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
you know they'll journ the deliberative
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
but usually the governing bodies will
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
open a public meeting and then open the
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
deliberative they'll close the
 
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
deliberative and then they'll then re-
 
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
reccommend warn articles that have been
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
changed or choose not to to re-
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
reccommend because the original
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation they still agree with her
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been changes or amendments
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
um they they would probably provide
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations on an amended warrant
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
article um so a new warrant article that
 
01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
would be on the warrant um this is kind
 
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
of ambiguous over how that would happen
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
or you know whether or not there'd be
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
like a posting requirement that's done
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
in advance which is something that's
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
required for all the petitioned and the
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
um sorry hearing requirement um in
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
advance which is required for like the
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
regular warn articles and petition warn
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
articles so they'd be making a
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation on a warn article that
 
01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
had never received received a public
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
hearing so that would be an issue
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
too further
 
01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
questions I have a question yes so um is
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
it true that before warrant before
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
articles are placed on the war the
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
warrant does not legal counsel for that
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
body be it the select board or a school
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
board do they not review the language of
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
the article before they're printed on
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
the warrant and then in that case would
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
they not um you know verify the legality
 
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
language yeah certainly I mean you know
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts
 
01:14:38.910 --> 01:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to make sure their legal
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
council reviews it the issue becomes
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
with petition warn articles an example I
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
can point out is in wolfboro there's a
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
warn article to repeal our police
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
commission um it's currently not legally
 
01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
written correctly so if if this were to
 
01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
pass it were to be implemented or were
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
to be required um in that specific
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
specific case that I'm citing then you
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
would have a competing warrant article
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
one where it's an illegal warrant
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
article to repeal the police commission
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
and another that would be legal if there
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
was an actual change made by the
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislative body during deliberative
 
01:15:10.350 --> 01:15:10.360 align:start position:0%
sessions so that's kind of the more you
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
know I wouldn't be worried about the um
 
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
the warrant articles that come from the
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
governing body being illegal but then
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
there's also the issue of when you get
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
to deliberative and there's an amendment
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
made to the governing B's warn article
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
if the Amendments made would be illegal
 
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
then you would have the governing body's
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
original legal War War article and then
 
01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
an amended one by the legislative body
 
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
that would be illegal so I wouldn't
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
imagine the issue would be from the
 
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
governing bodies worn articles it would
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
be from either amendments to the
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
governing bodies or trying to make
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
corrections to petition warn articles so
 
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.590 align:start position:0%
corrections to petition warn articles so
they're

01:15:40.590 --> 01:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
legal further
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
01:15:45.199 --> 01:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
representative

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question the um the the
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
the warrant article if it's
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
illegal what's isn't it or petition
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
warrant article is illegal isn't that
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
usually mocked illegal on a
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
ballot I'm not 100% sure I think it
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
might depend on the municipality uh I
 
01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
don't know what exactly
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I'm going to have to ask
 
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
her legal counsel about that I'll have
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
to you know we'll have to have a
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
conversation I can get back to about
 
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's sh it's illegal any
 
01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
um seeing none that it's my final pink
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%

you so while we're waiting to get a
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
little bit organized here I would like
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
to remind members to pull the
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
microphones close get intimate with your
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
microphone 2 in away from your mouth and
 
01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
slightly lower and then uh with the
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
discovery of this wheel on the side you
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
might want to fiddle with that to see if
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:58.910 --> 01:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
we'll sort that out later maybe she'll
 
01:19:02.679 --> 01:19:08.030 align:start position:0%
we'll sort that out later maybe she'll
explain

01:19:08.030 --> 01:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay so we are scheduled to hear the
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
next bill at 10:30 we're slightly behind
 
01:19:19.629 --> 01:19:19.639 align:start position:0%

01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
before or VAR variations of it
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
I'm uh introducing House Bill 230
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the adoption of Public
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
Health ordinances by
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities and um this body has
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
heard this bill just about every year I
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
believe since um 2021 in various
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
forms um so I apologize if this is like
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
Groundhog Day to some of you I'm going
 
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
to try to go uh swiftly through this the
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
origin of um this bill the J is is the
 
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
mask mandates that some municipalities
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
enacted after
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
2021 however please don't pigeon hole
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
this as a strictly masked mandate bill
 
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
because it is actually there's quite a
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
bit more to it as you will see so um
 
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:49.719 align:start position:0%
just a note about the history of this um
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
like I said since 2021 we've had many
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
iterations of the bill um um and I can
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to forward you a short history
 
01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
of the various language Styles and and
 
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
what we've how we've tackled this bill
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
but however this bill has uh in its
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
various forms has passed the house every
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
year since
 
01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
2021 just a
 
01:21:21.149 --> 01:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
note um so in your first page here
 
01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
um I we I've Got U by the Aster a more
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
complete form of this language so you
 
01:21:32.590 --> 01:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
can see exactly how it looks and I
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
wanted you to pay attention to the title
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
which is nuisances TR toilets drains
 
01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:39.189 align:start position:0%
which is nuisances TR toilets drains
expectoration

01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
expectoration
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
rubbish I think that's important this is
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
regulations um it's on the top page and
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
about halfway down there's an aster or
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
you should have that if you don't have
 
01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
it says public health so the situation
 
01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
is that you know many towns after 2021
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
enacted mask mandates and when I started
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
to look into the whole process I saw
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't just sort of mask
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
mandates that that many people had
 
01:22:12.679 --> 01:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
mandates that that many people had
issues

01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
with um but it was other issues as well
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
as far as it seemed like uh
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities were using this section
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
of law 147 colon 1 to uh to enact all
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of things um and I'll I'll show
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
you why um so it says the health
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
officers of the towns may make
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
regulations for the prevention and
 
01:22:38.950 --> 01:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
removal of nuisances and other such
 
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
regulations related to Public Health as
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
in their judgment people the people
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
require I want to just draw your
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
attention to a couple things nuisances
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
is is cited here now nuisance some
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
people would say that too much paperwork
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
is a nuisance however when you're when
 
01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
you're examining land use law nuisance
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
is narrowly defined as the use and
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of property that's related to
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
property use not Public Health at large
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
such as communicable diseases there is a
 
01:23:16.159 --> 01:23:17.870 align:start position:0%
such as communicable diseases there is a
distinction

01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing here that I want
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
you to notice if you will is that there
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
is no requirement for a public hearing
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
so in other
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
words some municipalities were enacting
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
are enacting certain Public Health
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
regulations with without a requirement
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
for a public hearing um being given here
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
it says Rec the um they they can draw up
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
and draft
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
regulations after and and they shall
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
take effect after being approved by the
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and recorded by a town clerk
 
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
and then they are published but there is
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
no requirement at all for a public
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
hearing so that makes leads me to
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
believe that this section was drawn up
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with such things as nuisances
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
toilets drains rubbish and waste which
 
01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.470 align:start position:0%
toilets drains rubbish and waste which
are

01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
common um aspects of nuisance law and
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
not to tell people they can't have
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
visitors in their homes they have to
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
wear masks in their own home in some
 
01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:30.639 align:start position:0%
cases um and uh also to use it to gate
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
possibly gatekeep uh certain businesses
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
from coming into the tents all right
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to if you flip it
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
over um on the back I've just got some
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
examples um and this is the town of
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
handovers mask mandate they are citing
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
Authority New Hampshire RSA 147 colon
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
one now it's pretty exhaustive and this
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
isn't the whole um I'm going to email
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
you the whole um just trying to cut down
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
on the paper so this is an
 
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
excerpt uh but it just gives you an
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
example of how it is drawn up without uh
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
now many towns did have public hearings
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
so I do want to make a note that the
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
towns for the most part that I examined
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
and I've been to some of the hearings um
 
01:25:23.629 --> 01:25:23.639 align:start position:0%
in some of these towns as they were
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
enacting m mask mandates they did hold
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
public hearings but then they and people
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
objected to the mask mandates
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
but there wasn't any redress that they
 
01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
knew of there that's another thing about
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
this section of laws there's no redress
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
if if if the town's uh if the citizens
 
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
are unhappy I it doesn't really say how
 
01:25:46.990 --> 01:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
to to remedy that um so that's why I
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
again say that there this 147 colon 1 is
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
really meant as an issue to address the
 
01:25:57.189 --> 01:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
property related nuisances that you're
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
all so familiar with pests bugs rubbish
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
offensive uh smells or noise not
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily noises but that sort of
 
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
thing um and so there's an example of
 
01:26:13.229 --> 01:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
the Mask mandate on the back of the
 
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
first page and then I've also
 
01:26:19.149 --> 01:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
included um this ordinance number 40
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
also from the town of Handover and this
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
is where
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
they um
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
and if you open it up I've sort of
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
highlighted on the bottom of the second
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
page where they are limiting gatherings
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
in people's private homes uh to fewer
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
than 10 people not including the people
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
on the property and they also want you
 
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
lists contact information uh this is in
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
your private home uh which is really
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
remarkable to me that it went that
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
far um and as you can see it's not there
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
is there's no clear end date here on
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
number six it just says that it will
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
take effect t uh it will remain in
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
effect until the public health emergency
 
01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
is declared no longer in existence as
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
some of you know a lot of times these
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
Public Health
 
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
Emergency uh statuses in states or
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
federal government are kept going long
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
after the emergency is run its course
 
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.550 align:start position:0%
after the emergency is run its course
because

01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
there's funding that's coming in from
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay so what I have done in
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 230 is we have looked at
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
this and approached it Fromm so many
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
different ways but finally last year I
 
01:27:39.270 --> 01:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
think we finally found something that
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
seems to satisfy everybody on board um
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
for the most part is we've left it still
 
01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:47.830 align:start position:0%
for the most part is we've left it still
quite

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
quite
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
vague I mean this language to me is
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
probably more vague than I I feel
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it to be honest H with
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
you but the Senate um attorney had
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
helped us draft this um and it simply
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
strikes out in anything else because we
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
obviously we don't want
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
any you know it doesn't pertain to any
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
sort of Public Health um issue
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that's this not in the scope
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
of this section of Law and it limits it
 
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
to nuisances and other similar threats
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
so it still leaves some some room there
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
for any sort of thing that might come up
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
but it makes it clear that it's nuisance
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
likee or nuisance
 
01:28:34.109 --> 01:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
adjacent issues that we're we're trying
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
here and briefly while I have your
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
attention is I'm just drawing um some of
 
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
the other things
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
here is um where people municipalities
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
kind of went off as as towns towns like
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
Salem and Atkinson and some other
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
are using this section of law 147 and
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
they are citing it to regulate tattoo
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
parlors in a way that prohibits any
 
01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
tattooing any tattoo parlors from
 
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
operating in town unless they're
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
operated by a medical
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
physician please let me know and uh if
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
you don't have that I will send you the
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
whole article it's quite long here this
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
um know regulate tattoo parlors and um
 
01:29:35.189 --> 01:29:35.199 align:start position:0%
no one shall be uh no tattoo parlor
 
01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
shall operate unless they are operated
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
by a physician now is this gatekeeping
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
or is this public health because that is
 
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
already we already have a license
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
process in effect for um a Statewide
 
01:29:50.790 --> 01:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
license for tattoo parlors and and and
 
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
that that includes body piercing as well
 
01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
that that includes body piercing as well
and

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:59.310 --> 01:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
I think that is this it and I'm happy to
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
take um
 
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions for
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor the chair recognizes
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you madam
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
chairwoman thank you for taking my
 
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
question um I just want to make sure I I
 
01:30:19.709 --> 01:30:19.719 align:start position:0%
understand I if if the if what you're
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do for one RSA
 
01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
1471 is to narrow the scope to
 
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
nuisance I'm wondering how the health
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
officer is going to go
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
beyond toilet strains um and everything
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
else listed in the title if you include
 
01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
the word similar I'm I'm I'm hoping you
 
01:30:43.390 --> 01:30:43.400 align:start position:0%
can explain where the limit if you're
 
01:30:45.669 --> 01:30:45.679 align:start position:0%
trying to limit which I understand and
 
01:30:48.510 --> 01:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
and I get that doesn't similar kind of
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
blow the walls out a little bit to
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
anything or does it rain it into only
 
01:30:57.790 --> 01:30:57.800 align:start position:0%
these one two three four five
 
01:31:00.669 --> 01:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
issues thank you very much and that is a
 
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
fantastic question represent majori um
 
01:31:07.109 --> 01:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
that is a valid question and I am um
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
again this wasn't my wording but the
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
Senate's and if it were up to me I would
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
probably just leave it to nuisances and
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
if the committee wishes for that sort of
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I will gladly draw up that
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
sort of amendment that limits it to
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
nuisances um I'm just left it in because
 
01:31:28.590 --> 01:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
that this uh variation of this this
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
language passed in the
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
Senate um passed in both both bodies I'm
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
sorry for saying Senate and um so I
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
thought I'd start there but if you were
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
if anyone is willing to to uh go with
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
just nuisances and make it absolutely
 
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
clear what it is then I I think that's
 
01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
actually an improvement thank you
 
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:55.430 align:start position:0%

question um if you wished the language

question um if you wished the language

be more specific than the language that
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
you are presenting to us today why
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
didn't you present that to us
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%

representative stavis um
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
I I guess I wasn't clear but I was just
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
in my former comment I said that this is
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
the language that the Senate was happy
 
01:32:28.189 --> 01:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
with we had a more strict
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
version um and more strict versions have
 
01:32:36.030 --> 01:32:36.040 align:start position:0%
been passed by this body um however I'm
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
trying to um also make the Senate happy
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a it's a placee keeping
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
bill and I am certainly willing to um
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
entertain an amendment to it but I
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to get the
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%

147-151 of

1471 uh is adequate and does not need to
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
be changed we do not see any advantage
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
to uh a change in uh in the particular
 
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
sentence that it is a and so we oppose
 
01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.750 align:start position:0%
sentence that it is a and so we oppose
this

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
bill perfect

questions seeing none thank you thank

Dees thank you for taking my testimony
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
today my name is Brody Dees and I
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
Association and um we have been opposed
 
01:34:34.270 --> 01:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
to this bill in its different iterations
 
01:34:36.229 --> 01:34:36.239 align:start position:0%
for the last few years and we are again
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to um House Bill 230 as it's
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
currently written uh to the point of the
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
previous testimony we also agree that
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
language is vague and difficult to be
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
difficult for municipalities and their
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
health officers to be able to interpret
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
and to be able to um to apply um we also
 
01:34:57.239 --> 01:34:59.950 align:start position:0%
and to be able to um to apply um we also
um

01:34:59.950 --> 01:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
specifically the term other similar
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
threats to Public Health we think that's
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
very ambiguous um right now the current
 
01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
language that says and such other
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
regulations relating to public health is
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
pretty clear about um the fact that the
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
regulations need to be related to Public
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
Health um other similar threats would
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
seem to kind of open up to a even
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
broader interpretation actually of what
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
public health officers would be expected
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
to um or allowed to regulate um so with
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
that I will end my testimony and I'll
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you other
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
you oh oh I'm sorry I didn't see you the
 
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative stavis
 
01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question does New Hampshire
 
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association have
 
01:35:58.669 --> 01:35:58.679 align:start position:0%
guidance on the the word
 
01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
similar uh because what we heard in the
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
um presentation of the bill was a desire
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
to narrow the scope of what public
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
health officers can do but the word
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
me has no meaning in law and I'm
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are similar if there
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
are other uh statutes or chapters in
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
which the word similar is used and how
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
it has been interpreted in those
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
statutes to my knowledge I don't think
 
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
we have any legal guidance on the word
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
similar or how uh municipalities should
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
interpret the word similar I mean you
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
know a lot of different statutes that
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
could possibly use the word uh and it
 
01:36:46.510 --> 01:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
would depend maybe on the statute in the
 
01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
context of the situation um I think you
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
know we had an internal conversation and
 
01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know while while we uh don't want
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature to restrict the ability
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
of municipalities and their health
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
officers to establish regulations to
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
promote um public health because
 
01:37:04.590 --> 01:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities have a duty to their
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
residents to promote the the general
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
welfare and the safety of the uh of the
 
01:37:11.709 --> 01:37:11.719 align:start position:0%
of their residents um you know it's one
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
of those things where if while this bill
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
isn't intended to be just for mask
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
mandates it's one of those things where
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
that has been the main impetus and it
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
would probably be easier for
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the health officers
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
to understand the intent of the of the
 
01:37:28.590 --> 01:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
statutes if they were updated if it was
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly just stated no masking
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
requirements um or regulations could be
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
adopted by the health officers or the
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities that to us while we
 
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't support that would be a much
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
more clear and easy to interpret in
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
statute versus the term or other similar
 
01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
threats to Public Health which in in my
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
mind could be construed um to still
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
allow for mask mandates so as it's
 
01:37:54.629 --> 01:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
written because because you know someone
 
01:37:57.550 --> 01:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
could argue that disease is a nuisance
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that you could adopt in in you know
 
01:38:02.589 --> 01:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
that you could still adopt regulations
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
for the prevention and removal of that
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
nuisance so um I don't know if the bill
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
currently has written would even prevent
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
what was the original impetus for
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
updating the statute back starting in
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
2021 you know we know there's been a few
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
iterations of this thank you that was
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
terrific answer to my question further
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
questions seeing N I have one oh I'm
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
sorry I need to I think they're jumping
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
late on you keep looking both ways
 
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
longer the chair recognizes
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman thank you madam
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:38.830 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
testimony

01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
um this uh ordinance as it is uh uses
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
the word
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
regulations um but it's titled Health
 
01:38:50.750 --> 01:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances and forgive me if I haven't
 
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
read all of chapter 147 but
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
um in my town when we change an
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
ordinance we have to have a public
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
hearing we have to have an opportunity
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
for the public to um speak for or
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
against it is that not a um is that just
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
our local issue or is that an issue for
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
every town and City I hav't reviewed the
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
the um the statute uh recently um RSA
 
01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:19.159 align:start position:0%
147 chapter so I'd have to review but I
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
can get back to to see if there is a
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing requirement um but I
 
01:39:24.589 --> 01:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
can't say definitively at the
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
questions so I had
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
one it could you clarify my
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
understanding is it true that with
 
01:39:39.750 --> 01:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
regards to ni Hampshire law if a
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
particular term is not defined under
 
01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.790 align:start position:0%
particular term is not defined under
statutory

01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
construction and or a particular term is
 
01:39:50.669 --> 01:39:50.679 align:start position:0%
not defined within the particular
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
section of law then
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
the Webster dictionary I think it's from
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
the 1960s is what is the common
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
understanding that we look to for the
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
definition of any word that might be
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
bill I am unsure I don't know if that's
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
the case um I can ask our legal counsel
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
about that I'm not personally an
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
attorney I just know that it's more than
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
just um our opposition to the phrase is
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
that um it's not just the word similar
 
01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's the entire phrase while similar is
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
kind of the key word it's just it's
 
01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
open-ended um I think the term similar
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
would isn't you know kind of implies
 
01:40:39.629 --> 01:40:39.639 align:start position:0%
that it could be open-ended and for
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
broad interpretation based on what
 
01:40:42.750 --> 01:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
someone would think in the context of a
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
situation what is similar what's similar
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
to me for something might be different
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
to someone else and um I think some of
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
the issues that this bill is trying to
 
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
address um is to try to create some
 
01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
uniformity and um this wouldn't at least
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
our interpretation this wouldn't create
 
01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
uniformity and um how people treat um

prime sponsor to introduce our his bill
 
01:47:03.629 --> 01:47:03.639 align:start position:0%
to us today thank you madam chairman
 
01:47:05.470 --> 01:47:05.480 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee um
 
01:47:07.709 --> 01:47:07.719 align:start position:0%
very quick bill today I was actually
 
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
hoping it would go to election law but
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
it's totally fine it came here um so as
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
you guys as both sides have heard from
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
the last election property uh voters are
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
screaming about property taxes so I was
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
trying to look at through the lens of
 
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
election law um it came here but I was
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
trying to look through the lens of ction
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
law of how a bill that I could put
 
01:47:27.910 --> 01:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
forward that might help alleviate some
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
of these concerns and when I you look at
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
local elections U most of which are held
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
in March um this bill would only deal
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
with the towns that are using ballots um
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
so this wouldn't really apply to cities
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
but it's when you look at those local
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
elections they are notoriously low
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
turnout um some of them are even like in
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
single digits less than 10% voter
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
turnout and the kind of the conundrum
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
you face elections is the irony is that
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
March election really impacts the voter
 
01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
more than any other election um It's
 
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
kind we say this all the time in
 
01:48:02.189 --> 01:48:02.199 align:start position:0%
election law but nobody really wants to
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it that local election you
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
interact with your local government more
 
01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
than you interact with any other form of
 
01:48:09.589 --> 01:48:09.599 align:start position:0%
government state federal County um you
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
know so you have 84% turnout in the last
 
01:48:13.149 --> 01:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
presidential election they all show up
 
01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%
and they vote for four Electoral College
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
votes that may or may not matter um but
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
but then they just ignore uh the vote
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
that actually sets their personal
 
01:48:22.790 --> 01:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
property taxes um which is the one that
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
they then go on um the very social media
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
and complain about so I started looking
 
01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:28.360 align:start position:0%
at that and I looked under the lens of
 
01:48:30.990 --> 01:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very low turnout election and
 
01:48:32.950 --> 01:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know this body has always valued
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
local control so the question I've
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
always raised this is when is local
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
control not local control right well
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's not local control when you know you
 
01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:43.719 align:start position:0%
have low teen singled digigit voter
 
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
turnout showing up and then setting an
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
agenda that affects you know 85 70 to
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
80% of everyone else and there's a
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons why there's low voter
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
turnout in those elections um and this
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
will not cure that I don't pretend that
 
01:49:01.470 --> 01:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
it will cure that um but what I would
 
01:49:03.790 --> 01:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
like to do is set in a minimum threshold
 
01:49:05.669 --> 01:49:05.679 align:start position:0%
for when we're adopting these budgets or
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
these ballot measures that we're at
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
least getting a certain level of turnout
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
um so that a tiny minority is not
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
imposing its will on the majority so the
 
01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
way this bill would work um it's very
 
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:21.800 align:start position:0%
simple it's you have to have if there's
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
a me if there's a measure me a budget
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
whatever let's just call it measure a
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
for the sake of argument um if there's
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
measure measure a would need at least a
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
it would need a majority of those
 
01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
present and voting to pass that's
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
current law you need a majority of those
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
present and voting to pass but of the
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
people voting for it that that that yes
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
vote needs to be at least 15% of the
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
registered voters so at least 15% of the
 
01:49:48.189 --> 01:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
registered voters need to show up and
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
say yep we want to do that um and they
 
01:49:53.550 --> 01:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
have to have the majority of those
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
um present and voting and the reason you
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
have to add those reason you have to
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
have those two Provisions is you can't
 
01:50:02.910 --> 01:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
just do a baseline turnout because if
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
you do a baseline turnout you say you
 
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
have to have at least 15% turnout period
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
right if you if you do that you
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
encourage non-participation because by
 
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
staying home you actually are making it
 
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
harder to hit the threshold so this is a
 
01:50:19.470 --> 01:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
way to encourage people to show up they
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
you won't discourage them from voting um
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
but I think it will ALS so at least make
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
sure that if we're adopting ballot
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
measures that they are there's at least
 
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
a very low minimum of registered voters
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
saying yes this is fine um so you know I
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
know I know how conquered Works it'll
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
probably take years for this sort of
 
01:50:40.709 --> 01:50:40.719 align:start position:0%
concept to to sink in but I do think
 
01:50:43.629 --> 01:50:43.639 align:start position:0%
it's something that we should look at um
 
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have a tiny minority
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
imposing its will on a majority um and I
 
01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
kind of want to give excuse once again
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
election law guy here so I'm kind of
 
01:50:56.189 --> 01:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
going to give an example of uh these
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
elections aren't inherently equal in the
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
people that are interested in them right
 
01:51:05.870 --> 01:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
so let's say there is a a measure to
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
give uh the school 10% pay raises right
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
um measure comes it's going to be in the
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
budget right it's going to be part of
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
the school budget well the teachers
 
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
union is very incentivized um in fact
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's its job right to go and advocate
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
for that position right and they get
 
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
dues from their members um so they're
 
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
going to participate in that election
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to encourage their members
 
01:51:28.030 --> 01:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
to vote they're going to encourage
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
voters to vote they're going to Advocate
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
their position that is their right they
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
are totally that's not a problem that's
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
totally their right to do that the
 
01:51:37.350 --> 01:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
problem is is the people who will be
 
01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
impacted on that are not as incentivized
 
01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
to fight it financially so uh give you
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
an example let's say um in my proposal
 
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
this pay increase would result in a
 
01:51:50.830 --> 01:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
teacher getting an $8 to $9,000 pay
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
increase but it may only raise my taxes
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
$500 well if I'm going to go and
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the election at the same
 
01:51:58.870 --> 01:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
level that the teachers union is
 
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
participating they're they're using
 
01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:01.719 align:start position:0%
money they're sending mailers they're
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
doing whatever right they're
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
participating in the election as is
 
01:52:07.709 --> 01:52:07.719 align:start position:0%
their right um I then have to decide am
 
01:52:09.790 --> 01:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
I going to spend the the most that I can
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
spend to justify my my my going into
 
01:52:14.669 --> 01:52:14.679 align:start position:0%
this election would be 500 bucks because
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's the most I stand to lose in
 
01:52:18.270 --> 01:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
theory as a taxpayer right obviously
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
that's just opposed with the fact that
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to be getting better
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
Services too so that 500 $ is not really
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
$500 it might internally be like $250 so
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
these aren't Fair fights um when it
 
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
comes to these local levels with who's
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
participating and you're never going to
 
01:52:35.709 --> 01:52:35.719 align:start position:0%
be able to seek absolute balance um
 
01:52:36.669 --> 01:52:36.679 align:start position:0%
you're never going to be able to get
 
01:52:38.069 --> 01:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
perfect balance in the political process
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
it's just not possible um but I I do
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
think when it comes to these sort of
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
things that we should be having a
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
process where at least enough people are
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
participating that we can kind of
 
01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
credibly say the public wanted this you
 
01:52:52.990 --> 01:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
know you're not I didn't set this at 5%
 
01:52:54.669 --> 01:52:54.679 align:start position:0%
have to do it I didn't say 50% turnout
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know I set a really low bar of 15%
 
01:53:00.270 --> 01:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
of the voters need to show up and say
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
they want this and they need to be in
 
01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:05.079 align:start position:0%
the majority and um you know I I say all
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
the time and I'll kind of end my remarks
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
with this is you know when are the the
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
way we do our town budget is a
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
democratic process um we don't have a
 
01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
democratic form of government we have a
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
republican form of government but our
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
town government is actually very Dem
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
Democratic it's it's we literally have a
 
01:53:23.510 --> 01:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
budget and it's direct Dem Ry and people
 
01:53:24.910 --> 01:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
show up and they vote on it that that is
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
that is actually the definition of a
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
democracy of something that is direct
 
01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
like that um so when does a democratic
 
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
process yield a non-democratic outcome
 
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
well when you have really really really
 
01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
low turnout so my hope is that by
 
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
setting a threshold both sides will
 
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
engage more and the turnout will go up
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
and this 15% won't even be an issue um
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
because the turnout will will escalate a
 
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
little bit this won't be the the panace
 
01:53:51.750 --> 01:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
of cure all for that there's other
 
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
problems that occur with it but I do
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
think that if we're going to be raising
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
property taxes which is what spending
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
does spending raises property taxes if
 
01:54:01.589 --> 01:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to be doing that I think we
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
should have some semblance of the
 
01:54:05.950 --> 01:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
consent of the Govern um and I by
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
setting a minimum threshold for people
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
showing up in voting yes um I think you
 
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
get closer to that admittedly not
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
perfect and with that I'm willing to uh
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
take the arguments about why I'm
 
01:54:18.510 --> 01:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
horribly wrong which I'm sure about to
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
come so thank you representative Barry
 
01:54:21.119 --> 01:54:23.310 align:start position:0%
come so thank you representative Barry
questions

01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair hardly
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
know where to begin representative
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot in there right it's it's
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
like a like a six six line bill but it's
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's like whoa that's a different
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
concept are you saying that if
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
14% of Voters turned out to pass a
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
certain warrant
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
article that would be illegitimate if if
 
01:54:56.189 --> 01:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
this law were to pass and would those
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
people not be disenfranchised from their
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
votes uh no because there it's you know
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
the it's a great example you give
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative and uh conversely I would
 
01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:07.719 align:start position:0%
say if one person showed up and they
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
were the only ones who voted would that
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
be representative of the body as a whole
 
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the like are you
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising it um the reality is is
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's you're really you're you're
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
approaching more of an oligarchy when
 
01:55:22.470 --> 01:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
you get very low turnout where very few
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
people are making the decisions so I
 
01:55:26.189 --> 01:55:26.199 align:start position:0%
want to try to encourage people to show
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
up and vote and I think if people if
 
01:55:30.750 --> 01:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
there's a minimum threshold of you got
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
to show up and say yes to get this done
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think that's different
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we do use there's this not the only
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
example of a minimum threshold in New
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law um many of you will
 
01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
probably remember the case out of cin
 
01:55:45.390 --> 01:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
where they showed up at deliberative and
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
they slashed the school funding in half
 
01:55:50.669 --> 01:55:50.679 align:start position:0%
right and you know once again it's an
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
example of a minority in imposing its
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
will on a majority through a process
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
that doesn't that is in fact in theory
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
Democratic but didn't yield a democratic
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
outcome right um and what happened is
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
the community came together they had a
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
huge vote um they had to get at least
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
50% of the registered voters there right
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
to then undo what they did in
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
deliberative so we actually do have
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
thresholds built into into other parts
 
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:17.560 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire election law um we just
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
rarely see them and the great irony is
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
is we only see them when a Democrat
 
01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:24.920 align:start position:0%
process yields a non-democratic outcome
 
01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to kind of work in that
 
01:56:30.990 --> 01:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
same vein of how do we get a democratic
 
01:56:34.069 --> 01:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
process to yield a democratic
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
outcome further questions the chair
 
01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
and if
 
01:56:48.069 --> 01:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
the thank you representative for taking
 
01:56:51.350 --> 01:56:51.360 align:start position:0%
my question if the if the election
 
01:56:53.470 --> 01:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the
 
01:56:57.550 --> 01:56:57.560 align:start position:0%
criteria then that would seem to render
 
01:57:00.510 --> 01:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
the default budget to to to fall into
 
01:57:04.750 --> 01:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
place which we we know in in
 
01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
today's uh situation sometimes the
 
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
default budget is even more than the
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
proposed budget is that is that the uh
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that you have also that
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding and it certainly
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
is an outcome and in my town of wear um
 
01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
the school budget put forward is
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
actually lower in the first year uh than
 
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
the default budget would be um but
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're acting change right
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
now normally let's be honest normally
 
01:57:34.030 --> 01:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
it's an increase right um the cases
 
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
where the default is lower than the
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
proposed is not imposs but it's not the
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
normal um so once again to my underlying
 
01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
point of I'd like to see some this uses
 
01:57:46.069 --> 01:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
some restraint measure on property taxes
 
01:57:47.229 --> 01:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
I think in the majority of times they
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
would have that case uh in the case I
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
just referenced in wear with the school
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
budget the
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
proposed school budget is lower than the
 
01:57:56.910 --> 01:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
default budget but when you break open
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
the transportation contract you realize
 
01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
that years two three four and five would
 
01:58:02.069 --> 01:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
actually be an increase over what the
 
01:58:04.030 --> 01:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
default budget would do um and that's
 
01:58:06.430 --> 01:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
not a trick or nobody's playing dirty
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's just one of the things like unless
 
01:58:10.589 --> 01:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
you know to look down the road you you
 
01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
you you would think that it's lower but
 
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
in most cases the default budget is
 
01:58:16.069 --> 01:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
lower uh and I think we're handling
 
01:58:17.310 --> 01:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
legislation obviously we're not talking
 
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
about other legislation right now but I
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
think we're handing legislation that
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
would address that concern as well um
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't come for me so don't
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
ask me questions about it thank you the
 
01:58:28.750 --> 01:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
01:58:30.990 --> 01:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair and thank
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um collective
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining Agreements are placed on
 
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
ballots uh as warrant articles should
 
01:58:40.589 --> 01:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
these warrants not pass then a special
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
meeting would be
 
01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
required um if at the time of the
 
01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
special meeting less than 15% of Voters
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh participate and say yes uh what would
 
01:58:55.629 --> 01:58:55.639 align:start position:0%
the next steps be for a municipality
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so uh I don't think that's built
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
into this it certainly wasn't my
 
01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
intention to go after the meetings uh
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
the deliver sessions I have my own
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
issues with those but it's not trying to
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
address that in here I'm trying to aim
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
for the town vote um so you know
 
01:59:08.910 --> 01:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
honestly if they if they don't do it
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
what you what the committee does after
 
01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
that I leave it in your best um best
 
01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
interest I want to propose the concept
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
and understand once again I said in my
 
01:59:17.790 --> 01:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
testimony I understand how conquer works
 
01:59:19.390 --> 01:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
is if we talk about it enough we might
 
01:59:20.830 --> 01:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
be able to work it in in the future but
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
probably not here
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative Guth three Guthrie I got
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
you I got you thank you madam chair and
 
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
I really if really you just indicated
 
01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:38.990 align:start position:0%
I really if really you just indicated
the

01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
concept uh do you feel that uh people
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
have the right not to
 
01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
vote oh certainly they do representative
 
01:59:49.069 --> 01:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
Guthrie and I actually have dealt with
 
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
that before in election law um I would
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
make the statement let's say you have a
 
01:59:54.629 --> 01:59:54.639 align:start position:0%
15% voter turnout I would probably make
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
the statement that 85% of the voters
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
didn't choose to stay home they but just
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
with the way we've set up our town
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
elections is you know we've every single
 
02:00:05.910 --> 02:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
town has the right to choose a partisan
 
02:00:07.229 --> 02:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
ballot not a single town in New
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has done so um when you leave
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
those sort of things off of the ballot
 
02:00:14.669 --> 02:00:14.679 align:start position:0%
the average voter is um kind of unformed
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
on these issues it's just it's not a
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
condemnation of people it's just it's a
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
fact of life is they elect people like
 
02:00:22.589 --> 02:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
us to try to go and make decisions and
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be hyper informed but
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
they've left these Town ballots with the
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
way they're set up and the information
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
that goes out with them and I know the
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
town sends out a mailer um but they kind
 
02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
of left these things to where most
 
02:00:35.790 --> 02:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
voters don't know what to do and to
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan's point is if the
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
default budget might be higher than the
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
proposed budget but in the case of where
 
02:00:43.629 --> 02:00:43.639 align:start position:0%
I happen to know that the default
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
budget's actually better than the
 
02:00:46.950 --> 02:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
proposed budget even though it's lower
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
even though it's higher um there's a lot
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
of moving pieces here but I think
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately my goal is try to get more
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
people to participate and I don't think
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're participating due to lack of
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
Interest I think they're participating
 
02:00:59.550 --> 02:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
due to lack of understanding and I do
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
have other bills that won't go through
 
02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
this committee that try to demystify
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
that process a little bit um but you
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
know it's like with anything not
 
02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
everything's going to pass so you try to
 
02:01:13.109 --> 02:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
take multiple runs of things follow up M
 
02:01:17.229 --> 02:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
yes I mean I'm just trying to uh think
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
about what could happen if you uh people
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
went to vote and they you got you got
 
02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:24.679 align:start position:0%
less than
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
15% you're penal penalizing those people
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
who did show up because they didn't get
 
02:01:34.950 --> 02:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
enough people there to vote and do you
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
think that's a good concept uh well they
 
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
didn't they didn't get enough people
 
02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
there to support something with be I
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
would look at it right so for whatever
 
02:01:43.709 --> 02:01:43.719 align:start position:0%
reason their argument wasn't convincing
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
enough to get at least 15% of the town
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
to go and do something so their argument
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
was either unconvincing or people didn't
 
02:01:52.270 --> 02:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
know about the election once again
 
02:01:53.470 --> 02:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
another problem with our town elections
 
02:01:56.470 --> 02:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
is they're held over multiple months so
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
every Town's got a different one and
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
they're you know it's not like with the
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
state general election where everybody
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
knows it's the first Tuesday after the
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
first Monday in the even Year everybody
 
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
knows the whole state goes and votes
 
02:02:08.430 --> 02:02:08.440 align:start position:0%
there's a big campaign around it there's
 
02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
just not that turnout because we've let
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
this town process just be kind of every
 
02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
Town's a little different we have fp2
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
towns they're all little they're all
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
convoluted some of them are doing Town
 
02:02:18.390 --> 02:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
meetings some of them are doing Del
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
sessions right they're all there's this
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
local control option which is great but
 
02:02:25.390 --> 02:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
because it's not uniform because the
 
02:02:27.390 --> 02:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
process is kind of mystified you get
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
this really really low turnout and in
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
that situation a minority can impose its
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
will on the majority and that's what I'm
 
02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
trying to not solve because this
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't Solve IT solving it would
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
require 50% to turn out and vote Yes
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
right that would that would be a true
 
02:02:44.189 --> 02:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
consent of the Govern right but I also
 
02:02:45.669 --> 02:02:45.679 align:start position:0%
live in the reality that that's never
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
going to happen either but I think 15%
 
02:02:50.589 --> 02:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
is such a low threshold uh that it's
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
almost it almost shouldn't be an issue I
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
mean if the committee wanted to amend it
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
to anything it's there's really like
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
what number would you pick should it be
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
1% 2% should it be if one person shows
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
up and they're the only one who votes
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
that they get to decide the town budget
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
for everybody else right at at some
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
point they turnout so low that the
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
results not legitimate right and that's
 
02:03:11.470 --> 02:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what I'm going after is if we
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
don't get more people voting in these
 
02:03:15.149 --> 02:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
things you're not getting an actual
 
02:03:16.750 --> 02:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
Democratic outcome and I would hope that
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
everyone in here would want Democratic
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes in our Democratic process I
 
02:03:21.430 --> 02:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
would assume if I went through and asked
 
02:03:23.830 --> 02:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
you would all say Yes um so I'm trying
 
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:25.960 align:start position:0%
to get to that underlying point of how
 
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
do we get an outcome especially on
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
things as important as property taxes
 
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
that appear to be more democratic um so
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're at least you're getting some
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
consent of the Govern because that is a
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
core part of a democracy is having
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
consent of the
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
Govern further further questions yes
 
02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:46.360 align:start position:0%
no representative Gilman thank you madam
 
02:03:47.709 --> 02:03:47.719 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I understand the
 
02:03:56.790 --> 02:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to um get some real
 
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh weight behind spending items um my
 
02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:01.790 align:start position:0%
uh weight behind spending items um my
question

02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
is budgets uh proposed and default are
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
in one article so what H what budget do
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
you get if only 133% of the voters turn
 
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
out so what I sent to OS and I didn't
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
get a chance to rewrite because I was on
 
02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
was one of the people that got caught up
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the deadline um was I I I said go it
 
02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
would go to default so it's spending a
 
02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
stand R would fail right so if they were
 
02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
doing you know a new community center
 
02:04:28.030 --> 02:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
right uh that would just fail and the
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
budget would go to default that was my
 
02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
intention with the
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
legislation I had to it was one of those
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh you either get to take this or not
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
sort of bills so I took what I had and I
 
02:04:38.189 --> 02:04:38.199 align:start position:0%
figured I would go and plead my case and
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
see what you guys wanted to do which I
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
also live in reality so the chair
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
France thank you madam chairman and
 
02:04:50.830 --> 02:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
pardon me for being ignorant in this but
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
do small towns that aren't sb2 have
 
02:05:00.549 --> 02:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
default budgets I've never been aware uh
 
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
I believe they do but I could be wrong
 
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
on that I I wouldn't like I said I don't
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
I don't pretend to understand the
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
workings of that at that level that's a
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
uuy thing um I I said I intended this
 
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
bill to come through my committee where
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
I would just work on the election law
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
part of it and then hand it off to you
 
02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
guys and you guys would solve those
 
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
details so um but I think the my guess
 
02:05:18.350 --> 02:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
is the speaker looked at this and saw I
 
02:05:20.229 --> 02:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
had 75 bills and went we'll go over here
 
02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
first but I said I'm I'm here to answer
 
02:05:25.750 --> 02:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the process part of it and you
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
guys with understand that every single
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
one of you has a knowledge of that much
 
02:05:31.549 --> 02:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
deeper than mine I would never I
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even try to compete with you on
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
that did you have a followup followup
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
please yes um so in a small town if you
 
02:05:40.750 --> 02:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the
 
02:05:42.629 --> 02:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
turnout of the
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
15% does that mean the budget just
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass and you'd have to have
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
another meeting so um that's once again
 
02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's a process question for you my my
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
u um I I break that down the size of the
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
town does not matter because it's a
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
percent of the registered voters so the
 
02:06:00.549 --> 02:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
size of the town is totally irrelevant
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's not you need 100 voters showing up
 
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's you need 15% so the size of the
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
town is it doesn't matter it could be it
 
02:06:09.629 --> 02:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
could be marac um it could be London
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
Derry doesn't matter um it could be
 
02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
dickville Notch I just most of the
 
02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
township but you get my point um you
 
02:06:18.549 --> 02:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
know how you guys would handle the
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
implications of it I would actually
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the committee because
 
02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
every Town's a little different once
 
02:06:24.109 --> 02:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
again this doesn't even apply to cities
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
cities don't vote on their budgets um
 
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's done by a city council so this is
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
actually just going after a very Niche
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
people who've chosen the town balloting
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
system um to adopt budgets and where it
 
02:06:36.549 --> 02:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
goes from there you know there obviously
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
needs to be a budget they can't just
 
02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
cease functioning you definitely don't
 
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
want what happen conversely you don't
 
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
want what happened in Cordon where in
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
deliberative session you know 15 guys
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
show up and uh and cut your school
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
additional questions the chair
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative
 
02:06:59.229 --> 02:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
you represent for taking my question um
 
02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
so do you think there could actually be
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
an incentive for people to not show up
 
02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
because if they don't want to vot if
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
they want the votes to fail if they want
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
the spending to fail why would they show
 
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
up that's why thank you for raising that
 
02:07:19.350 --> 02:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
question and Madam chair not to be rude
 
02:07:21.149 --> 02:07:21.159 align:start position:0%
I have to go to my work here in a minute
 
02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
so I could one more after this I'm not
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
trying to dodge as you could tell I
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
could love to have this for a while I
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
enjoy this conversation I specifically
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
wrote it in a way to where that wasn't
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
an issue um so the reason it's written
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
in the way is because it's 15% voting
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
for it to pass so staying home does
 
02:07:41.390 --> 02:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
nothing staying home does nothing
 
02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
because if 15% show up and say yes and
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
you want to vote no you still need to
 
02:07:48.270 --> 02:07:48.280 align:start position:0%
show up because you could be if you have
 
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
a if you have 30% turnout right
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
you could be the 51st vote percentage
 
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
wise that stops the majority so this the
 
02:08:00.149 --> 02:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
way it's it's it's specifically written
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
to to not encourage people to stay home
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's specifically written in a way to
 
02:08:07.709 --> 02:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
encourage people to vote but the people
 
02:08:09.189 --> 02:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
who want the spending to pass are
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
admittedly more encouraged to show up to
 
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
vote um but there is no there is no
 
02:08:16.430 --> 02:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
bonus for staying home that that doesn't
 
02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
Advance your cause at all and in fact
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
because you need a majority uh it
 
02:08:22.629 --> 02:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
actually because the people wanting the
 
02:08:24.669 --> 02:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
spending need a majority it actually
 
02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
encourages people who are against the
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
spending to show up as well because they
 
02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:29.320 align:start position:0%
now know that the other side is going to
 
02:08:32.109 --> 02:08:32.119 align:start position:0%
be showing people up the whole thing is
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
designed conceptually to drive
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
turnout thank you at this point the
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Murphy
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:08:44.310 --> 02:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative what about petition
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
warrant articles that have money
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
involved yep uh so my intention was to
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
include that in this in this is if it's
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
a spending item you need 15% and a
 
02:08:56.910 --> 02:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
majority you need 15% voting yes and
 
02:09:01.430 --> 02:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
no and I I I do I I really I'm happy to
 
02:09:05.709 --> 02:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
come back if you guys want to keep
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
calling this but I I my my staff's going
 
02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
to start calling me ask me where I'm at

handle this we have a few other
 
02:09:19.229 --> 02:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
questions could could he give the
 
02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
question to me and I could forward it to
 
02:09:21.159 --> 02:09:22.270 align:start position:0%
question to me and I could forward it to
you

02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
you

you can distribute the answer to
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%

funnel it through me I'll pass it to
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative Barry and I'm sorry to do
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
that to you guys I normally love
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
answering questions I just I literally
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
have people watch get an answer for you
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
Barry at at this time the chair
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:59.830 --> 02:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
um again for the record uh Brody desay
 
02:10:01.069 --> 02:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
representing the nire municipal
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
Association I appreciate you guys taking
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
my testimony uh this
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
morning yep it's still morning just want
 
02:10:09.149 --> 02:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
to check um we the New Hampshire
 
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association is opposed to um
 
02:10:17.069 --> 02:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
House Bill 407 I I think the most cinct
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
way I can start is you can lead a horse
 
02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
to water but you can't make him drink I
 
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
mean SP2 towns can have uh preliminary
 
02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
hearings and the hearing requirements
 
02:10:28.149 --> 02:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
for their warrant and their budget um
 
02:10:29.709 --> 02:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
they can post these warrants publicly
 
02:10:31.709 --> 02:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
well in advance of the deliberative they
 
02:10:34.109 --> 02:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
can discuss and deliberate at the
 
02:10:36.270 --> 02:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
deliberative session and then they have
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know typically a few weeks up to
 
02:10:40.270 --> 02:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
maybe even over a month for the
 
02:10:42.030 --> 02:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
community to write to the newspaper to
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
influence each other influence the
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
governing body Etc on the final boote on
 
02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
the final vote um SP2 has never had a
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
quorum requirements and this bill would
 
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
it would impose a quum requirement and
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
that's one that's not done for
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
traditional Town meetings and to kind of
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
treat the two as dissimilar processes is
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
um kind of not in Tradition with what
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
the legislature has historically done
 
02:11:06.350 --> 02:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
what towns have supported and what I
 
02:11:07.549 --> 02:11:07.559 align:start position:0%
think the voters and the residents of
 
02:11:10.750 --> 02:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire have expected um we also
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
think people's lack of Interest or you
 
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
know to the representative who spoke
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
before he claimed understanding we think
 
02:11:18.189 --> 02:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
it has more to do with interests because
 
02:11:19.790 --> 02:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
if they were interested they would
 
02:11:21.549 --> 02:11:21.559 align:start position:0%
follow the process and Gain
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
understanding um it shouldn't overrule
 
02:11:25.149 --> 02:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
the will of the voters who are willing
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
to show up and participate in the
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
process um because people don't show up
 
02:11:31.270 --> 02:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean they are opposed either
 
02:11:33.149 --> 02:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
there are some people who say you know
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm busy that week or I'm out of town or
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
ET they have a myriad of reasons we
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
could never imagine every single
 
02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
individual Granite stator's reasons for
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
why they do or don't show up to um to
 
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
vote at uh at the second session in SP2
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
towns for town
 
02:11:52.109 --> 02:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
meeting um I do want to point point out
 
02:11:56.149 --> 02:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
the um not just the whole issue of
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
having a quorum requirement and it being
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
imposed and that being a uh a a
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
restriction on communities I I do want
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
to point out two major technical issues
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
one is it calls in the question whether
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
anything like a default budget or a
 
02:12:11.149 --> 02:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement could
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
pass because 15% of people may not show
 
02:12:18.270 --> 02:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
up but all of a sudden you have
 
02:12:22.109 --> 02:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
14.99% of people show up um arguably
 
02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
nothing can pass I mean because You'
 
02:12:25.709 --> 02:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
have you have a quorum requirement the
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
second session of s SP2 essentially it's
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
n and void for the most part there's
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
also something uh Worth to be said and I
 
02:12:34.750 --> 02:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
bet some of the moderators on uh your
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
committee would understand is the term
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
registered voters in the town that is
 
02:12:41.430 --> 02:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
not the phrase that's used typically um
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
for SP2 of how many voters are able you
 
02:12:46.510 --> 02:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
know were are registered um with the
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
town it's actually um it's actually the
 
02:12:52.109 --> 02:12:52.119 align:start position:0%
checklist that's post posted the Friday
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
before um voting so you'd have to use
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
that specific phrasing so even for towns
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
to try to implement and figure out what
 
02:12:58.440 --> 02:12:59.229 align:start position:0%
to try to implement and figure out what
is

02:12:59.229 --> 02:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
15% they wouldn't you know the the voter
 
02:13:04.189 --> 02:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
checklist that they have is not um
 
02:13:06.910 --> 02:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily you know this term this
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
terminology doesn't jive correctly with
 
02:13:10.589 --> 02:13:10.599 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
statutes um and I'll kind of end too is
 
02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
that um communities If This Were to pass
 
02:13:18.430 --> 02:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
I would imagine would get very concerned
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
about being able to have these quorums
 
02:13:22.109 --> 02:13:22.119 align:start position:0%
and um it might incentivize the
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
governing body to try to return back to
 
02:13:25.549 --> 02:13:25.559 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting and the purpose
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
of s SP2 and it was originally passed
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
was to try to encourage participation in
 
02:13:31.549 --> 02:13:31.559 align:start position:0%
the process and to try to make it easier
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
for towns um and for their residents to
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
be able to vote so you know we you know
 
02:13:38.109 --> 02:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of bills that have come
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
before this committee to try to change
 
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
the process for SP2 towns and how they
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
conduct their um their annual Town
 
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
meetings and you know it makes the most
 
02:13:49.629 --> 02:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
sense to try to create some to make sure
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
that the two syst of traditional town
 
02:13:55.149 --> 02:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
meeting and SP2 towns mirror each other
 
02:13:57.750 --> 02:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
um as reasonably as possible um as much
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
as possible so with that I will answer
 
02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you other
 
02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair thank you um
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony um I'd like to
 
02:14:15.870 --> 02:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
pose a question to you and and
 
02:14:19.229 --> 02:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
definitely okay it's just a hypothetical
 
02:14:22.669 --> 02:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
um if a grant was tied to a article um
 
02:14:26.910 --> 02:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
bridgade under using this language would
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
the municipality then have to give up a
 
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
parent you know a possible million doll
 
02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:36.950 align:start position:0%
parent you know a possible million doll
Grant

02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
um because the 15% voter threshold
 
02:14:40.639 --> 02:14:41.589 align:start position:0%
um because the 15% voter threshold
wasn't

02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
met yeah and thank you for the question
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative under this bill if 15% of
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
people don't show
 
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
up then nothing passes if 15% of people
 
02:14:55.629 --> 02:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
do show up it still needs to pass but if
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
you have a warrant article that's
 
02:14:59.109 --> 02:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
constructed that is we need to raise
 
02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
this amount of money and appropriate it
 
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to access this Max matching
 
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
Grant well the warn article dies doesn't
 
02:15:08.990 --> 02:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
pass so and again you know having this
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
cor requirement you know I think the the
 
02:15:14.510 --> 02:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is that your second
 
02:15:16.510 --> 02:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
session your town meeting essentially
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
would be just null and void even if the
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
voters showed up who show up and want to
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
participate and care about what's
 
02:15:24.510 --> 02:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
happening in the community um their
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
voices would essentially the legislative
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
body would just be canceled out by other
 
02:15:31.470 --> 02:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
folks lack of Interest or lack of
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
concern and um that to us doesn't seem
 
02:15:36.189 --> 02:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
fair and it could really
 
02:15:38.589 --> 02:15:38.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities and cities and basically
 
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
make all govering functions kind of halt
 
02:15:45.990 --> 02:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
um so that's a huge concern thank
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
you for other
 
02:15:52.709 --> 02:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative Davis um thank
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I have a question for
 
02:15:54.239 --> 02:15:55.149 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I have a question for
the

02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:01.229 --> 02:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee we haven't had that um
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
discussion as of yet we're in the
 
02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
unknown representative majori thank you
 
02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and maybe this is
 
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
getting to the weeds and you've just
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
answered this but even a bond that
 
02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
received three fifths
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
and passed but not for not 15% that
 
02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
would still fail correct if 15% of so I
 
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
think the intent is for it to be the the
 
02:16:36.589 --> 02:16:36.599 align:start position:0%
folks who are on the voter checklist in
 
02:16:39.150 --> 02:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
the community but it's currently written
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's not the current verbiage or
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
wording but I think the intent was for
 
02:16:48.509 --> 02:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
you needed at least 15% of people on the
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
voter checklist to show up to be able to
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
pass or to be able to pass any worn
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
article and so not only would you need
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
in that case of a bonded one you need
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
15% cor cor requirements so 15% of those
 
02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
people on the voter checklist to at
 
02:17:06.910 --> 02:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
least cast a vote and then you still
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
then need to meet that three-fifths
 
02:17:11.830 --> 02:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
requirement as as required in statute to
 
02:17:14.509 --> 02:17:14.519 align:start position:0%
pass the bonding issue so um I mean you
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
try to bond something at with this I I
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't imagine very rarely would
 
02:17:20.669 --> 02:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
communities be able to to be able to get
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
something pass it have to be
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
um you'd have to do a lot to encourage
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
your legislative body and the residents
 
02:17:29.549 --> 02:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
of your community to get out and it'
 
02:17:31.270 --> 02:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
have to be um something that they're
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
very passionate about so and not
 
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
everyone is as passionate about local
 
02:17:37.629 --> 02:17:37.639 align:start position:0%
government as all of us in this room
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
so so representative stavis I'd like to
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
apologize I misunderstood or
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
misprocessed your question I thought
 
02:17:48.669 --> 02:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
that you said subcommittee when um I
 
02:17:50.549 --> 02:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
clarified it with the vice chair that in
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
fact you said second committee correct
 
02:17:57.549 --> 02:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
So my answer was was misguided and
 
02:18:00.910 --> 02:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
incorrect this bill is has only been
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
referred to this committee so the answer
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
correct answer is no it will not go to a
 
02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:11.110 align:start position:0%
correct answer is no it will not go to a
second

02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee further
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions no seeing none thank you oh oh
 
02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I didn't representative
 
02:18:22.910 --> 02:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair I apologize
 
02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
and this may be an ill-informed question
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
so I apologize in
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
advance under Quorum requirement if you
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
don't meet the Quorum requirement you
 
02:18:33.479 --> 02:18:34.669 align:start position:0%
don't meet the Quorum requirement you
can't

02:18:34.669 --> 02:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
can't
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
proceed so if this imposes a quorum
 
02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
requirement and 15% of the voters aren't
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
there can you even have a
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
vote our interpretation would be yes you
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
can have the vote because town meeting
 
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
is throughout the entire voting day so
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
you're just you know you're waiting you
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
know people are showing up as the town
 
02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
meeting goes on throughout the entire
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
second session which is the voting day
 
02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
um but essentially a town meeting
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have happened once you get to
 
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the day and your supervisor
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
of the checklist and your moderator and
 
02:19:08.910 --> 02:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
your town clerk says oh 15% of people
 
02:19:11.709 --> 02:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
up yes so in fact the election really
 
02:19:18.389 --> 02:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have happened correct
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
essentially so you'd be uh you'd be ad
 
02:19:21.389 --> 02:19:21.399 align:start position:0%
minister thank you for the question
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
you'd be essentially administering an
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
election and crossing your fingers on a
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
hope and a prayer that 15% of people
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
showed up and that actually counted
 
02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
otherwise um there's no real Provisions
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
in this statute and I have to review the
 
02:19:35.709 --> 02:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
statutes more to be completely
 
02:19:38.110 --> 02:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
definitive of this but how you would go
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
about addressing Warren articles that
 
02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
failed that even you know they 14% of
 
02:19:45.309 --> 02:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
people showed up they passed they might
 
02:19:46.589 --> 02:19:46.599 align:start position:0%
have pass overwhelmingly but you didn't
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
meet to quum requirements so you're
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to have a special meeting
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
and obviously special meetings
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
themselves have qu requirements and I I
 
02:19:56.590 --> 02:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
do want to if I could address that um
 
02:19:58.750 --> 02:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
there's a reason why special meetings
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
have Quorum requirements and that's
 
02:20:02.389 --> 02:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
because it's the state of New Hampshire
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature has decided that if the
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
governing body or even a petitioners of
 
02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
the legislative body really want to add
 
02:20:12.630 --> 02:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
supplemental funds to a budget or
 
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
something of that nature or to you know
 
02:20:17.309 --> 02:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
change the previous outcome of a vote
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
that you know you're basically kind of
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
redoing a previous vote and so they want
 
02:20:25.349 --> 02:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
overwhelming amount of support um in
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
this case this is kind of the
 
02:20:28.510 --> 02:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
traditional town meeting structure so
 
02:20:30.389 --> 02:20:30.399 align:start position:0%
you know you would essentially be saying
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah without that Quorum requirement um
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
for the initial uh it's no and void it
 
02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
so the chair recognizes representative
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
um what going to happen on article one
 
02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
and article one is the election of all
 
02:20:57.630 --> 02:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
officers in the town Board of Selectmen
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
Tom moderator supervisors of the
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
checklist Trustees of the library
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
Trustees of the trust fund all those
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
elections are now null and void didn't
 
02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
happen you didn't meet the Corum
 
02:21:10.750 --> 02:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
requirement at the second session then
 
02:21:12.910 --> 02:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
addition I would imagine the town would
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
have to pay for those additional costs
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
for second election yeah know and that's
 
02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
where it gets really complicated cuz
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the money thank you for the
 
02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
question and with
 
02:21:23.710 --> 02:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to interrupt so the question
 
02:21:25.270 --> 02:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
that he
 
02:21:29.150 --> 02:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
asked pertained to spending items
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
article one which is election of
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
officers in the clear text of the bill
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
pertains to spending items so perhaps um
 
02:21:39.439 --> 02:21:40.349 align:start position:0%
pertains to spending items so perhaps um
Mr

02:21:40.349 --> 02:21:40.359 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
des's um missed that so quickly refine
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
your answer yes thank you no wouldn't be
 
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
related because that's not a spending
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
item and I appreciate the chair's
 
02:21:52.950 --> 02:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
additional

02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%

03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
Certified Recovery recovery homes in the
 
03:37:53.510 --> 03:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
state with a total of nearly 1,300 beds
 
03:37:55.870 --> 03:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
but to overcome our addiction crisis we
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
need many
 
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
more there are currently no Certified
 
03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
Recovery houses in Rockingham County and
 
03:38:05.110 --> 03:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
none in Coos County there are only a
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
small handful of beds in Sullivan
 
03:38:11.269 --> 03:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
Grafton and in chesher counties even in
 
03:38:13.110 --> 03:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester which has the most beds in
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
the state there are not enough to meet
 
03:38:17.630 --> 03:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
the need according to Statewide
 
03:38:20.349 --> 03:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
projections there is not one community
 
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
in our state that has enough beds to
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of individuals with
 
03:38:27.510 --> 03:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorder and our state
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
would need an additional 15,000 beds to
 
03:38:33.670 --> 03:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
meet that need to be clear this bill
 
03:38:35.950 --> 03:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
will not solve the housing shortage but
 
03:38:37.269 --> 03:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
it will help by supporting the
 
03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
development of recovery housing around
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
the state often times when recovery
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
houses are proposed for development
 
03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
local zoning and planning boards don't
 
03:38:50.110 --> 03:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what they are and
 
03:38:52.229 --> 03:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
what to do with them this
 
03:38:55.750 --> 03:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill aims to remedy that by clarifying
 
03:38:58.309 --> 03:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
in state law that these are residential
 
03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
facilities to be zoned and regulated
 
03:39:03.030 --> 03:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
like other multi-unit residential
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
facilities as required by the federal
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
fair housing act this will help cities
 
03:39:10.150 --> 03:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
and towns to support the development of
 
03:39:13.630 --> 03:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
this key key resource and also help them
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
to avoid fair housing complaints
 
03:39:20.429 --> 03:39:20.439 align:start position:0%
also it will help our communities to
 
03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
ensure that they have the housing
 
03:39:24.710 --> 03:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
resources that they need to support
 
03:39:27.269 --> 03:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
individuals in their localities with
 
03:39:30.590 --> 03:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
recovery and help us all to overcome the
 
03:39:30.600 --> 03:39:32.590 align:start position:0%
recovery and help us all to overcome the
addiction

03:39:32.590 --> 03:39:32.600 align:start position:0%

03:39:37.790 --> 03:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
um I'd be happy to take questions uh I
 
03:39:39.550 --> 03:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
should should point out that there will
 
03:39:42.510 --> 03:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
be others testifying who may be better
 
03:39:45.910 --> 03:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
answer better able to answer
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%

03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Gibbs

representative

03:40:03.910 --> 03:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
Gerard thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the line 16 line 17 of your bill you
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
discuss about the per purpose of this
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph recovery house should be
 
03:40:17.550 --> 03:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
certified pursuant to the RSA within one
 
03:40:20.429 --> 03:40:20.439 align:start position:0%
year or I'm sorry I can't hear you can
 
03:40:24.070 --> 03:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
you a little okay I will try um the
 
03:40:26.349 --> 03:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
question I have is in regards to the
 
03:40:29.070 --> 03:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
certification process in speaking with a
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
gentleman who is very uh familiar with
 
03:40:35.229 --> 03:40:35.239 align:start position:0%
the the process at this point it sounds
 
03:40:38.070 --> 03:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
like one year is probably a a very long
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
period of time for this uh because the
 
03:40:43.550 --> 03:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
concern was that people come in and
 
03:40:45.630 --> 03:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
start to open up that are not really
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
doing it legitimately and then they
 
03:40:49.910 --> 03:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
could close up before the year's process
 
03:40:52.150 --> 03:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
and not ever have to worry about it is
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
there how would that be
 
03:40:57.429 --> 03:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
handled um there are others who are
 
03:40:59.309 --> 03:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
going to be testifying I think who can
 
03:41:02.229 --> 03:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
better answer that question than I can
 
03:41:04.710 --> 03:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh Jake Barry of of new Futures is going
 
03:41:06.790 --> 03:41:06.800 align:start position:0%

03:41:09.429 --> 03:41:09.439 align:start position:0%

great to be back um I used to sit in the
 
03:41:45.790 --> 03:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
seat where uh

03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%

with you I'm here to support HP
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
432 I represent the District of 17 in
 
03:42:04.229 --> 03:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
hillsbough County that is W two for the
 
03:42:05.670 --> 03:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
city of
 
03:42:09.229 --> 03:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I have many personal
 
03:42:14.229 --> 03:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
stories of of constituents in my war
 
03:42:16.469 --> 03:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
that has children and
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and relatives who have a
 
03:42:23.149 --> 03:42:23.159 align:start position:0%
substance abuse program and they go for
 
03:42:25.389 --> 03:42:25.399 align:start position:0%
treatment and the treatment can be a
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
month or two months and they leave the
 
03:42:31.910 --> 03:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities and there's no safe
 
03:42:34.510 --> 03:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
environment for them
 
03:42:39.389 --> 03:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
to for their next step and this is a
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
represents a way to
 
03:42:45.710 --> 03:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
clarify recovery
 
03:42:49.070 --> 03:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
houses and would assist the cities and
 
03:42:54.030 --> 03:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
towns to do so to encourage them to
 
03:42:58.269 --> 03:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
permit more recovery houses in their
 
03:43:00.429 --> 03:43:00.439 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and as was mentioned
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
before there is a substantial need for
 
03:43:08.590 --> 03:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
this in New Hampshire we only have 1,300
 
03:43:14.189 --> 03:43:14.199 align:start position:0%
beds currently and we need 15,000 beds
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
more to to accommodate those people who
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
are recovering from substance
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
abuse now I know this doesn't solve the
 
03:43:27.790 --> 03:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
housing crisis there is a committee to
 
03:43:31.670 --> 03:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
do that but this will address a
 
03:43:35.429 --> 03:43:35.439 align:start position:0%
significant obstacle that is facing all
 
03:43:36.550 --> 03:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
of our
 
03:43:39.149 --> 03:43:39.159 align:start position:0%
communities and the people within them
 
03:43:42.389 --> 03:43:42.399 align:start position:0%
that have substance abuse addiction
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
problems so I urge you to approve this
 
03:43:50.349 --> 03:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
bill um and I will answer any questions
 
03:43:53.950 --> 03:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
if I'm able to do so thank you questions
 
03:43:55.990 --> 03:43:56.000 align:start position:0%

03:44:07.950 --> 03:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
in the first line in this section
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
recovery house means
 
03:44:13.110 --> 03:44:13.120 align:start position:0%
primarily what is the
 
03:44:15.870 --> 03:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
word primarily
 
03:44:18.510 --> 03:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
opens the door to doesn't it open the
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
door to ambiguity about about the exact
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
definition so I'm curious why is the
 
03:44:25.750 --> 03:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
word primarily there do you know that's
 
03:44:29.070 --> 03:44:29.080 align:start position:0%

um I am a retired registered dietitian
 
03:45:26.229 --> 03:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
and now some 30 plus years ago I worked
 
03:45:28.950 --> 03:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
for about 10 years in what was then
 
03:45:31.590 --> 03:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
called addiction treatment um and
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
provided care to people in three
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
different substance use
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
disorder uh early recovery
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
facilities and learned a whole whole lot
 
03:45:42.750 --> 03:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
then about the reality that folks with
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder are just like all
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%

this building with substance use
 
03:45:50.670 --> 03:45:50.680 align:start position:0%

people who need help to get in and stay
 
03:45:56.349 --> 03:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
recovered and be productive members of
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
society I'm a co-sponsor on this bill
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
and I vigorously support it the key
 
03:46:03.910 --> 03:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
points I would remind folks of recovery
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
houses are not medical facilities the
 
03:46:09.189 --> 03:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
people who reside in recovery houses
 
03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
have already achieved recovery and they
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
are working hard to stay in recovery
 
03:46:20.389 --> 03:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
the houses are to create a safe
 
03:46:23.070 --> 03:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
supportive substance-free environment
 
03:46:27.070 --> 03:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
from which people can live work parent
 
03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
do all the things that ordinary people
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
do in life and develop more skills and
 
03:46:34.870 --> 03:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
more time
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
frame as people in recovery so that that
 
03:46:39.630 --> 03:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
becomes their norm and they
 
03:46:39.640 --> 03:46:42.030 align:start position:0%
becomes their norm and they
work

03:46:42.030 --> 03:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and just being concise here I would
 
03:46:46.830 --> 03:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
just say people often do better when
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
they are in a in the broader oops
 
03:46:52.349 --> 03:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
broader Community sense familiar
 
03:46:54.149 --> 03:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
environment where they have support
 
03:46:56.070 --> 03:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
systems outside of the recovery home
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's family
 
03:47:01.590 --> 03:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
friends um groups that they participate
 
03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
in and if you can't find a safe Recovery
 
03:47:06.269 --> 03:47:06.279 align:start position:0%
House in your community and you have to
 
03:47:08.429 --> 03:47:08.439 align:start position:0%
go far away that can compromise your
 
03:47:10.389 --> 03:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
recovery that's not true of every
 
03:47:13.469 --> 03:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
individual but it is often true um I
 
03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
think they are very very good for
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
community and I urge you to take this
 
03:47:22.149 --> 03:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
thoughtfully and seriously thank you
 
03:47:24.269 --> 03:47:24.279 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions the chair
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%

03:47:29.950 --> 03:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you Madame chairman welcome
 
03:47:34.149 --> 03:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative Damon um who assures
 
03:47:36.950 --> 03:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis that the
 
03:47:40.750 --> 03:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
individuals are substance
 
03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
free that is an excellent question and I
 
03:47:45.710 --> 03:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
am going to defer to the f FKS behind me
 
03:47:46.750 --> 03:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
who are
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:53.469 --> 03:47:53.479 align:start position:0%
operations the chair recognizes
 
03:47:55.870 --> 03:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you madam
 
03:47:57.269 --> 03:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and thank you representative
 
03:48:00.309 --> 03:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you said U these
 
03:48:03.309 --> 03:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
are not uh medical facilities correct
 
03:48:09.070 --> 03:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:12.309 --> 03:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
business um I'm not fully qualified to
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
that answer that question but my
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
response would be they're not usually
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
for-profit okay so I think it would be
 
03:48:25.229 --> 03:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
how what their tax uh category is and
 
03:48:26.710 --> 03:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it's not all the
 
03:48:30.429 --> 03:48:30.439 align:start position:0%
same um further questions the chair
 
03:48:33.349 --> 03:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
recognizes Vice chairman
 
03:48:36.389 --> 03:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
McDonald good afternoon representative
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
um on line three you've got dwelling a
 
03:48:42.670 --> 03:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit that provides a and you've
 
03:48:45.309 --> 03:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
crossed out safe and healthy why did you
 
03:48:45.319 --> 03:48:49.750 align:start position:0%
crossed out safe and healthy why did you
do

03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.550 --> 03:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
that I am not the person who drafted the
 
03:48:56.389 --> 03:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
bill but my opinion would be that those
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
are terms that are somewhat vague and
 
03:49:02.229 --> 03:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
hard to Define versus substance free is
 
03:49:04.590 --> 03:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
a very clear
 
03:49:07.630 --> 03:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
statement okay thank you you're welcome
 
03:49:10.110 --> 03:49:10.120 align:start position:0%

chair thank you representative Damon for
 
03:49:19.870 --> 03:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
coming before us uh you may not be the
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
person to most qualify to answer my
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
question um typically do the people in
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
the transitional house pay rent out of
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
their own pockets is it funded by
 
03:49:40.110 --> 03:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or some other funding means can
 
03:49:43.750 --> 03:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to defer the details of
 
03:49:45.910 --> 03:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
that answer I don't it's the same for
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
every recovery house um I personally am
 
03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
not aware of there being Medicaid
 
03:49:53.710 --> 03:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
funding for it but I would encourage it
 
03:49:56.830 --> 03:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
ask that question to the folks behind
 
03:49:59.550 --> 03:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
me and I apologize for not having all
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
the answers I'm on Ed funding committee
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%

03:50:07.710 --> 03:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:50:11.550 --> 03:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question course if um
 
03:50:15.510 --> 03:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
a medical facility wanted to build
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
build a Recovery House on its tax exempt
 
03:50:22.590 --> 03:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
property within a
 
03:50:25.469 --> 03:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
municipality would that fa facility also
 
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
be tax
 
03:50:31.510 --> 03:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:35.309 --> 03:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:40.189 --> 03:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:42.990 --> 03:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%

next the chair calls Mr Joe Scully and
 
03:51:01.149 --> 03:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.630 --> 03:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
Sims welcome to Municipal and County
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
government thank you madam chair and
 
03:51:08.189 --> 03:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
members of the municipal committee my
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
name is Joe Scully I live here in
 
03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
conquer less than a quarter mile down
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
the road um want to say first that I do
 
03:51:19.510 --> 03:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
not uh oppose sober living houses I
 
03:51:21.469 --> 03:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
think they are a great thing when the
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
proper structure is in place and I I
 
03:51:25.630 --> 03:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
trust that everyone here behind me to
 
03:51:27.990 --> 03:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
speak in support of it uh does provide
 
03:51:30.990 --> 03:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
the the proper structure and has been uh
 
03:51:33.830 --> 03:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
recipient perhaps of of good structure
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
my concern is for the Bad actors out
 
03:51:39.189 --> 03:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
there um and I have a personal
 
03:51:42.030 --> 03:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
experience with this done some research
 
03:51:43.710 --> 03:51:43.720 align:start position:0%
and found that I believe there are a lot
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
of uh people people who are abusing the
 
03:51:48.670 --> 03:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
system taking taking advantage of
 
03:51:50.790 --> 03:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
everybody including people who live in
 
03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
the so the sober living houses and the
 
03:51:55.590 --> 03:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods around them the reason
 
03:51:57.229 --> 03:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
that can happen is there are essentially
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
no rules right now in New Hampshire as
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell I got involved in this
 
03:52:04.349 --> 03:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
this past summer when I got a legal
 
03:52:06.910 --> 03:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
notice from the conquered Zoning Board
 
03:52:06.920 --> 03:52:07.870 align:start position:0%
notice from the conquered Zoning Board
of

03:52:07.870 --> 03:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:52:12.510 --> 03:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
adjustment uh a a property owner and I
 
03:52:16.229 --> 03:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
passed out uh momentum properties um was
 
03:52:19.590 --> 03:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
petitioning for a an exception from
 
03:52:19.600 --> 03:52:20.910 align:start position:0%
petitioning for a an exception from
zoning

03:52:20.910 --> 03:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
03:52:23.790 --> 03:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
regulations uh they clearly were already
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
doing this they were petitioning for
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
something that they were already doing
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
they got caught uh my neighbors and I
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
all came out gave some concerns
 
03:52:35.710 --> 03:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
including the uh uptake in police
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
activity that you can see on the police
 
03:52:39.870 --> 03:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
log since they bought the house there
 
03:52:42.429 --> 03:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
was there were no calls to that property
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
in the 10 years prior to them buying the
 
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
house as soon as they bought it there's
 
03:52:49.149 --> 03:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
calls for uh criminal threatening I was
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
criminally threatened I I potentially by
 
03:52:55.149 --> 03:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
the that very incident in there uh guy
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
came uh onto my property as I was trying
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
to get my four-year-old daughter into
 
03:53:01.550 --> 03:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
the car and and uh he was he was on
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
drugs and trying to fight me in my own
 
03:53:03.960 --> 03:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
drugs and trying to fight me in my own
yard

03:53:05.910 --> 03:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
yard
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
um there my my one neighbor spoke of uh
 
03:53:11.110 --> 03:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
one of the people living in that house
 
03:53:15.070 --> 03:53:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh sexually satisfying himself uh with
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
the windows open looking looking into
 
03:53:20.349 --> 03:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
the other house next door
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
um the property owner sent his lawyer
 
03:53:25.590 --> 03:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
who threatened the zoning board and said
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
if you don't Grant this special
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
exception we're going to sue you in
 
03:53:30.429 --> 03:53:30.439 align:start position:0%
federal court for violations of
 
03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
Americans with Disabilities Act uh so
 
03:53:35.389 --> 03:53:35.399 align:start position:0%
the board uh following that granted it
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
he said we'll sue you just like we sued
 
03:53:39.229 --> 03:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
Manchester and federal court uh some of
 
03:53:41.149 --> 03:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
the other research which I I only have
 
03:53:42.750 --> 03:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
one copy of I'm I'm happy to leave
 
03:53:45.389 --> 03:53:45.399 align:start position:0%
everything I I have here uh so the
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee can can have it but we found
 
03:53:50.790 --> 03:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
this particular company bought four
 
03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
houses and conquered all in that same
 
03:53:56.149 --> 03:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
day from the same previous owners so
 
03:53:58.229 --> 03:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
while I have not been able to verify if
 
03:54:01.070 --> 03:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
the other three houses are sober living
 
03:54:03.429 --> 03:54:03.439 align:start position:0%
houses or not I I suspect that they are
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
the company was formed like a month
 
03:54:08.990 --> 03:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
before they bought all these four houses
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
um I found I'm sorry please let me know
 
03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
if I'm running up against my time um
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement as far as I can
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
tell that sober living house residents
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
have to prove that they either have
 
03:54:23.950 --> 03:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
received addiction treatment or have
 
03:54:26.429 --> 03:54:26.439 align:start position:0%
recently received addiction treatment
 
03:54:28.870 --> 03:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not require that paid
 
03:54:31.710 --> 03:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
house managers live at recovery houses
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
or sober living houses as far as I can
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
tell um you know I've got uh Union
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
Leader article from back in September a
 
03:54:43.149 --> 03:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester property owner is saying that
 
03:54:45.550 --> 03:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
he needs to be able to put 10 occupants
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
in a house only zoned for four in order
 
03:54:51.870 --> 03:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
to be able to make enough money uh Nash
 
03:54:54.070 --> 03:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
nasua is being sued in federal court by
 
03:54:58.349 --> 03:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
a Rhode Island based attorney um I I'll
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
wrap up here but my point is that um
 
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
there are almost no rules here and
 
03:55:07.630 --> 03:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
that's allowing the Bad actors to take
 
03:55:09.550 --> 03:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
advantage of everybody there are these
 
03:55:10.950 --> 03:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
they call these things sober living
 
03:55:13.550 --> 03:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
houses but I I I think I've got some
 
03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
evidence to show that it it's a place
 
03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
where drugs can and do um come in
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
because there's there's no structure so
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
taking away something um the zoning uh
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
process so to speak that currently
 
03:55:33.550 --> 03:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
exists I feel would only worsen the
 
03:55:35.870 --> 03:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
abuse of the system by The Bad actors
 
03:55:37.229 --> 03:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
out there so I want to respect
 
03:55:39.870 --> 03:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
everyone's time um I can stop there
 
03:55:39.880 --> 03:55:40.750 align:start position:0%
everyone's time um I can stop there
thank

03:55:40.750 --> 03:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:55:45.189 --> 03:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you other questions

representative
 
03:55:48.750 --> 03:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:55:50.790 --> 03:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you for
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
testifying before our committee would
 
03:55:55.830 --> 03:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
you agree that so-called Bad actors and
 
03:55:58.990 --> 03:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
people who abuse drugs could live in not
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
facilities unlike this one residential
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
facilities homes could could they live
 
03:56:08.429 --> 03:56:08.439 align:start position:0%
in res uh yes in fact they they do
 
03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening in my
 
03:56:11.670 --> 03:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood two two houses down and two
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
houses over um that is a single family
 
03:56:17.389 --> 03:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
house zoned for four people that they
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
now have approval for six people one
 
03:56:26.030 --> 03:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
bathroom um I I just uh struggle to see
 
03:56:28.950 --> 03:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
how that is really um a good situation
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
for the people in there and I I just
 
03:56:33.910 --> 03:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
view it as that property
 
03:56:36.550 --> 03:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
owner focusing on being able to collect
 
03:56:39.269 --> 03:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
more money from six people instead of
 
03:56:43.110 --> 03:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
four or less in there followup yes Madam
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
chair so my my question is
 
03:56:50.550 --> 03:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
that people who abuse substances and act
 
03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
badly maybe as a consequence of that
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
abuse can can and do live
 
03:57:01.389 --> 03:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
everywhere would you agree with that uh
 
03:57:04.870 --> 03:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
sure and and don't get me wrong I'm I'm
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm very sympathetic to to people who
 
03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
have been affected by um addiction and
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
my comments are grounded and I don't
 
03:57:19.070 --> 03:57:19.080 align:start position:0%
want to make it worse for them if if
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
sense representative Elward has a
 
03:57:26.469 --> 03:57:26.479 align:start position:0%

National
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
standards do you do you know what
 
03:57:57.149 --> 03:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
national standards exist for the
 
03:58:00.990 --> 03:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
certification process I can't say I am
 
03:58:03.630 --> 03:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with all of the standards to
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
become certified now all right thank
 
03:58:10.590 --> 03:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
you further
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
questions I have a question sure so I I
 
03:58:18.269 --> 03:58:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:23.389 --> 03:58:23.399 align:start position:0%
State a statement with regards to um
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
zoning a house being zoned for four
 
03:58:29.469 --> 03:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
people and more than four people um
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
residing in that particular house that
 
03:58:34.910 --> 03:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
was zoned for four could you expound
 
03:58:36.950 --> 03:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
upon that and clarify that and I assume
 
03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
that that is in the city of conquer do
 
03:58:42.710 --> 03:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
you have more detail to to what that's
 
03:58:44.950 --> 03:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
about um
 
03:58:48.149 --> 03:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
I I I don't have it with me I I can dig
 
03:58:50.950 --> 03:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
up the documents that were out there
 
03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
during the zoning process but yeah
 
03:58:56.870 --> 03:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
basically there was a statement uh
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
that this is a single family house not a
 
03:59:03.950 --> 03:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
not a duplex just one unit that
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
without a waiver or an
 
03:59:10.429 --> 03:59:10.439 align:start position:0%
exception four it was four people could
 
03:59:12.990 --> 03:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
live there and in order to exceed that
 
03:59:15.189 --> 03:59:15.199 align:start position:0%
as a non-family unit they needed an
 
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:17.800 align:start position:0%
exception and they petitioned they
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
petitioned for six while sort of uh
 
03:59:23.790 --> 03:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
portraying that as as they were doing us
 
03:59:25.990 --> 03:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
a favor the law gives us the ability to
 
03:59:27.910 --> 03:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
ask for 10 they said but we're only
 
03:59:30.030 --> 03:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
asking for six was was what was put out
 
03:59:33.070 --> 03:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
time would you be able to obtain that
 
03:59:38.149 --> 03:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
that reference and email it to me if if
 
03:59:40.389 --> 03:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
you can uh yes I will thank you thank
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
you any further questions seeing none
 
03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:54.429 --> 03:59:54.439 align:start position:0%
Scully next the chair calls M Melinda
 
03:59:57.790 --> 03:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
Sims then it will be followed by
 
04:00:17.229 --> 04:00:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.030 --> 04:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
you are correct it is my error somehow
 
04:00:24.630 --> 04:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
your pink card got in this stack so no I
 
04:00:29.189 --> 04:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
I apologize so then next the chair calls
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
I believe it is M Mr Connor nurel is
 
04:00:32.399 --> 04:00:35.149 align:start position:0%
I believe it is M Mr Connor nurel is
that

04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
correct and then that he'll be followed
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:43.309 --> 04:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
Dees welcome to Municipal and County
 
04:00:46.349 --> 04:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
Government thank you happy to be here so
 
04:00:49.149 --> 04:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
uh this is a a testimonial of my
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
experiences in sober living uh for
 
04:00:54.590 --> 04:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
myself uh arguably sober living was the
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
most crucial point in my recovery
 
04:00:58.590 --> 04:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
process I am just about to celebrate
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
three years clean on February 14th
 
04:01:03.510 --> 04:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
because of it and uh I came all the way
 
04:01:05.429 --> 04:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
up here from New York because uh the
 
04:01:07.309 --> 04:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
area that I'm from in New York didn't
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
have the resources for sober living and
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
as mentioned before there's counties out
 
04:01:15.469 --> 04:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
here here in New Hampshire that don't
 
04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
have the uh footprint for sober living
 
04:01:20.670 --> 04:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
like nashille and Manchester do so I
 
04:01:23.309 --> 04:01:23.319 align:start position:0%
work in treatment now and I see the
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
people that are able to stay in sober
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
living have the most success but there
 
04:01:28.710 --> 04:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
are are also the individuals that don't
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to stay in the uh
 
04:01:33.590 --> 04:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
areas that they got clean in they get
 
04:01:35.590 --> 04:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
pulled back to these counties because
 
04:01:38.149 --> 04:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
they have an IOP dictated through uh
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
drug court or whatever the case may be
 
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
they get pulled back to areas that they
 
04:01:44.550 --> 04:01:44.560 align:start position:0%
used in and they have no safe ha
 
04:01:47.389 --> 04:01:47.399 align:start position:0%
as far as sober living to live in so if
 
04:01:50.349 --> 04:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
there's a process to speed up uh sober
 
04:01:53.110 --> 04:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
living houses being put into those areas
 
04:01:56.830 --> 04:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
and I fully support it and uh will do
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
speak or say or do whatever it takes to
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
happen thank you sir are you willing to
 
04:02:07.030 --> 04:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
take questions I am
 
04:02:09.149 --> 04:02:09.159 align:start position:0%

questions the chair recognizes
representative

04:02:10.349 --> 04:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:02:13.229 --> 04:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you madam chairman welcome
 
04:02:17.149 --> 04:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire thank you
 
04:02:20.750 --> 04:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
um do you happen to know approximately
 
04:02:24.910 --> 04:02:24.920 align:start position:0%
what percent of individuals using this
 
04:02:28.910 --> 04:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
um let's call it sober living process um
 
04:02:28.920 --> 04:02:30.229 align:start position:0%
um let's call it sober living process um
are

04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:02:32.670 --> 04:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
successful so I don't know the exact
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
percentage but what I can say is there
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
the percentage always increases so
 
04:02:39.309 --> 04:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
there's a a detox residential than a
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
phpop like step of care that they go
 
04:02:43.469 --> 04:02:43.479 align:start position:0%
through and the percentage obviously
 
04:02:45.149 --> 04:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
increased inrees with every little bit
 
04:02:48.550 --> 04:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
that they do more towards their recovery
 
04:02:51.910 --> 04:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
um anyone that's searching for long-term
 
04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
recovery should always go to sober
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
living because everybody will benefit
 
04:02:57.550 --> 04:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
from it that's where you create your
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
connection your community and you create
 
04:03:02.469 --> 04:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
a foothold in your journey to long-term
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
recovery like I live in sober living
 
04:03:06.910 --> 04:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
still I've created my own little Network
 
04:03:08.429 --> 04:03:08.439 align:start position:0%
that we move to our own house we all
 
04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
live together house to house and kept
 
04:03:13.309 --> 04:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
upgrading ourselves along the way but we
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
still stay together throughout the whole
 
04:03:17.110 --> 04:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
thing I would have never got that if I
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
didn't go to sober living or continued
 
04:03:20.990 --> 04:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
with my after care now to take these
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to have addicts on the
 
04:03:24.309 --> 04:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
streets doing what addicts do best
 
04:03:26.750 --> 04:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
making the other people uncomfortable
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
all right but if you can allocate the
 
04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
houses to get them into and whatever
 
04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
areas it is you're giving the community
 
04:03:34.510 --> 04:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
a better chance to thrive you're getting
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
people off the street you're getting
 
04:03:37.870 --> 04:03:37.880 align:start position:0%
addicts help long-term help because
 
04:03:37.880 --> 04:03:38.990 align:start position:0%
addicts help long-term help because
treatment

04:03:38.990 --> 04:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
ends there has to be more sober living
 
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.720 --> 04:03:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:03:53.670 --> 04:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:03:54.790 --> 04:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
you for testifying today and
 
04:03:56.110 --> 04:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
congratulations on your threee of
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
sobriety that's awesome um could you
 
04:04:00.030 --> 04:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
describe just briefly because some of
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
the the one of the questions came up but
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
what it might look like inside a sober
 
04:04:06.670 --> 04:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
house supervision wise and what kind of
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
supports do you
 
04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
receive so I I did hear that there is no
 
04:04:14.349 --> 04:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
law to make sober living have a Livin
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
house manager that kind of thing but I
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
all the ones I know about in New
 
04:04:20.309 --> 04:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have house managers they don't
 
04:04:21.710 --> 04:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
just allow people to come off the street
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
and go into sober living either there's
 
04:04:26.149 --> 04:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
there's a a step there's a guide to
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
things as somebody that would uh
 
04:04:29.830 --> 04:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
potentially own a sober house I don't
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
want somebody that's that far uh that
 
04:04:35.309 --> 04:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
deep into the streets or into their
 
04:04:36.750 --> 04:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
addiction to move into sober living
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
because you don't have a good client at
 
04:04:38.279 --> 04:04:39.510 align:start position:0%
because you don't have a good client at
that

04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
point our sober living has house
 
04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
managers they have regular drug tests
 
04:04:46.269 --> 04:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
they could be sporadic or at least three
 
04:04:48.910 --> 04:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
times a week on any given day all right
 
04:04:50.349 --> 04:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
um they have recovery coaches for
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
everybody under a year that they get to
 
04:04:55.670 --> 04:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
see once a week and uh we have uh
 
04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
meetings that they go to that we hold
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
in-house at our facility plus around the
 
04:05:01.510 --> 04:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
surrounding area in Nashua I mean
 
04:05:02.990 --> 04:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
they're very ingrained in the community
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
out there they're not just there on
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:13.830 --> 04:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.429 --> 04:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.429 --> 04:05:24.439 align:start position:0%

Le we we'll sort that
 
04:05:39.790 --> 04:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
out uh thank you madam chairwoman and
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for uh taking
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
my testimony today my name is bro Des
 
04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
I represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:05:49.269 --> 04:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
Association we are a nonpartisan
 
04:05:51.389 --> 04:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
nonprofit voluntary membership
 
04:05:53.790 --> 04:05:53.800 align:start position:0%
organization um every city municipality
 
04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
all 234 are members of the New Hampshire
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and um I am
 
04:06:02.830 --> 04:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
speaking today to House Bill 432 and
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
registering our opposition and our
 
04:06:07.229 --> 04:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
opposition is doesn't really have
 
04:06:08.910 --> 04:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
anything to do with section one of the
 
04:06:10.389 --> 04:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
bill has to do with section two because
 
04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
our organization has historically and
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
always been against zoning mandates and
 
04:06:18.030 --> 04:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
um there are some aspects to the changes
 
04:06:22.550 --> 04:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
of um the of RSA 674 colon 17 um which
 
04:06:25.229 --> 04:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
is the purposes for zoning ordinances
 
04:06:28.870 --> 04:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
that by allowing um Recovery House
 
04:06:30.910 --> 04:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
however it's defined um that's not
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
really in our wheelhouse defining
 
04:06:34.389 --> 04:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
recovery houses but how are recovery
 
04:06:36.429 --> 04:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
houses defined um there'd be certain
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
exemptions that recovery houses would
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
have that could pose um safety and
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
health concerns to municipal ities and
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
cities and they have an interest in
 
04:06:48.189 --> 04:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
protecting um the safety and the health
 
04:06:50.550 --> 04:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
of their residents and um and folks who
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
live in their communities um first I'll
 
04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
touch on the um the definition of
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
recovery house and we had an internal
 
04:07:00.149 --> 04:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
conversation we had um one of our legal
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
council kind of review um some of the
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
statute and it seemed at least from our
 
04:07:08.070 --> 04:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
perspective that recovery homes while
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're not like boarding houses or
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
rooming houses or halfway house which is
 
04:07:14.750 --> 04:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know mentioned um later on and and
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
and uh described and defined I believe
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
in RSA 151 but um recovery houses still
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
are transient in nature they have
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
transient qualities that's what I should
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
say um they're not intended to be
 
04:07:29.229 --> 04:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
long-term living for the rest of your
 
04:07:31.710 --> 04:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
life they are intended to provide
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
housing stability to people who are
 
04:07:36.269 --> 04:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
recovering from drug addiction um which
 
04:07:37.790 --> 04:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
we understand there's a need for that in
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
our state but um just by changing the
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
definition removing the term safe
 
04:07:45.269 --> 04:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
healthy and family like is concerning
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
when coupled with the second section the
 
04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
um on line
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
12 is it line 12 I want to make sure I
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
get it right yes on line 12 it says you
 
04:08:01.109 --> 04:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
know after describing you know multif
 
04:08:02.950 --> 04:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
family respectively and shall not be
 
04:08:04.429 --> 04:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
subject to permitting or approval
 
04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
processes out a zoning ordinance or
 
04:08:07.630 --> 04:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
other land use regulation adopted under
 
04:08:10.389 --> 04:08:10.399 align:start position:0%
this title does not similarly require of
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
such uses and we're worried that that
 
04:08:14.309 --> 04:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
might mean that considering the health
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
and general welfare of a community in
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
zoning um would not be allowed to be
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
considered and even more um after that
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
on line 14 um the First full sentence
 
04:08:26.349 --> 04:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
use of existing multif family structure
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
as a recovery house and no not that no
 
04:08:31.750 --> 04:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah shall not require site plan review
 
04:08:33.790 --> 04:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
um site plan review is a very important
 
04:08:37.510 --> 04:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
process for ensuring that um that the uh
 
04:08:40.349 --> 04:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
change of use that that is conforming to
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
um some of the zoning regulations which
 
04:08:44.109 --> 04:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
have to do with health and safety
 
04:08:45.790 --> 04:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
um so without that there's really
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
nothing for a municipality to be able to
 
04:08:48.670 --> 04:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's health and safety
 
04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
requirements or a myriad of other zoning
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
requirements that every other type of um
 
04:08:54.429 --> 04:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
commercial or Residential Building would
 
04:08:57.229 --> 04:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
be subjected to if it did not conform to
 
04:08:59.070 --> 04:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
the uh zoning of the community the
 
04:09:01.950 --> 04:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
zoning and the planning um the
 
04:09:03.309 --> 04:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
permitting process is somewhat of a
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
concern too you'll see on um line uh 16
 
04:09:10.510 --> 04:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
um it says or shall be actively pursuing
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
certification achieve certification with
 
04:09:14.429 --> 04:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
the one Within one year of beginning
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
operations so um they wouldn't be
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
required to even have a certification to
 
04:09:21.510 --> 04:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
operate um and they could even have up
 
04:09:23.109 --> 04:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
to one year to get that certification
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
and most municipalities and cities are
 
04:09:26.429 --> 04:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
going to want them to be certified to be
 
04:09:28.269 --> 04:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
able to operate a Recovery House in
 
04:09:30.510 --> 04:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
their municipality um and that's part of
 
04:09:31.630 --> 04:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
the reason why it's good to have site
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
plan review because you're going to ask
 
04:09:34.870 --> 04:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
that during the site plan review uh
 
04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
possibly depending on what your local
 
04:09:37.710 --> 04:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
ordinances are and what your processes
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
for site plan review um I also want to
 
04:09:42.269 --> 04:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
mention CU I heard one person who talked
 
04:09:44.830 --> 04:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
about a um an application that came in
 
04:09:46.070 --> 04:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
front of either their planning or zoning
 
04:09:48.030 --> 04:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
board in the city of conquer and um
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
there is something to be said about
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
these local processes can be used not
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
just for Community feedback but also
 
04:09:55.670 --> 04:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
education right sometimes these folks
 
04:09:57.389 --> 04:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
that run these organizations are trying
 
04:09:59.790 --> 04:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
to change the use of a residential um
 
04:10:01.710 --> 04:10:01.720 align:start position:0%
property into a recovery house they can
 
04:10:04.510 --> 04:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
help provide education as to why they
 
04:10:06.670 --> 04:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
believe that um changing the use won't
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
create a health or general safety issue
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
in their neighborhood in the residential
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood where it's um being applied
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
for and
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I think I put on my card only 3
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
minutes so I'll I'll yield there and
 
04:10:20.630 --> 04:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions to the best of
 
04:10:20.640 --> 04:10:21.469 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions to the best of
my

04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:10:21.479 --> 04:10:23.389 align:start position:0%
my
ability

04:10:23.389 --> 04:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
ability
 
04:10:26.550 --> 04:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative stavis thank
 
04:10:28.030 --> 04:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
my question and as you know this is a
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
committee of nuts and bolts and details
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to focus on the the
 
04:10:37.550 --> 04:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
principle here I want to focus on one of
 
04:10:40.189 --> 04:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
those details and I'm struggling with
 
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
the term non-
 
04:10:45.510 --> 04:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
trangent which is in
 
04:10:47.790 --> 04:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
line two of the
 
04:10:53.309 --> 04:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
bill uh can you define for me under what
 
04:10:56.910 --> 04:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
RSA is this term located and what does
 
04:11:00.550 --> 04:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
it mean I what I'm struggling with is
 
04:11:03.309 --> 04:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
the taxation laws that
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
govern temporary housing coming under
 
04:11:11.070 --> 04:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
the business tax chapter and how
 
04:11:14.550 --> 04:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
non-rent fits or doesn't fit into that
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
category and and what does non-rent
 
04:11:21.149 --> 04:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
actually mean for purposes of
 
04:11:23.309 --> 04:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
Taxation that's a great question I would
 
04:11:24.750 --> 04:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
have to ask her Le it wasn't even
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
something that came up on our internal
 
04:11:28.510 --> 04:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
conversations about it um regarding that
 
04:11:30.750 --> 04:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
term non-transient I'm unaware if it's
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
in any other statutes there might be
 
04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
people that testify after me who know
 
04:11:36.710 --> 04:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
more about this um section of the RSA
 
04:11:39.710 --> 04:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
RSA chapter 153 cuz I mean it's a
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
Recovery House statute and there might
 
04:11:43.269 --> 04:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
be some sections of our planning in
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
zoning statutes that Define it and
 
04:11:46.750 --> 04:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
mention it but um or at least cite this
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
RSA but I'm not sure how it would be
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
treated under the tax law and usually
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
when something comes about what you know
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
how they would be assessed whether
 
04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
commercial or residential we would
 
04:11:58.109 --> 04:11:58.119 align:start position:0%
usually reach out to some assessors that
 
04:11:59.590 --> 04:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
we have close connections with the ask
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
them how you know what what what
 
04:12:05.429 --> 04:12:05.439 align:start position:0%
sections of RSA 72 the property tax uh
 
04:12:07.469 --> 04:12:07.479 align:start position:0%
statutes how would this be um
 
04:12:09.109 --> 04:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
interpreted how would you assess this
 
04:12:10.269 --> 04:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
property so we haven't had those
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
conversations but I can have those and
 
04:12:14.109 --> 04:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
follow up with you
 
04:12:14.119 --> 04:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
follow up with you
further

04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

House Bill 432 um I myself am in
 
04:12:54.670 --> 04:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
long-term recovery uh this past December
 
04:12:57.189 --> 04:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
I celebrated five years of continuous
 
04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
recovery um I'm going to talk a little
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
bit about my own experience within uh
 
04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
recovery and in sober living as well um
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
I don't own a sober house I don't have
 
04:13:10.070 --> 04:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
any operations and sober living um you
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
know I was a I've been dealing with
 
04:13:13.630 --> 04:13:13.640 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder
 
04:13:15.109 --> 04:13:15.119 align:start position:0%
and different various mental health
 
04:13:16.990 --> 04:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
disorders since I was probably about a
 
04:13:17.000 --> 04:13:18.550 align:start position:0%
disorders since I was probably about a
teenager

04:13:18.550 --> 04:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
teenager
 
04:13:21.469 --> 04:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
um multiple treatment centers um in and
 
04:13:23.189 --> 04:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
out of various incarcerations throughout
 
04:13:26.670 --> 04:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
my life um starting off as a child and I
 
04:13:28.670 --> 04:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
never once really felt like I belonged
 
04:13:30.630 --> 04:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere until I had reached sober
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
living um it was something that part of
 
04:13:34.870 --> 04:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
the process through my addiction I was
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
very hesitant towards because I always
 
04:13:38.349 --> 04:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to figure it out my own way and I
 
04:13:40.030 --> 04:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
also had a lot of issues with kind of
 
04:13:42.510 --> 04:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
complying and abiding by various rules
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
and boundaries that were set forth in
 
04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
front of me um in my time in sober
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
living um it is a very safe and
 
04:13:52.269 --> 04:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
structured environment um There are
 
04:13:54.910 --> 04:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
rules set forth in various you know I
 
04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
know it might sound
 
04:14:00.389 --> 04:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
um it might sound a little dumb if
 
04:14:01.950 --> 04:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
you've never had that these sort of
 
04:14:03.710 --> 04:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
learned life experiences but I never
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
really had any sort of structure in my
 
04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
life I never really had anyone you know
 
04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily like a guiding force saying
 
04:14:12.309 --> 04:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
like you know um what is good and what
 
04:14:13.630 --> 04:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
is not good for me
 
04:14:16.189 --> 04:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
um there I learned uh a lot about myself
 
04:14:18.149 --> 04:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
a lot about the addiction process and
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
was able to you know work myself through
 
04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
the recovery process and I went from
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
being a resident to a house manager um
 
04:14:28.469 --> 04:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
and from there I ended up becoming the
 
04:14:30.109 --> 04:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
operations director for a sober living
 
04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
community as well within the Manchester
 
04:14:35.149 --> 04:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
area um and after that I went on to help
 
04:14:36.710 --> 04:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
out with another house that had opened
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
up and helped you know come up with some
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
of the program rules and regulations and
 
04:14:43.590 --> 04:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
things like that and while I can say
 
04:14:45.830 --> 04:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
that there are Bad actors out there just
 
04:14:47.630 --> 04:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
as there are in any line of business or
 
04:14:50.189 --> 04:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
any you know facet of the world um
 
04:14:52.070 --> 04:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good eggs out there as
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
well and we just don't hear a lot about
 
04:14:55.309 --> 04:14:55.319 align:start position:0%
those because they don't sell the
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
newspapers and the headlines and things
 
04:14:58.910 --> 04:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
like that so we do hear about the bad
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
actors but it's all about the culture
 
04:15:02.910 --> 04:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
and the community that is built within
 
04:15:04.429 --> 04:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
these Sober Living homes and like that
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
was one thing that I really took a lot
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
of Pride on was the successes that
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
happened within the houses that I ran
 
04:15:13.109 --> 04:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
and operated um up until I had reached
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
into sober living uh that first you know
 
04:15:17.109 --> 04:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
sober living community that I was a part
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
of that was the longest tenure ship that
 
04:15:20.469 --> 04:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
I had ever had at any place of living
 
04:15:22.990 --> 04:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
since I was a child um I had been in and
 
04:15:25.189 --> 04:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
out of every single apartment which
 
04:15:27.429 --> 04:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
never worked out you know I I I was
 
04:15:29.429 --> 04:15:29.439 align:start position:0%
struggling with every single aspect of
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
being a grown adult um and through the
 
04:15:35.070 --> 04:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
boundaries that I had learned for myself
 
04:15:37.070 --> 04:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
and the accountability and the just the
 
04:15:38.830 --> 04:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
the level of community and home that I
 
04:15:40.990 --> 04:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
got with within the Sober Living
 
04:15:44.710 --> 04:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
Community um you know today I have a a
 
04:15:46.229 --> 04:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
pretty good career within the mental
 
04:15:47.870 --> 04:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
health and substance use disorder and
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know just sitting here in this in in
 
04:15:51.109 --> 04:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
this courtroom I've already gotten
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
someone into treatment sitting back
 
04:15:54.590 --> 04:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
there um it is something that I'm
 
04:15:56.750 --> 04:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
extremely passionate about and I'm I'm a
 
04:15:59.790 --> 04:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
huge um supporter of Sober Living homes
 
04:16:00.870 --> 04:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know I wish it's something that I
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
did for myself a long time ago and
 
04:16:04.429 --> 04:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good that comes from it
 
04:16:06.030 --> 04:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
and and again I I understand that
 
04:16:09.469 --> 04:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of concerns about um the
 
04:16:11.950 --> 04:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
the regulatory aspects of it but I think
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
we can all sit here and agree agree that
 
04:16:15.389 --> 04:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
we have a huge housing crisis as it is
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to those that are
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
affected with homelessness and substance
 
04:16:20.830 --> 04:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
use disorders that that that community
 
04:16:23.790 --> 04:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
of itself is by and large
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
very very tough to to find safe secure
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
housing and I think that the Sober
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
Living Community does a really good job
 
04:16:31.950 --> 04:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
and and again these success stories are
 
04:16:33.510 --> 04:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily something that we hear
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
about very often but they do happen um
 
04:16:37.870 --> 04:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
some of my best friends that I've met in
 
04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
my entire life I met as roommates in
 
04:16:43.109 --> 04:16:43.119 align:start position:0%
sober living that were clean safe secure
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
um houses um through the work that I put
 
04:16:50.429 --> 04:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
in through uh in sober living in
 
04:16:52.630 --> 04:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
the the boundaries that I learned and
 
04:16:54.030 --> 04:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
the things I learned about myself I'm
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
now a homeowner um I own a home in
 
04:16:57.830 --> 04:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester I have full custody of my
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%

the recovery community and that is 100%
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
due to my time that I spent in sober
 
04:17:07.590 --> 04:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
living in the people that were that were
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
able to offer that sort of housing for
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%

my time in within the Sober Living
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
Community I had moved to different homes
 
04:17:50.670 --> 04:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
within the program and that was solely
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that through my own
 
04:17:55.710 --> 04:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
recovery process I was able
 
04:17:59.630 --> 04:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
to um move within the community you know
 
04:18:02.269 --> 04:18:02.279 align:start position:0%
I started as a your regular resident
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
there and you know through my own
 
04:18:05.990 --> 04:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
accountability and recovery and helping
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
others I was able to move to a floor
 
04:18:09.389 --> 04:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
manager position that was available in
 
04:18:13.389 --> 04:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
one house because the ownership
 
04:18:18.229 --> 04:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
Madame chairman may I um clarify my
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
question okay so this is a general yes
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
yes you may but General comment to
 
04:18:26.189 --> 04:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
committee members is we're here to get
 
04:18:29.109 --> 04:18:29.119 align:start position:0%
information with regards to the change
 
04:18:34.030 --> 04:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
in the law not in particular about the
 
04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
um efficacy or how recovery houses um
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
benefit individuals we want to zero in
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
on on how this new language in front of
 
04:18:51.109 --> 04:18:51.119 align:start position:0%
us is going to um affect
 
04:18:54.910 --> 04:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
things so yes I'm speaking to the word
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
non-transient in in line one um
 
04:19:03.469 --> 04:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
two so this is primarily
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
non-transient dwelling or dwelling
 
04:19:07.119 --> 04:19:09.229 align:start position:0%
non-transient dwelling or dwelling
unit

04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
unit
 
04:19:13.590 --> 04:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
so approximately how long did you stay
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
at each of your recovery dwelling
 
04:19:19.950 --> 04:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
units I had spent 19 months total within
 
04:19:19.960 --> 04:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
units I had spent 19 months total within
sober

04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
sober
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
living through various moves
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
within within the program and moving up
 
04:19:30.830 --> 04:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
um you know opportunities for leadership
 
04:19:32.910 --> 04:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
positions I had moved from a different
 
04:19:34.830 --> 04:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
house to another house but in totality
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
it was about 19 months within the Sober
 
04:19:36.600 --> 04:19:37.710 align:start position:0%
it was about 19 months within the Sober
Living

04:19:37.710 --> 04:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
Living

Molton welcome to Municipal and County
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
government thank you very much for
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:14.870 --> 04:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I myself um have spent many years in
 
04:20:16.990 --> 04:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
sober living um I've actually been
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
engaged in sober living since August
 
04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
22nd of
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
2017 um much like the member who spoke
 
04:20:27.109 --> 04:20:27.119 align:start position:0%
before me um
 
04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's been the arguably the most
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
important part now if it had not been
 
04:20:34.109 --> 04:20:34.119 align:start position:0%
available to me I would more than likely
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
be back in central New Hampshire up to
 
04:20:38.950 --> 04:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
the same old no good that I was prior to
 
04:20:42.910 --> 04:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
2017 um which then exhausts funding
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
based off of me being incarcerated and
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers paying more money into that
 
04:20:50.109 --> 04:20:50.119 align:start position:0%
effect as well um but during my stay in
 
04:20:52.510 --> 04:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
long-term sober living I've been
 
04:20:56.349 --> 04:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
in three separate houses about two and a
 
04:21:00.189 --> 04:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
half years a piece um and just like the
 
04:21:02.750 --> 04:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
member before me I have been through my
 
04:21:05.109 --> 04:21:05.119 align:start position:0%
own recovery and and willingness to help
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
other people I've been moving up the
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
ladder and I now work for the operation
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
side of Rise Above sober living which is
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
one of the the larger over living groups
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
in in New England
 
04:21:20.550 --> 04:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
um and I've had the chance to watch us
 
04:21:23.469 --> 04:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
work very diligently with NH core and
 
04:21:25.469 --> 04:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
get our home standardized and and
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
certified very quickly um I have had the
 
04:21:29.710 --> 04:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to watch countless
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
individuals celebrate long-term sobriety
 
04:21:34.030 --> 04:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
as a direct result of the long-term care
 
04:21:35.710 --> 04:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
that rise above and other sober living
 
04:21:40.229 --> 04:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
alms have provided in the state um and
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I agree with everything
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
that was said before me I don't want to
 
04:21:45.109 --> 04:21:45.119 align:start position:0%
repeat everything that they have said so
 
04:21:47.469 --> 04:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
I will take questions if there are
 
04:21:47.479 --> 04:21:50.670 align:start position:0%
I will take questions if there are
any

04:21:50.670 --> 04:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.710 --> 04:21:55.720 align:start position:0%

Place Recovery housing operators in an

unfortunate position without clear
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%

04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
complex series of local interpretations
 
04:23:05.469 --> 04:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
that vary by
 
04:23:07.510 --> 04:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
municipality some towns classify
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
recovery homes as boarding houses
 
04:23:11.149 --> 04:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
requiring costly modifications like
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%

04:23:15.269 --> 04:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
restrictive permitting processes that
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
effectively limit recovery homes to
 
04:23:19.750 --> 04:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
historically underserved areas this
 
04:23:21.309 --> 04:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory uncertainty creates
 
04:23:23.149 --> 04:23:23.159 align:start position:0%

regulatory barriers don't just impact
 
04:23:33.189 --> 04:23:33.199 align:start position:0%

choices for people seeking recovery
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
right now people seeking recovery face a
 
04:23:38.990 --> 04:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
tough choice they can stay near their
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
families and support systems without
 
04:23:43.030 --> 04:23:43.040 align:start position:0%

of the few areas they exist this this
 
04:23:49.469 --> 04:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
hits women particularly hard in the

entire northern half of our state
 
04:23:53.469 --> 04:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
everything north of Laconia there are
 
04:23:56.870 --> 04:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
only eight beds available for
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
women eight beds to serve half our state
 
04:24:01.950 --> 04:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
these are mothers who can't get help
 
04:24:04.269 --> 04:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
near their kids women who have to choose
 
04:24:05.910 --> 04:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
between recovery and keeping their
 
04:24:08.469 --> 04:24:08.479 align:start position:0%

04:24:10.950 --> 04:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
charitable Foundation research from 2017
 
04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
suggests that substance use disorder
 
04:24:15.030 --> 04:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
cost New Hampshire an estimated $ 2.36
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
billion every year even if we cut that
 
04:24:20.389 --> 04:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
number in half it's still far too much
 
04:24:22.590 --> 04:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
that breaks down to over $1,700 per
 
04:24:25.070 --> 04:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
resident we're losing roughly 12,000
 
04:24:26.990 --> 04:24:27.000 align:start position:0%

economy each day we wait to fix this it
 
04:24:36.429 --> 04:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
costs us $6.5 million money we could be
 
04:24:38.070 --> 04:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
saving through expanded access to
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
recovery housing right now New Hampshire
 
04:24:43.389 --> 04:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
has just over, 1300 recover home beds
 
04:24:45.710 --> 04:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
using a conservative estimate of 80%
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
capacity that's roughly 1,6 people in uh
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
1,46 people in recovery housing at any
 
04:24:54.030 --> 04:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
given time samsa data suggests roughly
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
107,000 New Hampshire residents struggle
 
04:24:58.149 --> 04:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
with addiction in our state the economic
 
04:24:59.870 --> 04:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
impact of untreated substance use
 
04:25:02.510 --> 04:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
disorder averages about 22,000 annually
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
per person affected remember that samsa
 
04:25:07.309 --> 04:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
data was pre-co so these numbers are
 
04:25:09.389 --> 04:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
likely higher now this means our current
 
04:25:11.070 --> 04:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
Recovery Home save New Hampshire over
 
04:25:14.189 --> 04:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
$23 million annually even at this cons
 
04:25:14.199 --> 04:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
$23 million annually even at this cons
conservative

04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
capacity and when we factor in the cost
 
04:25:19.830 --> 04:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
of incarceration and recidivism with
 
04:25:22.429 --> 04:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
only with over 41% of individuals
 
04:25:24.590 --> 04:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
returning to prison within 3 years the
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
savings multiply nearly half of these
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
returns happen in the first year alone
 
04:25:31.630 --> 04:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
recovery housing directly addresses this
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
by providing stable supportive
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
environments that reduce interactions
 
04:25:37.630 --> 04:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
with criminal justice system that's just
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
scratching the surface of what's
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
possible we have the model proof that it
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
works and we know that for every
 
04:25:43.950 --> 04:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
invested in treatment and Recovery
 
04:25:46.389 --> 04:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
support we save our state about $3 in
 
04:25:48.349 --> 04:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
costs the
 
04:25:48.359 --> 04:25:52.590 align:start position:0%
costs the
research

04:25:52.590 --> 04:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:57.229 --> 04:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
um I I have more but I will uh make a
 
04:26:00.109 --> 04:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
quick point about the Bad actors this
 
04:26:00.119 --> 04:26:01.309 align:start position:0%
quick point about the Bad actors this
bill

04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:26:03.990 --> 04:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
specifically incentivizes people to get
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
certified this bill does not protect
 
04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
people who are not certified AKA Bad
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
actors so in a lot of ways this bill is
 
04:26:16.109 --> 04:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
supporting I I promise you ethically run
 
04:26:19.469 --> 04:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
recovery homeowners also do not like Bad
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
actors we do not want them a part of
 
04:26:24.510 --> 04:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
this we do not want this bill to protect
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
them we want those homes gone just as
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
much as the next
 
04:26:30.429 --> 04:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
person but there are far more good
 
04:26:32.269 --> 04:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
people out there who are doing really
 
04:26:33.670 --> 04:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
great things and they're helping a lot
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
of people I'm open to any questions and
 
04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
I also have the Nar standards if anybody
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
wants to look at them thank you
 
04:26:45.309 --> 04:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
Mr Molton you had indicated on your PIN
 
04:26:47.349 --> 04:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
card that you do have written testimony
 
04:26:49.750 --> 04:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
do you have that for distribution for
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
everybody I would be happy to hand this
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
out because I did not do you have one
 
04:26:56.429 --> 04:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
copy I do okay I'm sorry um I didn't
 
04:26:59.309 --> 04:26:59.319 align:start position:0%
realize that I would beine sort that out
 
04:27:01.630 --> 04:27:01.640 align:start position:0%

France thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:27:14.030 --> 04:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
you I just had a quick question about
 
04:27:17.309 --> 04:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
how long does the certification process
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
take uh it a a lot of times depends on
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
the homeowner there are some homeowners
 
04:27:24.510 --> 04:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
that get all their ducks in a row
 
04:27:27.030 --> 04:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
quickly they get it done quickly for
 
04:27:28.950 --> 04:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
instance my I was I was the first ever
 
04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
certified Nar home in the state of New
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it took me roughly three
 
04:27:35.469 --> 04:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
months and I have maintained
 
04:27:37.269 --> 04:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
certification which we have to renew
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
yearly every year since then that was in
 
04:27:42.750 --> 04:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
2020 thank you
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
but there are again homeowners who take
 
04:27:47.830 --> 04:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
a long time and that can pause the
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
process the chair recognizes
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
representative Elwood thank you madam
 
04:27:54.990 --> 04:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
chairman Welcome to our committee thank
 
04:27:58.990 --> 04:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
you it might be in your statistics but
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
did you say there was a 41% recidivism
 
04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
rate uh based on the doc data that I
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
looked up and I actually have it in my
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
phone I don't remember the exact year
 
04:28:12.630 --> 04:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
but it is the most recent recent data
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
that I found it suggested
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
41% followup Madam chairman yes you're
 
04:28:20.910 --> 04:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
saying that's from the Department of
 
04:28:23.910 --> 04:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
Corrections the do correct correct so
 
04:28:26.389 --> 04:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's it was specifically a doc
 
04:28:30.070 --> 04:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
study so this was
 
04:28:35.189 --> 04:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
41% of incarceration recidivism after
 
04:28:38.189 --> 04:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
three years returning back to
 
04:28:40.510 --> 04:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
prison and then it broke it down Year
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
bye percentages
 
04:28:45.830 --> 04:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
across each year I'd be happy to find
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
the link for you if anybody is

interested okay thank you absolutely
 
04:28:49.560 --> 04:28:50.469 align:start position:0%
interested okay thank you absolutely
further

04:28:50.469 --> 04:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:28:53.309 --> 04:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
questions representative majori thank
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman and thank you for
 
04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
being here and all that you do for our
 
04:28:58.269 --> 04:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
state um I'll keep coming back to this
 
04:28:59.550 --> 04:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm sure somebody's going to
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
have the answer but your perspective on
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
the word primarily sure in there is it
 
04:29:06.670 --> 04:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
is it a necessary word does it does it
 
04:29:08.670 --> 04:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
apply I'm trying to figure out why it's
 
04:29:10.469 --> 04:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
why we need that word can you read the
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
sentence for me specifically in this
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
section recovery house means primarily
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
non-transient dwelling or dwelling unit
 
04:29:23.510 --> 04:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
that provides so primarily non-transient
 
04:29:27.510 --> 04:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
dwelling or dwelling unit uh that would
 
04:29:29.550 --> 04:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
be a jake Barry question I did not write
 
04:29:31.510 --> 04:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
this what I can tell you though is I can
 
04:29:33.030 --> 04:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
answer some of the other questions
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
generally speaking people exist in a
 
04:29:39.229 --> 04:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
recovery home for about 7 to 12 months
 
04:29:41.790 --> 04:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
and that is there's obviously a spectrum
 
04:29:43.590 --> 04:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
there right there are some people that
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
come into a recovery home and that's not
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
a good fit for them and they go to
 
04:29:48.109 --> 04:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
another recovery home and maybe they're
 
04:29:50.990 --> 04:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
there for 8 months 9 months 12 months uh
 
04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
we also have levels in the recovery
 
04:29:55.630 --> 04:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
homes there's level four 3 2 1 so you
 
04:29:57.990 --> 04:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
have some organizations that have a true
 
04:30:00.510 --> 04:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
step down process throughout I have
 
04:30:02.349 --> 04:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
level one homes with individuals who
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
have been with me for two and a half
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
years and they have over two years of
 
04:30:08.189 --> 04:30:08.199 align:start position:0%
recovery and they don't want to go
 
04:30:10.269 --> 04:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
anywhere because they're in a congregate
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
living and they're with the people that
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
they know but in regards to why they
 
04:30:17.590 --> 04:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
specifically use that verbiage I cannot
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
answer the question to that I'm sorry
 
04:30:22.309 --> 04:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
yes further
 
04:30:25.389 --> 04:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none um Mr Molton if
 
04:30:27.349 --> 04:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
you would like there's copies of the
 
04:30:30.030 --> 04:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
bill over on the side table you want to
 
04:30:30.040 --> 04:30:31.469 align:start position:0%
bill over on the side table you want to
take

04:30:31.469 --> 04:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
one oh does anybody should I give the to
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
a representative kazinski and we'll get
 
04:30:43.710 --> 04:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.469 --> 04:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.109 --> 04:30:55.119 align:start position:0%

members of the
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee my name is anina Hansen I'm a
 
04:31:18.309 --> 04:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
resident of Jaffrey and I'm here today
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
asking you to vote in favor of HB
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
432 I'm a person in recovery from
 
04:31:26.469 --> 04:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
alcoholism and once upon a time I fell
 
04:31:27.790 --> 04:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
in love with another New Hampshire
 
04:31:29.790 --> 04:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
resident in recovery from both alcohol
 
04:31:32.550 --> 04:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
and heroin addiction Phil had sobered up
 
04:31:34.750 --> 04:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
in prison and when he was released he
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
knew he didn't stand a chance of staying
 
04:31:37.830 --> 04:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
clean without a safe and supportive
 
04:31:40.149 --> 04:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
place to live fortunately he found a bed
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
in a sober house when he needed it
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
it was such a life-saving measure for
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
him he went on to found two sober houses
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
of his own giving scores of people a
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
safe place to start again of course
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
recovery housing is not a magical
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
guarantee it's just the first step in a
 
04:31:57.109 --> 04:31:57.119 align:start position:0%
long journey over time Phil started a
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
business bought his own home even served
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
as a state rep he met me and we built a
 
04:32:05.229 --> 04:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
life together but then Co happened his
 
04:32:07.349 --> 04:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
mental health needs went untreated and
 
04:32:10.109 --> 04:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
at 5 years sober he relapsed and died of
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
a fentanyl overdose
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
until you've lost someone to overdose
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
you cannot fully understand the absolute
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
irredeemable futility of it it is a
 
04:32:23.870 --> 04:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
pointless and preventable death every
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
single person who dies of Overdose
 
04:32:28.109 --> 04:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's alcohol which is by far the
 
04:32:30.030 --> 04:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
leading cause here in New Hampshire or
 
04:32:32.750 --> 04:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or any other drug is someone
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
who with more time and more support
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
might have kicked their addiction and
 
04:32:39.950 --> 04:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
built a stable life this is why a safe
 
04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
environment for early recovery is Cru
 
04:32:44.229 --> 04:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
crucial whenever someone's substance
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
dependent makes the attempt to live
 
04:32:48.550 --> 04:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
substance-free the risk of relapse is
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
highest by far in the beginning being
 
04:32:53.389 --> 04:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
surrounded by like-minded people who
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
offer support empathy and accountability
 
04:32:58.229 --> 04:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
can be the difference between becoming a
 
04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
success story or a
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
statistic Phil used to say my guys are
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
like any other group of adults who
 
04:33:08.429 --> 04:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
choose to live together we are a family
 
04:33:11.029 --> 04:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
by choice and we deserve the rights of a
 
04:33:13.590 --> 04:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
family and certainly the rights of any
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
group of
 
04:33:17.349 --> 04:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
housemates non-clinical recovery housing
 
04:33:19.470 --> 04:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
is simply a group of men or women
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
choosing to split expenses by sharing a
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
home like lots of people do nowadays
 
04:33:26.150 --> 04:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
with the added benefit that this shared
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
home creates lifesaving support for an
 
04:33:30.910 --> 04:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
issue we're always talking about wanting
 
04:33:30.920 --> 04:33:32.390 align:start position:0%
issue we're always talking about wanting
to

04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:33:35.269 --> 04:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
mitigate Phil sober houses in lonia are
 
04:33:37.629 --> 04:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
still operational the guys living there
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
work in the labor force serve in the
 
04:33:41.070 --> 04:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
community pay their taxes you've heard
 
04:33:42.590 --> 04:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
lots of stories people already here
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
today I think I'm you know beating a
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
dead horse there but anyway we get the
 
04:33:48.551 --> 04:33:48.561 align:start position:0%
point that sober houses produce really
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
good results and it's specifically
 
04:33:54.109 --> 04:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
because of that early sobriety Phil
 
04:33:56.670 --> 04:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
worked really hard to open sober houses
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
before all the requirements were in
 
04:34:01.029 --> 04:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
place that are there now even more
 
04:34:02.990 --> 04:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
hurdles then and he just used to
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
complain about why are you making it so
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
hard for me to help people so the point
 
04:34:09.990 --> 04:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
that I want to bring here to this group
 
04:34:13.629 --> 04:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
amid all you're hearing today is
 
04:34:16.230 --> 04:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
just alongside the protections that are
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
in place whatever we do to make it easy
 
04:34:21.869 --> 04:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
rather than hard and you know I think
 
04:34:23.709 --> 04:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
the bad actor point was a really fair
 
04:34:26.709 --> 04:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
one and I think as has been said it's
 
04:34:29.470 --> 04:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
not the Bad actors that that we really
 
04:34:31.470 --> 04:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
need to focus on it's all the people who
 
04:34:33.310 --> 04:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
are trying so hard to do this and are
 
04:34:35.230 --> 04:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
coming up against all these obstacles
 
04:34:36.750 --> 04:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
from towns that are pushing back and
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
just a whole lot of not in my backyard
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
response which I get and it's fair but
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
it is not the whole story and it does
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
not bring to this how many people are
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
fighting for their lives and what a
 
04:34:54.429 --> 04:34:54.439 align:start position:0%
relatively easy intervention it is just
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
to make it easy for towns to open or for
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%
houses to open and and harder for people
 
04:35:06.470 --> 04:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
to push back um in in this great big
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
broad Strokes
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
measure um yeah so anyway going back on
 
04:35:15.109 --> 04:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
script now during his time in the State
 
04:35:16.830 --> 04:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
House Phil sat on the Health and Human
 
04:35:18.990 --> 04:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
Services committee advocating for the
 
04:35:21.310 --> 04:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
needs of Grant stators in addiction and
 
04:35:24.349 --> 04:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
Recovery I'm here in his place today
 
04:35:27.109 --> 04:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
eight years sober to remind you that the
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
addict can become the public servant
 
04:35:31.551 --> 04:35:31.561 align:start position:0%
when they're given the chance and the
 
04:35:33.789 --> 04:35:33.799 align:start position:0%
support that all flavors of people
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%

opening the way for more houses to open
 
04:35:57.709 --> 04:35:57.719 align:start position:0%

rather than creating more hurdles to
those

04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%

previous members previous to me said um
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not from here I'm from Boston but I
 
04:37:00.789 --> 04:37:00.799 align:start position:0%
did live in sober living for three plus
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
years um I recently achieved over three
 
04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
years of sobriety um I now work in the
 
04:37:07.869 --> 04:37:07.879 align:start position:0%
recovery field um a case manager for a
 
04:37:10.189 --> 04:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
treatment center so I also have experien
 
04:37:12.150 --> 04:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
helping clients transition ition from
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
higher levels of care down to um types
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
of sober living um couple things I'll
 
04:37:18.269 --> 04:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
just add that I don't know if we're
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
brought up but um across the entire
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
State you know I've helped hundreds if
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
not thousands of people apply for sober
 
04:37:25.990 --> 04:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
living um and they all have pretty tough
 
04:37:27.789 --> 04:37:27.799 align:start position:0%
standards you know there's always uh
 
04:37:29.150 --> 04:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
requirements that you're working a
 
04:37:30.670 --> 04:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
program that you've completed some kind
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
of Prior treatment stabilization um
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
people don't just enter straight into it
 
04:37:38.349 --> 04:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
um and also say that of you know moving
 
04:37:40.109 --> 04:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
into the future as I hope to buy a home
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
someday um i' be very happy to have a
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
neighbor that's in a house full of
 
04:37:47.470 --> 04:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
people that are actively recovering and
 
04:37:48.910 --> 04:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
required to be working on themselves and
 
04:37:50.789 --> 04:37:50.799 align:start position:0%
proving themselves U because I've had a
 
04:37:52.189 --> 04:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
lot of Neighbors in the past that I wish
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
they were doing things like that so just
 
04:37:55.109 --> 04:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
in the structured environment that I
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
experienced of being pushed to you know
 
04:38:00.269 --> 04:38:00.279 align:start position:0%
work with a sponsor uh identify areas of
 
04:38:01.750 --> 04:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
my life that I needed Improvement have
 
04:38:03.629 --> 04:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
Community things like that um that was
 
04:38:05.709 --> 04:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
just very beneficial for me and um I
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
believe it would honestly is the only
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
reason I'm sitting in front of you here
 
04:38:10.750 --> 04:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
today because I did several types of
 
04:38:12.830 --> 04:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
treatment throughout my uh time in
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
recovery and um the only missing piece
 
04:38:17.189 --> 04:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
for me was the sober living you know
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
they say the domains of recovery or
 
04:38:22.830 --> 04:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
health home community and purpose and um
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know addressed my mental health I
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
went to programs that every time I went
 
04:38:26.910 --> 04:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
home I didn't have that safe structured
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
environment um that I could reintegrate
 
04:38:30.750 --> 04:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
with the community with the new
 
04:38:32.349 --> 04:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
behavioral skills that I was learning in
 
04:38:34.390 --> 04:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
treatment so I believe that was just the
 
04:38:35.949 --> 04:38:35.959 align:start position:0%
essential puzzle piece for my own
 
04:38:38.349 --> 04:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
recovery um to like I said reintegrate
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
with the community um yeah that's that's
 
04:38:43.109 --> 04:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
really all I got to add um if anyone has
 
04:38:45.390 --> 04:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions open to it thank you for your
 
04:38:45.400 --> 04:38:48.789 align:start position:0%
questions open to it thank you for your
testimony

04:38:53.709 --> 04:38:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
you next the chair calls M eron Thor
 
04:39:02.910 --> 04:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
Barry welcome to Municipal and County
 
04:39:07.949 --> 04:39:07.959 align:start position:0%
government oh thank you um I'm Aon
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
thalson with the Council of state
 
04:39:10.789 --> 04:39:10.799 align:start position:0%
government Justice Center we are a
 
04:39:13.470 --> 04:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
national nonprofit nonpartisan
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
organization um in support of the bill
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh so we have worked in New Hampshire
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
since 2021 studying and providing policy
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations specific to the high
 
04:39:24.910 --> 04:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
utilizer population those who are
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
cycling between the behavioral health
 
04:39:28.429 --> 04:39:28.439 align:start position:0%
and criminal justice systems and who
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
often have substance use disorders
 
04:39:33.070 --> 04:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
mental health challenges or both the
 
04:39:36.510 --> 04:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
high uer population is unique in 2024 we
 
04:39:38.788 --> 04:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
found that high UTI utilizers in New
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were more likely to be
 
04:39:42.270 --> 04:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
unhoused compared compared to non-high
 
04:39:45.750 --> 04:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
utili utilizers we're generally admitted
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
to county jail or state prison for
 
04:39:49.830 --> 04:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
supervision violations and were
 
04:39:51.830 --> 04:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
expensive to incarcerate at a three-year
 
04:39:54.030 --> 04:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
cost of $123
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
million such violations are often
 
04:39:58.670 --> 04:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
technical in nature meaning it is not a
 
04:40:00.470 --> 04:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
new crime that is bringing them back to
 
04:40:02.670 --> 04:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
prison but due to behaviors such as
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
missing an appointment or using alcohol
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
or drugs we further know that time after
 
04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
release can be uncertain as resources
 
04:40:11.910 --> 04:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
and support may be low
 
04:40:14.310 --> 04:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
we looked at the top Services asso um
 
04:40:16.708 --> 04:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
accessed by individuals after release
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%

04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
top five Services accessed House Bill
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%

environments one of the Bill's most
 
04:41:05.030 --> 04:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
significant Provisions is the Equitable

and I'll take any questions other
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
speaker the chair recognizes
 
04:42:37.628 --> 04:42:37.638 align:start position:0%
representative majori thank you madam
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
chairwoman and thank you for being here
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
to testify this might be a dumb question
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
question that the gentleman behind you
 
04:42:43.510 --> 04:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
who testified I probably should have
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
asked to but if you had a four-bedroom
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
home is that four residents or could it
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
be eight residents I'm wondering how
 
04:42:53.550 --> 04:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
many people per bedroom that is
 
04:42:55.470 --> 04:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
something I would not be able to speak
 
04:42:58.350 --> 04:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
to Okay so thank
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
you representative

frock thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um one of the
 
04:43:09.910 --> 04:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
previous speakers testified to a
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction
 
04:43:16.270 --> 04:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
study that uh I believe he said a
 
04:43:21.990 --> 04:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
43% reiv recidivism rate um of the total
 
04:43:26.830 --> 04:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
Universe of people who are in substance
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
recovery would you have any stats on how
 
04:43:33.310 --> 04:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
many are involved in the criminal
 
04:43:36.190 --> 04:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
justice system versus the percentage
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
that are not involved with criminal
 
04:43:42.470 --> 04:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
justice system that's a great question I
 
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately don't have official stats
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
right at my disposal at the moment um
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
but we can pass along some information
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
on that if you could research and uh
 
04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
provide that information I think the
 
04:43:55.470 --> 04:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
committee would appreciate that of
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%

stavis thank you madam chair and I'm

that's okay um do sober houses typically
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
have paid staff
 
04:44:16.070 --> 04:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh typically in in my experience yes and
 
04:44:18.670 --> 04:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
are they classified as businesses under
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law that I would not be
 
04:44:23.550 --> 04:44:23.560 align:start position:0%

04:44:52.628 --> 04:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:54.510 --> 04:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
government thank you madam chair
 
04:44:55.628 --> 04:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee my
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
name is Jake Barry uh I work for new
 
04:45:00.190 --> 04:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
Futures which many of you many of you
 
04:45:02.150 --> 04:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
know is a nonpartisan nonprofit Health
 
04:45:04.390 --> 04:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
policy and advocacy organization we've
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
been working for more than 25 years to
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
address issues around substance use and
 
04:45:10.350 --> 04:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health in our state uh I
 
04:45:11.628 --> 04:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat too much of what's
 
04:45:13.230 --> 04:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
been said obviously we stand in strong
 
04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
support of the bill I do want to
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
reinforce a few critical points number
 
04:45:19.590 --> 04:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
one I want to make sure data as referred
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
to earlier data is crystal clear that
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods that have access to
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
recovery housing experience lower rates
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
of substance use lower rates of other
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
drug related crimes lower rates of
 
04:45:31.788 --> 04:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
incarceration and overall enhanced uh
 
04:45:33.230 --> 04:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
not just health and well-being of
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
individuals but in the the neighborhoods
 
04:45:37.750 --> 04:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the communities themselves uh
 
04:45:38.910 --> 04:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
another point that I would really like
 
04:45:42.510 --> 04:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
to make is that again this bill there's
 
04:45:44.230 --> 04:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
been a lot of talk about Bad actors this
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
bill applies only to Certified Recovery
 
04:45:48.990 --> 04:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
homes as has been alerted to alluded to
 
04:45:52.510 --> 04:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
earlier in this hearing uh there are uh
 
04:45:54.550 --> 04:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
numerous entities that in the state that
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
are certifying recovery homes they are
 
04:45:59.948 --> 04:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
going by uh uh National national
 
04:46:01.868 --> 04:46:01.878 align:start position:0%
standards uh that they are following
 
04:46:04.670 --> 04:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
there are are uh 30 plus other standards
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
they can get into more specifically the
 
04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
Govern uh the operations the physical
 
04:46:11.110 --> 04:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
and and and and social well-being and
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
health and and safety of the uh both the
 
04:46:15.628 --> 04:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
home itself and again of the the
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding community so this bill
 
04:46:18.990 --> 04:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
really does not apply to the Bad actors
 
04:46:21.350 --> 04:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
that we are discussing here um I thought
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
it might be helpful to provide a little
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
bit of background to how we got here uh
 
04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
this bill originally came from a
 
04:46:27.788 --> 04:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
discussion held back in the spring of
 
04:46:29.990 --> 04:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
2023 we got together at the time with
 
04:46:31.788 --> 04:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
our friends at the Coalition of recovery
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
residences the New Hampshire Housing
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority local planners and and
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh and and leaders uh to discuss ways
 
04:46:41.030 --> 04:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
to support the growth of recovery
 
04:46:42.910 --> 04:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
housing around the state and at the time
 
04:46:44.830 --> 04:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
one of the obstacles that was identified
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
was a lack of clarity among cities and
 
04:46:48.510 --> 04:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
towns about what exactly recovery
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
housing recovery houses are and how best
 
04:46:53.070 --> 04:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
to treat them through local zoning and
 
04:46:55.150 --> 04:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
emergency regulation after that we
 
04:46:58.270 --> 04:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
worked for months uh with Town planners
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
the fire Marshall's office again our
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
friends at New Hampshire Housing and
 
04:47:04.230 --> 04:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
others to craft this language what we
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
came up with before you uh which
 
04:47:08.190 --> 04:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
clarifies that recovery houses are
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
residential facilities not medical
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
facilities as many correctly believe um
 
04:47:14.990 --> 04:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
the language used is in alignment with
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
exist existing state fire code and
 
04:47:19.708 --> 04:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
federal definitions of recovery housing
 
04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh as I've mentioned this bill was
 
04:47:22.990 --> 04:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
crafted with the assistance and of the
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
the planners Association the F Marshals
 
04:47:27.110 --> 04:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
office other many other stakeholders it
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
has the strong support obviously of
 
04:47:30.788 --> 04:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
recovery housing operators substance use
 
04:47:32.868 --> 04:47:32.878 align:start position:0%
providers uh treatment providers housing
 
04:47:34.628 --> 04:47:34.638 align:start position:0%
and homeless organizations and some in
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
Municipal leaders who agree will provide
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh guidance cities and towns need to
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
support the development of recovery
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
houses around the state and help them to
 
04:47:42.910 --> 04:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
avoid some of the fair housing
 
04:47:44.788 --> 04:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
litigation that we've seen uh filed
 
04:47:46.030 --> 04:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
against cities and towns including
 
04:47:49.548 --> 04:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
Manchester and nsha in recent years
 
04:47:53.708 --> 04:47:53.718 align:start position:0%
um with that I am happy to take
 
04:47:55.510 --> 04:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
questions the last thing I do want to
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%

04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
again we have certifying entities in the
 
04:48:50.990 --> 04:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
state who are who are out there
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
conducting certification inspections and
 
04:48:54.670 --> 04:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
making sure you know and and issuing the
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
certifications themselves uh they
 
04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm sure and again they're in
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
the room they can work but I'm they
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
frequently work with municipalities I
 
04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
think who would um uh you know be able
 
04:49:05.270 --> 04:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
to again check on the status and I will
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
say the reason that we settled on one
 
04:49:08.948 --> 04:49:08.958 align:start position:0%
year you know we want to make sure that
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
we are are meaning the B balance of
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
providing homes the time they need to
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
complete the certification process and
 
04:49:16.190 --> 04:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
they really in many cases need to be up
 
04:49:17.708 --> 04:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
and running in order to go through that
 
04:49:19.390 --> 04:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
certification process so we want to make
 
04:49:20.948 --> 04:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
sure that they have enough time to get
 
04:49:23.910 --> 04:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
off the ground uh in order to uh again
 
04:49:25.030 --> 04:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they meet those
 
04:49:26.670 --> 04:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
certification standards so we wanted to
 
04:49:28.470 --> 04:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we provided uh enough
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
time to do that without so much time
 
04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
that they were able to um abuse any any
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
lapses or or anything like
 
04:49:41.628 --> 04:49:41.638 align:start position:0%
that yes and in the event that year they
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
do not meet certification what happens
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
oh at that point you know local
 
04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
Regulators local zoning officials are
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
able to step in the way that they are
 
04:49:53.548 --> 04:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
and you know the same if um uh you know
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
the same way they enforce any other
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
zoning C zoning codes
 
04:49:58.160 --> 04:49:59.788 align:start position:0%
zoning C zoning codes
locally

04:49:59.788 --> 04:49:59.798 align:start position:0%
locally
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
sure representative
 
04:50:04.110 --> 04:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:50:07.548 --> 04:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um in here
 
04:50:10.390 --> 04:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's line 14 and 15 where it talks about
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
the use of an existing multif family
 
04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
structure as a recovery house under this
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph shall not require site plan
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
review we heard a concern that is there
 
04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
um you know health safety concerns can
 
04:50:25.548 --> 04:50:25.558 align:start position:0%
you speak to um the process of being
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
certified do they look at building the
 
04:50:32.390 --> 04:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
site plan concept do they work through
 
04:50:33.670 --> 04:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
that to make sure there aren't any other
 
04:50:35.390 --> 04:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
safety concerns again there's certainly
 
04:50:37.868 --> 04:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
others in the room who work more work in
 
04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
a day-to-day way more in in the
 
04:50:41.150 --> 04:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
certification process who can speak to
 
04:50:42.510 --> 04:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
that certainly again many of the
 
04:50:44.590 --> 04:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
certification standards do govern many
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
of the same um health and and Welfare uh
 
04:50:50.548 --> 04:50:50.558 align:start position:0%
uh areas that are governed in in in um
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
by by site plan review uh and again I do
 
04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
want to be crystal clear that that these
 
04:50:58.150 --> 04:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
houses will be absolutely held to the
 
04:51:00.030 --> 04:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
same zoning requirements and regulations
 
04:51:01.948 --> 04:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
as any other uh you know as any other
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
multif family or similarly you uh use
 
04:51:07.150 --> 04:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
building that is in fact at the root of
 
04:51:08.548 --> 04:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
the very intention of the bill is to
 
04:51:09.990 --> 04:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that that that these houses are
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
held to the same standard as any other
 
04:51:14.070 --> 04:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
multif family or M multi-unit structure
 
04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
and and not beyond that again as is
 
04:51:18.830 --> 04:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
restricted by by federal fair housing
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
regulations the chair recognizes
 
04:51:21.040 --> 04:51:22.590 align:start position:0%
regulations the chair recognizes
representative

04:51:22.590 --> 04:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:51:26.788 --> 04:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it has to do
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
with uh fire codes sure um and to the
 
04:51:34.030 --> 04:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
best of my recollection in
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
2018 we revised F A we passed a bill
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
that revised the fire code to require
 
04:51:42.868 --> 04:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
sprinklers in these
 
04:51:42.878 --> 04:51:45.390 align:start position:0%
sprinklers in these
facilities

04:51:45.390 --> 04:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
um sprinklers municipalities are
 
04:51:52.190 --> 04:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
prohibited from requiring sprinklers in
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
single family houses and
 
04:51:59.270 --> 04:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
duplexes how do those two things mesh in
 
04:52:02.590 --> 04:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
your mind sure no no that with with with
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
the zoning language in this bill that
 
04:52:07.150 --> 04:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
that's a fantastic question and and
 
04:52:10.350 --> 04:52:10.360 align:start position:0%
again I want to be clear I'm not I'm not
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
a building professional I'm not an
 
04:52:14.350 --> 04:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement professional um I you know
 
04:52:16.590 --> 04:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
we did work on I recall the bill you're
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
talking about there was another bill
 
04:52:19.310 --> 04:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
that we worked on a number of years ago
 
04:52:23.788 --> 04:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
that passed that sort of clarified the
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
um process of I'm I'm blanking on the
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
formal term the process of seeking an
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
exemption from um from the fire
 
04:52:31.868 --> 04:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office uh in in in these
 
04:52:31.878 --> 04:52:33.708 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office uh in in in these
cases

04:52:33.708 --> 04:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:52:35.670 --> 04:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I can answer the
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
question as as as articul articulately
 
04:52:40.270 --> 04:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
as I would like uh I think the again the
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
the the clear thing to keep in mind I
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
would say is these facilities are held
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
to the same fire and safety codes as any
 
04:52:48.788 --> 04:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
other multi-use facility that you know
 
04:52:51.190 --> 04:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
that is used the uh um that that has as
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
multiple families and they they um yes
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh they will be held to the same
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
standards nothing all we're asking for
 
04:53:02.150 --> 04:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.670 --> 04:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
Beyond representative
 
04:53:07.190 --> 04:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
Elward thank you madam chairman thank
 
04:53:10.590 --> 04:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question on line 18
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
uses the word
 
04:53:16.350 --> 04:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
operator the its operator shall first
 
04:53:18.948 --> 04:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
provide written notification to the
 
04:53:22.270 --> 04:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
local governing body at least 30 days
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
prior to and on line 20 it says the
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
local governing body May seek to ensure
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
that the recovery house is either
 
04:53:34.110 --> 04:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
certified or seeking certification would
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
it not be the operator who is seeking
 
04:53:40.230 --> 04:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
certification and not the the recovery
 
04:53:40.240 --> 04:53:42.190 align:start position:0%
certification and not the the recovery
house

04:53:42.190 --> 04:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:53:45.628 --> 04:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
house certainly I see I I I see clearly
 
04:53:46.590 --> 04:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
what you're pointing out here and I
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
think that that does seem to be an
 
04:53:49.548 --> 04:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the language that I'm
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
certain that we could iron out for sure
 
04:53:54.110 --> 04:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I have a follow-up question
 
04:53:58.390 --> 04:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
sure if the operator is
 
04:53:58.400 --> 04:54:00.430 align:start position:0%
sure if the operator is
the

04:54:00.430 --> 04:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:03.750 --> 04:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh certificate holder
 
04:54:08.548 --> 04:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
MH are they also the homeowner the
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
building owner
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
and if
 
04:54:16.230 --> 04:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
so would this not be like a home
 
04:54:19.230 --> 04:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
occupation so in some cases and again
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
there others in the room can speak to
 
04:54:22.230 --> 04:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
this better than who have more firsthand
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
experience in this than I do in some
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
cases they are the owner operator in
 
04:54:27.150 --> 04:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
some cases they're not they they they
 
04:54:28.990 --> 04:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know lease or rent or manage the
 
04:54:31.390 --> 04:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
property say that again please I'm sorry
 
04:54:32.910 --> 04:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
in some cases they are the owner
 
04:54:34.830 --> 04:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
operator of the building they they own
 
04:54:36.910 --> 04:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
the building as well as op as operate in
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
other cases they uh they you know it's
 
04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's run by you know they they rent it
 
04:54:43.948 --> 04:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
or lease it or or or have a property
 
04:54:46.708 --> 04:54:46.718 align:start position:0%
management uh uh Arrangement just as any
 
04:54:49.990 --> 04:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
other multif family uh uh
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
operation thank you further
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:54:57.990 --> 04:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
Gerard thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:55:00.510 --> 04:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you mentioned
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
that the home needed to be up and
 
04:55:04.230 --> 04:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
running prior to applying for
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
certification is there a certain
 
04:55:07.750 --> 04:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
standard that you have to meet to be
 
04:55:09.190 --> 04:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
able to start applying is there a
 
04:55:10.910 --> 04:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
certain number of uh folks that would
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
need to be in the home what is the
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
process I I thank you for the question

am not ignorant to the fact that there
 
04:58:17.990 --> 04:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
may be very well concerns about this
 
04:58:20.150 --> 04:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
demographic that being said thoughtful

recovery homes um seek to meet the
 
04:59:00.670 --> 04:59:00.680 align:start position:0%

certification national standards speak
 
04:59:25.510 --> 04:59:25.520 align:start position:0%

04:59:28.990 --> 04:59:29.000 align:start position:0%

I'm the fair housing director at New
 
05:00:13.150 --> 05:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance I'm here
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
today to speak in favor of HP 432 a bill
 
05:00:18.070 --> 05:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
that clarifies how recovery houses will
 
05:00:20.430 --> 05:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
be treated for zoning purposes plenty of
 
05:00:22.510 --> 05:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
our clients at nhla have been aided by
 
05:00:24.190 --> 05:00:24.200 align:start position:0%
the services of recovery houses in
 
05:00:25.270 --> 05:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
supporting their Journey out of
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
addiction and in independent living and
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
long-term recovery beyond the benefits
 
05:00:31.190 --> 05:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
that recovery housing has for some of
 
05:00:33.070 --> 05:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
our clients what I specifically want to
 
05:00:34.830 --> 05:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
address in my testimony today is my
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
support for the bill is that uh is the
 
05:00:38.670 --> 05:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
benefits that I believe municipalities
 
05:00:40.470 --> 05:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
will receive by avoiding Fair Housing
 
05:00:42.390 --> 05:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
Act litigation over zoning decisions
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
regarding recovery
 
05:00:46.230 --> 05:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
homes one of the more common areas of
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
fair housing litigation is in regard to
 
05:00:50.190 --> 05:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
recovery homes the Fair Housing Act
 
05:00:51.708 --> 05:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
prohibits discrimination in housing
 
05:00:54.350 --> 05:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
based on race color na religion sex
 
05:00:56.470 --> 05:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
national origin familial status and
 
05:00:58.270 --> 05:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
disability while many think of the
 
05:00:59.830 --> 05:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
rental and sale of housing as the
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
traditional subject area where the Fair
 
05:01:03.390 --> 05:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
Housing Act comes into play it also
 
05:01:05.310 --> 05:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
applies to other actions and actors that
 
05:01:06.990 --> 05:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
touch on housing such as Municipal
 
05:01:09.270 --> 05:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
zoning boards in fact one of the main
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
motivations in passing the Fair Housing
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
Act was to end discriminatory zoning
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
policies throughout the act's history
 
05:01:16.350 --> 05:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
Recovery Home sighting has been a
 
05:01:18.030 --> 05:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
subject of fair housing litigation
 
05:01:19.310 --> 05:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
primarily dealing with efforts by
 
05:01:20.670 --> 05:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities to use their zoning
 
05:01:22.990 --> 05:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
powers to restrict their operation
 
05:01:24.910 --> 05:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorder is a disability
 
05:01:26.628 --> 05:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
under the fair housing act and as such
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
recovery homes are protected by the fair
 
05:01:30.030 --> 05:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
housing act based upon disability status
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:36.390 --> 05:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
serve HP 432 is intended to clarify the
 
05:01:38.190 --> 05:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
zoning process in order to eliminate
 
05:01:40.590 --> 05:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
confusion and prevent actions Municipal
 
05:01:42.510 --> 05:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
zoning boards that may lead to costly
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
Fair Housing Act lawsuits this bill
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
would um specify how a recovery house is
 
05:01:49.110 --> 05:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
zoned preventing potential unintended
 
05:01:50.830 --> 05:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
zoning actions that may implicate
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
implicate the fair housing act in New
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alone there have been multiple
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuites brought in the past few years
 
05:01:57.548 --> 05:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
against municipalities who have used
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
their zoning powers to restrict recovery
 
05:02:02.430 --> 05:02:02.440 align:start position:0%

challenge or issue in the region I am
 
05:02:12.708 --> 05:02:12.718 align:start position:0%
also aware that municipalities and other
 
05:02:15.390 --> 05:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
states we border face the same issues
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
Fitchburg and Wester u m in
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts were subject to
 
05:02:21.310 --> 05:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
significant litigation in 2019 and 2021
 
05:02:22.708 --> 05:02:22.718 align:start position:0%
that led to development of case law on
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
the issue here in the first
 
05:02:26.548 --> 05:02:26.558 align:start position:0%
circuit the presence of a lawsuit does
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily mean that a municipality
 
05:02:30.548 --> 05:02:30.558 align:start position:0%
has used its zoning power improperly or
 
05:02:33.150 --> 05:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
in a discriminatory manner however even
 
05:02:34.510 --> 05:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
when a municipality prevails in a
 
05:02:36.830 --> 05:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit the damage may already be done
 
05:02:38.350 --> 05:02:38.360 align:start position:0%
recovery homes necessary to support
 
05:02:39.910 --> 05:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
residents of the state are denied
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
leaving those seeking recovery with no
 
05:02:43.990 --> 05:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
good options towns further face costly
 
05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
litigation that drains its time and
 
05:02:48.868 --> 05:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
resources with the expiration of federal
 
05:02:51.628 --> 05:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
um funding for um during from during the
 
05:02:54.310 --> 05:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
co pandemic funds uh many municipalities
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
are facing tighter budgets that may be
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
dramatically impacted by litigation
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
costs which may require higher taxes or
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
challenging decisions on cutting
 
05:03:03.510 --> 05:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
services this in turn is passed on to
 
05:03:05.310 --> 05:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayers who may bear the cost of
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
higher taxes for zoning decisions they
 
05:03:08.708 --> 05:03:08.718 align:start position:0%
were not involved with and did not
 
05:03:11.708 --> 05:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
support by clarifying how Recovery House
 
05:03:13.948 --> 05:03:13.958 align:start position:0%
houses are zoned I believe that HP 432
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
will help increase Recovery Home apply
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate confusion that Municipal
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
zoning boards May face when considering
 
05:03:22.030 --> 05:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
recovery homes and avoid potentially
 
05:03:24.390 --> 05:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
costly litigation expenses I ask the
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
committee to support HP 432 and welcome
 
05:03:28.270 --> 05:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
any questions that I might be able to
 
05:03:30.350 --> 05:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
answer thank you for your
 
05:03:30.360 --> 05:03:32.868 align:start position:0%
answer thank you for your
time

05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:03:35.030 --> 05:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions the chair recognizes
 
05:03:37.030 --> 05:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman for a
 
05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:03:41.548 --> 05:03:41.558 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:03:45.590 --> 05:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I I'm curious about the phrase in
 
05:03:49.350 --> 05:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
where I marked it up um the use of an
 
05:03:52.708 --> 05:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
existing this is lines 14 and 15 the use
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
of an existing multif family structure
 
05:03:56.910 --> 05:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
as recovery house under this paragraph
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
shall not require site plan review and
 
05:04:03.030 --> 05:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
given the the nature of the purpose of
 
05:04:07.270 --> 05:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
the recovery houses that gather folks
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
from separately not in a family why why
 
05:04:14.830 --> 05:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
is the the multif family one uh not
 
05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
require site plan review but the single
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
family it you
 
05:04:24.230 --> 05:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
know shouldn't the single family also be
 
05:04:26.910 --> 05:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
or maybe I just answer my
 
05:04:28.990 --> 05:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah and I do apologize for
 
05:04:30.548 --> 05:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
anything drafting related to this I will
 
05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
refer to Mr Barry which I know was a
 
05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
common refrain today but thank you yes
 
05:04:41.310 --> 05:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
okay never mind representative stavis
 
05:04:43.030 --> 05:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm going to sound like a
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
broken record but I'm I'm still trying
 
05:04:48.190 --> 05:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
to get an answer to the question of
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
whether the recovery
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
houses as defined in this bill are
 
05:04:58.110 --> 05:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
businesses are they
 
05:05:01.868 --> 05:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
nonprofits uh what is their
 
05:05:04.430 --> 05:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
taxable standing what you know how are
 
05:05:07.270 --> 05:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
they defined under taxation laws I
 
05:05:09.230 --> 05:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
believe it depends on the specific um
 
05:05:10.868 --> 05:05:10.878 align:start position:0%
recovery home but again that's not my
 
05:05:13.270 --> 05:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
area of expertise I would refer it to Mr
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
answer further
 
05:05:26.590 --> 05:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%

05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
now uh we've had a lot of testimony
 
05:06:58.990 --> 05:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
about the benefits of recovery housing I
 
05:07:02.430 --> 05:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
can tell you it's it's far and way the
 
05:07:06.110 --> 05:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
biggest problem we're dealing with uh in
 
05:07:09.510 --> 05:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
helping people suffering from sud in LW
 
05:07:09.520 --> 05:07:10.750 align:start position:0%
helping people suffering from sud in LW
long-term

05:07:10.750 --> 05:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
05:07:15.110 --> 05:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
addiction housing is a major problem if
 
05:07:17.708 --> 05:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
we can get people into a secure stable
 
05:07:20.788 --> 05:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
housing environment we can M they are
 
05:07:23.948 --> 05:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
much more successful in sustaining their
 
05:07:26.070 --> 05:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
recovery uh they get and they get back
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
into the workforce they get back with
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
their families and we're looking
 
05:07:33.230 --> 05:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
at uh 9 months to two years in sober
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
living or longer if if the situation
 
05:07:41.590 --> 05:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
fits uh I don't see sober living is a
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
transient place we call them it's
 
05:07:47.590 --> 05:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
they're now called recovery
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
housing the um the issue here as I see
 
05:07:56.868 --> 05:07:56.878 align:start position:0%
it is we have towns treating recovery
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
houses in in different ways uh I'm
 
05:08:02.390 --> 05:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
trying to open one right now I'm not
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to name the town but I've been
 
05:08:07.628 --> 05:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
told I have to do site plan I have to do
 
05:08:10.590 --> 05:08:10.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh go through planning go through uh
 
05:08:10.600 --> 05:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
uh uh go through planning go through uh
planning

05:08:11.510 --> 05:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
planning
 
05:08:16.270 --> 05:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
review it's a single family home that uh
 
05:08:19.948 --> 05:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not changing the size of the house
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh I'm complying with the standards uh
 
05:08:26.070 --> 05:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
for Recovery housing uh national
 
05:08:27.750 --> 05:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
standards which
 
05:08:30.390 --> 05:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
are uh in terms of how many people per
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
bedroom I I need at least 50 square feet
 
05:08:37.230 --> 05:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
per bed so I can put two people in a
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
bedroom uh
 
05:08:43.230 --> 05:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
we will have very strict requirements
 
05:08:45.230 --> 05:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
for drug
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
testing uh very strict requirements um
 
05:08:55.310 --> 05:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
require uh for uh Counseling Group
 
05:08:59.350 --> 05:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
attendance to group meetings U and it's
 
05:09:02.590 --> 05:09:02.600 align:start position:0%
a very supportive
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
environment people living as a single
 
05:09:10.150 --> 05:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
family um the under fact federal law as
 
05:09:11.110 --> 05:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
you just
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
heard if you treat people if you treat
 
05:09:17.470 --> 05:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of housing differently from a
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
normal single family house there's a
 
05:09:21.628 --> 05:09:21.638 align:start position:0%
potential for litigation I'm not
 
05:09:23.350 --> 05:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
litigious I'm not going to be filing
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against the town it's not what
 
05:09:30.350 --> 05:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
I want to do but it can happen and this
 
05:09:34.350 --> 05:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
bill it this bill
 
05:09:38.510 --> 05:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
um provides towns the benefit of not
 
05:09:40.830 --> 05:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
running a f
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
of federal law on this and I can read
 
05:09:47.628 --> 05:09:47.638 align:start position:0%

05:10:08.708 --> 05:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
disabilities that were not imposed on
 
05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
families and groups of similar size or
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
of other unrelated
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
people under the Americans with
 
05:10:19.868 --> 05:10:19.878 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act and this is another
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
quote from the right from the statute no
 
05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
qualified individual with a disability
 
05:10:27.750 --> 05:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
shall by reason of such disability be
 
05:10:30.430 --> 05:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
excluded from participation in or or be
 
05:10:32.270 --> 05:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
denied the benefits of the services
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
programs or activities of of a public
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
entity or be subjected to discrimination
 
05:10:39.948 --> 05:10:39.958 align:start position:0%
by such entities
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
so when you treat recovery homes
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
differently from a a single family
 
05:10:51.708 --> 05:10:51.718 align:start position:0%
home you open yourself up to be ued
 
05:10:53.708 --> 05:10:53.718 align:start position:0%
under these two
 
05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
statutes so I'm happy to take
 
05:11:01.670 --> 05:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions the chair re Rec recognizes
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
rep representative major thank you madam
 
05:11:06.190 --> 05:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
chairwoman thank you for taking my
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
question if you were to if one of of
 
05:11:12.430 --> 05:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
your houses were to require a or had a
 
05:11:17.310 --> 05:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
failed septic system how would
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
Dees how would
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
Dees evaluate the size the proper sizing
 
05:11:25.390 --> 05:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
of the septic
 
05:11:27.670 --> 05:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
system do you know the answer to that I
 
05:11:30.590 --> 05:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
do not okay
 
05:11:33.230 --> 05:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
thanks representative majority I I
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
believe I know the answer and the answer
 
05:11:37.750 --> 05:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that the septic system is sized to
 
05:11:41.590 --> 05:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
the um to to to to the house to the
 
05:11:45.628 --> 05:11:45.638 align:start position:0%
number of of bedrooms and not occupants
 
05:11:48.590 --> 05:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
correct and and that's where I wonder if
 
05:11:52.230 --> 05:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
de I wonder if May question of the
 
05:11:54.788 --> 05:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
chair is that something we could follow
 
05:11:58.110 --> 05:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
up with on Dees with Dees I think you
 
05:12:00.190 --> 05:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
just volunteered to do that I
 
05:12:00.200 --> 05:12:02.070 align:start position:0%
just volunteered to do that I
[Laughter]

05:12:02.070 --> 05:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.470 --> 05:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
it representative Grant
 
05:12:11.590 --> 05:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:12:13.590 --> 05:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm going to ask
 
05:12:15.270 --> 05:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
the question I did before because maybe
 
05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
you're able to answer this but um on
 
05:12:20.430 --> 05:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
line 145 where it says use of an
 
05:12:21.788 --> 05:12:21.798 align:start position:0%
existing multif family structures
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
recovery house under this paragraph
 
05:12:25.548 --> 05:12:25.558 align:start position:0%
shall not require a site plan review
 
05:12:27.868 --> 05:12:27.878 align:start position:0%
during the certification process of a
 
05:12:30.590 --> 05:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
program for Recovery Home Does it
 
05:12:33.150 --> 05:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
include steps that are similar to a site
 
05:12:36.110 --> 05:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
plan review uh there's a lot of detail
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
that goes in well I would say no I mean
 
05:12:41.150 --> 05:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
site planner view is if you're changing
 
05:12:43.510 --> 05:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
the site so I would say no but there's a
 
05:12:45.430 --> 05:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
lot that goes into how you're running
 
05:12:48.350 --> 05:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
the house the rules inside the house the
 
05:12:50.708 --> 05:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
size requirements for
 
05:12:50.718 --> 05:12:52.230 align:start position:0%
size requirements for
bedrooms

05:12:52.230 --> 05:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
bedrooms
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
um you're you have to have one shower
 
05:12:56.910 --> 05:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
for every six residences one bathroom
 
05:13:00.868 --> 05:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
for every six residents
 
05:13:03.628 --> 05:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
so further
 
05:13:07.590 --> 05:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank oh sorry
 
05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
representative Gerard thank you madam
 
05:13:12.030 --> 05:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
chair uh I'm hoping you might be able to
 
05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
answer the question I had asked another
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
person earlier uh I think when you
 
05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
started talking about the certification
 
05:13:19.230 --> 05:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
process that someone mentioned that they
 
05:13:20.948 --> 05:13:20.958 align:start position:0%
had to be up and running to be able to
 
05:13:22.990 --> 05:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
apply for certification is there a
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
certain standard as far as how how
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
much how many people need to be in
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
the environment before they can apply
 
05:13:32.040 --> 05:13:33.070 align:start position:0%
the environment before they can apply
for

05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:13:35.788 --> 05:13:35.798 align:start position:0%
certification I don't know if there is
 
05:13:39.708 --> 05:13:39.718 align:start position:0%
um I would expect it would take two to
 
05:13:42.190 --> 05:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
three months to you know bring people
 
05:13:43.510 --> 05:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
into the house once you're up and
 
05:13:45.548 --> 05:13:45.558 align:start position:0%
running you can't get certified until
 
05:13:46.670 --> 05:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
you are up and
 
05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
running uh but again this a lot of the
 
05:13:51.150 --> 05:13:51.160 align:start position:0%
certification requirements go to the
 
05:13:56.110 --> 05:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
rules for running the house um there has
 
05:14:00.750 --> 05:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
to be zero drugs zero you know zero use
 
05:14:02.590 --> 05:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
of drugs or alcohol in the house that's
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
05:14:06.750 --> 05:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
requirements uh so the this this concern
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
about you know we're going to have
 
05:14:10.628 --> 05:14:10.638 align:start position:0%
people and it's the nimi concern we
 
05:14:12.430 --> 05:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
don't want that we don't want addicts
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
living on our road well these aren't
 
05:14:18.628 --> 05:14:18.638 align:start position:0%
people in addiction these are people in
 
05:14:18.638 --> 05:14:20.470 align:start position:0%
people in addiction these are people in
recovery

05:14:20.470 --> 05:14:20.480 align:start position:0%

this particular bill in this uh and this
 
05:14:58.910 --> 05:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
issue as a whole um I'm um someone in
 
05:15:03.150 --> 05:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
recovery uh got sober in
 
05:15:05.830 --> 05:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
2016 uh I'm a licensed realtor in the
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh I also am the
 
05:15:11.910 --> 05:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
owner of recovery residences in New
 
05:15:13.230 --> 05:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm also on the board of
 
05:15:15.430 --> 05:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
directors of the New Hampshire Coalition
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
of recovery
 
05:15:19.230 --> 05:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
residences uh I have been throughout
 
05:15:22.110 --> 05:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
this state um in front of many planning
 
05:15:24.270 --> 05:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
boards and in front of many zoning
 
05:15:26.868 --> 05:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
boards I've experienced the
 
05:15:31.470 --> 05:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
nimbyism that has risen to the level of
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
discriminatory I have seen many planning
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
and zoning boards looking for a solution
 
05:15:40.830 --> 05:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
and I see this bill as a solution
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
um what I see in this
 
05:15:44.400 --> 05:15:46.030 align:start position:0%
um what I see in this
bill

05:15:46.030 --> 05:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:15:51.230 --> 05:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
underlines 15 and 16 we identify a body
 
05:15:55.150 --> 05:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
we identify a certification body that
 
05:16:00.150 --> 05:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
knows what a safe ethically run recovery
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
residence should look like that's one
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
party I see in line 18 and 19 it
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
identifies a municipality that we have
 
05:16:12.430 --> 05:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
to provide notice to and in line 20 and
 
05:16:15.910 --> 05:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
21 I see a a State Fire Marshal and
 
05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
local fire marshall that will also uh
 
05:16:22.830 --> 05:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
get notice so I see three parties plus
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
the recovery residents I see all four
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
important stakeholders working
 
05:16:32.548 --> 05:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
together that has not been happening to
 
05:16:36.030 --> 05:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
date I see this bill bringing all
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together to make sure that
 
05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
a house uh is known and the house is
 
05:16:44.910 --> 05:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
running safely and
 
05:16:44.920 --> 05:16:47.270 align:start position:0%
running safely and
ethically

05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
ethically
 
05:16:51.510 --> 05:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
um I also see it clearly defining it uh
 
05:16:54.310 --> 05:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
a recovery house is non-transient in a
 
05:16:56.788 --> 05:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
residential use I know the question has
 
05:16:59.070 --> 05:16:59.080 align:start position:0%

home there's no business being done
 
05:17:15.590 --> 05:17:15.600 align:start position:0%

County government thank you madam chair

appreciate your detailed discussion and
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
uh I look forward to answering your
 
05:21:46.230 --> 05:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
questions HB 447 is
 
05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
um it's based on an update to RSA 72
 
05:21:50.520 --> 05:21:51.548 align:start position:0%
um it's based on an update to RSA 72
colon

05:21:51.548 --> 05:21:51.558 align:start position:0%
colon
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
36a and essentially uh we passed a law
 
05:21:58.590 --> 05:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
that said that disabled veterans were
 
05:22:00.270 --> 05:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
authorized to attack exemption at the
 
05:22:02.788 --> 05:22:02.798 align:start position:0%
local level and that law is currently in
 
05:22:05.310 --> 05:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
place what we have found though is that
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's a category of disabled veterans
 
05:22:10.110 --> 05:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
that are excluded from this law and
 
05:22:12.628 --> 05:22:12.638 align:start position:0%
essentially those excluded are excluded
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
because that the VA had had made changes
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
to their houses and and it just
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
technically didn't fit in and so what
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
we've done is we've added those disabled
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
veterans who are approved disabled
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
veterans through the normal process
 
05:22:31.830 --> 05:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's already in law and we've this law
 
05:22:35.910 --> 05:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
this bill would uh allow them the
 
05:22:38.110 --> 05:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans tax exemption that is
 
05:22:40.590 --> 05:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
already in existence so we don't change
 
05:22:43.470 --> 05:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
the disability requirements we don't
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
change the uh the rules associated with
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
administering this law all we do is say
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
that there are disabled veterans that
 
05:22:54.910 --> 05:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
are currently excluded and now we
 
05:22:58.110 --> 05:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
include them subject to any questions
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony Madam questions for
 
05:23:01.840 --> 05:23:03.270 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony Madam questions for
representative

05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:23:06.190 --> 05:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
kraton representative Gilman thank you
 
05:23:07.708 --> 05:23:07.718 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
05:23:09.230 --> 05:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:23:10.910 --> 05:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
if I understand you
 
05:23:14.510 --> 05:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
correctly the problem that this is
 
05:23:19.350 --> 05:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
fixing is uh this the loan or tax
 
05:23:19.360 --> 05:23:21.510 align:start position:0%
fixing is uh this the loan or tax
exemption

05:23:21.510 --> 05:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
05:23:24.070 --> 05:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
for things that have been provided by
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
the Veterans
 
05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
Administration as opposed
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
to things that have been modified
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
because the
 
05:23:35.310 --> 05:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
hospital the VA Hospital require or has
 
05:23:36.990 --> 05:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
recommended or requires that you have
 
05:23:41.150 --> 05:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
this help exactly and and in the bottom
 
05:23:42.830 --> 05:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
line it's the same situation it's just
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
about who fixed the house okay thank you
 
05:23:47.350 --> 05:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
and we're adding adding the other one in
 
05:23:49.470 --> 05:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
there good question thank you ma'am
 
05:23:49.480 --> 05:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
there good question thank you ma'am
further

05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:23:54.628 --> 05:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
questions I have a few questions yes
 
05:23:57.750 --> 05:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
ma'am so um just to clarify on lines
 
05:24:01.270 --> 05:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
seven and eight the the amended or added
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
languages or owns a home that is ADA
 
05:24:07.868 --> 05:24:07.878 align:start position:0%
Compliant and meets the needs of their
 
05:24:07.878 --> 05:24:09.030 align:start position:0%
Compliant and meets the needs of their
disability

05:24:09.030 --> 05:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
disability
 
05:24:13.070 --> 05:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am so does that imply that a
 
05:24:18.310 --> 05:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
veteran could um install a ramp at their
 
05:24:22.830 --> 05:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
residents because they are Mo they have
 
05:24:22.840 --> 05:24:24.190 align:start position:0%
residents because they are Mo they have
mobility

05:24:24.190 --> 05:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
mobility
 
05:24:26.990 --> 05:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
issues it does but they would also have
 
05:24:29.948 --> 05:24:29.958 align:start position:0%
they have that disabled veteran has to
 
05:24:32.670 --> 05:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
qualify under the current law so it
 
05:24:35.310 --> 05:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the qualification and so
 
05:24:37.670 --> 05:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
if that disability requires a ramp then
 
05:24:40.590 --> 05:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
yes that ramp could be added to the
 
05:24:43.350 --> 05:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
house could you clarify that I'm I'm
 
05:24:45.150 --> 05:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
conf because you're saying could you
 
05:24:47.110 --> 05:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
specifically point to what the
 
05:24:50.830 --> 05:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications are under this um section
 
05:24:54.390 --> 05:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
of yes ma'am it's under statute RSA 72
 
05:24:54.400 --> 05:24:57.030 align:start position:0%
of yes ma'am it's under statute RSA 72
colon

05:24:57.030 --> 05:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
295 and it's not written on the it's not
 
05:25:01.430 --> 05:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
written on the
 
05:25:04.110 --> 05:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
bill you see the colon at the end at the
 
05:25:06.030 --> 05:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
bottom there that's where it leads to
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
those exact qualifications um
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
my understanding with the reference to
 
05:25:15.708 --> 05:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
7229 V would be the definition of a
 
05:25:15.718 --> 05:25:17.150 align:start position:0%
7229 V would be the definition of a
surviving

05:25:17.150 --> 05:25:17.160 align:start position:0%
surviving
 
05:25:22.150 --> 05:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:22.160 --> 05:25:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
incorrect

05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
05:25:26.990 --> 05:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah okay fair
 
05:25:29.548 --> 05:25:29.558 align:start position:0%
enough the eligibility for the veteran
 
05:25:33.548 --> 05:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
50 on the top
 
05:25:41.830 --> 05:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
and okay I I will continue um I have a a
 
05:25:48.390 --> 05:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
followup question please are you aware
 
05:25:51.150 --> 05:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
of when this particular statute certain
 
05:25:52.990 --> 05:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans when was it last
 
05:25:55.628 --> 05:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
changed I I don't know
 
05:26:00.390 --> 05:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
ma'am okay that the answer would be last
 
05:26:00.400 --> 05:26:02.788 align:start position:0%
ma'am okay that the answer would be last
year

05:26:02.788 --> 05:26:02.798 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:26:02.798 --> 05:26:04.390 align:start position:0%
year
okay

05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:26:07.990 --> 05:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay but but the the issue remains
 
05:26:08.000 --> 05:26:09.990 align:start position:0%
yeah okay but but the the issue remains
that

05:26:09.990 --> 05:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:12.910 --> 05:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
um regardless of what it came into being
 
05:26:15.990 --> 05:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
there is a category of veterans that are
 
05:26:19.110 --> 05:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
that are excluded that should be
 
05:26:21.390 --> 05:26:21.400 align:start position:0%
included so the last thing that that I
 
05:26:25.830 --> 05:26:25.840 align:start position:0%

changed this law last year for the

was asked on a last testimony about the
 
05:28:37.360 --> 05:28:40.190 align:start position:0%
was asked on a last testimony about the
ramps

05:28:40.190 --> 05:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:43.708 --> 05:28:43.718 align:start position:0%
in the last 20 to 30 years
 
05:28:45.670 --> 05:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
houses throughout the state throughout
 
05:28:48.270 --> 05:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
the United States have had a lot of ADA
 
05:28:51.150 --> 05:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
Compliant things done it's currently in
 
05:28:53.868 --> 05:28:53.878 align:start position:0%
most building standards anymore so it's
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
a possible for a person to actually use
 
05:28:58.830 --> 05:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
their VA loan to go out and buy a house
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
that already has some ADA Compliant
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
issues in there now it does it meet all
 
05:29:04.830 --> 05:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
their requirements that they need for
 
05:29:08.350 --> 05:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
the disability it may it may not but
 
05:29:10.548 --> 05:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
then the VA through the Prosthetics
 
05:29:13.830 --> 05:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
clinic will come out through the primary
 
05:29:16.750 --> 05:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
care provider recommendation and do an
 
05:29:20.190 --> 05:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation of that home they will come
 
05:29:22.350 --> 05:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
physically look at the home and they
 
05:29:24.350 --> 05:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
will turn around and uh talk with the
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
veteran and they will make
 
05:29:28.110 --> 05:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations how to make it ADA
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
Compliant for that specific injury that
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
the veteran has they will go out and
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
hire a contractor the VA will they will
 
05:29:38.030 --> 05:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
have the contractor come out and provide
 
05:29:38.040 --> 05:29:39.708 align:start position:0%
have the contractor come out and provide
provide

05:29:39.708 --> 05:29:39.718 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
whatever um structure that needs to be
 
05:29:46.030 --> 05:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
changed on the home it's documented it's
 
05:29:47.788 --> 05:29:47.798 align:start position:0%
who's did it when he did it what time it
 
05:29:49.430 --> 05:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
was approved what date all the way down
 
05:29:51.150 --> 05:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
to what time of the day that they showed
 
05:29:52.750 --> 05:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
up and did the inspection and the day
 
05:29:55.708 --> 05:29:55.718 align:start position:0%
they did the modifications to the
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
home so when the question was asked
 
05:30:00.110 --> 05:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
earlier to me about well how does the
 
05:30:02.750 --> 05:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
assessor know about this it's easy when
 
05:30:04.670 --> 05:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
the veteran applies for this that letter
 
05:30:07.270 --> 05:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
to the VA says we did this to your home
 
05:30:09.310 --> 05:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
and this is what it's the modifications
 
05:30:10.990 --> 05:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we did to your bathroom or your
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
kitchen or whatever the case may be that
 
05:30:15.190 --> 05:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
is provided by the veteran to the
 
05:30:17.070 --> 05:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
selectman which I am a selectman of my
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
town and that's how why I brought this
 
05:30:21.868 --> 05:30:21.878 align:start position:0%
up because all that information is given
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
to us so we can provide it to the
 
05:30:26.590 --> 05:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
assessor so there is no question that
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
yes a ADA Compliant bathroom has been
 
05:30:30.868 --> 05:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
put in a special lift has been put into
 
05:30:32.948 --> 05:30:32.958 align:start position:0%
a bathroom a bedlift has been put into a
 
05:30:36.070 --> 05:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
bedroom whatever case that that veteran
 
05:30:39.708 --> 05:30:39.718 align:start position:0%
has but working with my Our Town
 
05:30:41.910 --> 05:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
assessor because it was new from last
 
05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
year I believe June or July of last year
 
05:30:45.948 --> 05:30:45.958 align:start position:0%
we wanted to make sure we're doing
 
05:30:47.990 --> 05:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
correct by our veterans so we asked our
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
assessor what do we do here we don't
 
05:30:51.510 --> 05:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
know we want to make sure we're doing
 
05:30:53.670 --> 05:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
this correctly our assessor went and
 
05:30:58.910 --> 05:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
talked to Mr William Gad which is the
 
05:31:00.270 --> 05:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Veterans
 
05:31:00.280 --> 05:31:01.708 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Veterans
Affairs

05:31:01.708 --> 05:31:01.718 align:start position:0%
Affairs
 
05:31:05.230 --> 05:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
director to get a his input we want to
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
make sure we're doing correct
 
05:31:10.270 --> 05:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
and they come back and said well if they
 
05:31:13.070 --> 05:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
don't have the representative sudor yes
 
05:31:15.390 --> 05:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
ma'am you're just about
 
05:31:18.430 --> 05:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
to State publicly something that
 
05:31:21.708 --> 05:31:21.718 align:start position:0%
somebody else said that would be hearsay
 
05:31:25.750 --> 05:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
so I have writing well you you're not
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
saying that okay but I would prefer that
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
you would stick to what you know okay
 
05:31:35.230 --> 05:31:35.240 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and that is your testimony
 
05:31:38.470 --> 05:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay so as the bill is written now
 
05:31:41.070 --> 05:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
if a veteran does not have an sah
 
05:31:41.080 --> 05:31:42.070 align:start position:0%
if a veteran does not have an sah
specific

05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:31:46.190 --> 05:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
Grant or an sh specific Grant which are
 
05:31:49.270 --> 05:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
made to either build or modify the home
 
05:31:51.750 --> 05:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
the veteran no matter how injured they
 
05:31:54.628 --> 05:31:54.638 align:start position:0%
are no matter how bad they are their
 
05:31:56.830 --> 05:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
condition they do not qualify to get
 
05:31:58.470 --> 05:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
this because they don't have those two
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
grants because they're specifically
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
named as that's what's qualifies so
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
we've forgotten the injury we forgotten
 
05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
everything that medically that person
 
05:32:09.270 --> 05:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
has a have when we've tied it to two
 
05:32:10.990 --> 05:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
grants when there's actually other
 
05:32:13.548 --> 05:32:13.558 align:start position:0%
grants out there and the VA Hospital
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
does this as well so if we add this
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
lettering in there all it shows is that
 
05:32:24.910 --> 05:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
a veteran who may be combined to a chair
 
05:32:27.390 --> 05:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
cannot walk maybe paraplegic maybe
 
05:32:29.788 --> 05:32:29.798 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be God bless
 
05:32:32.470 --> 05:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
them that the VA has come out and modify
 
05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
their homes as well the medical doesn't
 
05:32:36.270 --> 05:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
change nothing changes in the law all
 
05:32:38.830 --> 05:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
this is doing is just saying
 
05:32:42.110 --> 05:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
we paid out of a different pot for the
 
05:32:42.120 --> 05:32:44.470 align:start position:0%
we paid out of a different pot for the
same

05:32:44.470 --> 05:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:46.510 --> 05:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
modifications any
 
05:32:50.628 --> 05:32:50.638 align:start position:0%
questions questions for representative
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
suder hope I said it right see seeing
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
none I I do have a question so I asked
 
05:33:00.150 --> 05:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and so I just want to
 
05:33:03.270 --> 05:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
understand is it possible that a veteran
 
05:33:05.590 --> 05:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
who has mobility issues and needs
 
05:33:08.830 --> 05:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
assistance with say a cane
 
05:33:14.470 --> 05:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
um has a ramp installed in in at their
 
05:33:17.070 --> 05:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
residence I it's a two-part question and
 
05:33:20.230 --> 05:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
so the ramp uh would meet the needs of
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
their disability who assesses that this
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
particular ramp is meeting that need
 
05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
that that is number one so just answer
 
05:33:32.430 --> 05:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you can answer that and then I'll
 
05:33:34.708 --> 05:33:34.718 align:start position:0%
follow up again when the primary care
 
05:33:36.990 --> 05:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
physician represents this to the
 
05:33:39.070 --> 05:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
Prosthetics Clinic at the VA Hospital
 
05:33:40.868 --> 05:33:40.878 align:start position:0%
right here in Manchester they sent a
 
05:33:42.990 --> 05:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
technician out the technician has a list
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
of all your
 
05:33:47.310 --> 05:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities the technician will go over
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
your home and see what you need in order
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
to make that home livable for you if
 
05:33:54.590 --> 05:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
they determine that's a ramp is needed
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
they will specifically say why the ramp
 
05:33:58.670 --> 05:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
is needed it's not just oh we wanted to
 
05:34:00.190 --> 05:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
put a ramp on our house cuz he walk was
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
a cane specifically why it has to be
 
05:34:04.830 --> 05:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
there it has to be documented once
 
05:34:06.510 --> 05:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
that's documented then it's sent back to
 
05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
the Prosthetics Clinic
 
05:34:10.110 --> 05:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
they sign off on it and they hire a
 
05:34:11.628 --> 05:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
contractor to come out and stall the
 
05:34:18.270 --> 05:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
house okay so my my second question
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
would be with regards to to you know
 
05:34:24.160 --> 05:34:25.708 align:start position:0%
would be with regards to to you know
this

05:34:25.708 --> 05:34:25.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:34:29.230 --> 05:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
veteran having an ADA Compliant ramp
 
05:34:32.150 --> 05:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
installed to meet their needs is it
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
possible that this particular
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
individual is full is fully employed no
 
05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
the medical requirements stays the same
 
05:34:43.708 --> 05:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
they have to be 100% disabled
 
05:34:46.030 --> 05:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
unemployable that does not change they
 
05:34:48.150 --> 05:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
have to be these are people who can't
 
05:34:51.470 --> 05:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
work these aren't people that are you
 
05:34:53.910 --> 05:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
know a disabled veteran that got bad
 
05:34:55.230 --> 05:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
knees from falling out of airplanes like
 
05:34:57.270 --> 05:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
I did for too many years these are
 
05:34:59.628 --> 05:34:59.638 align:start position:0%
people that are you know severely
 
05:35:02.070 --> 05:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
injured so it it they have that the
 
05:35:03.788 --> 05:35:03.798 align:start position:0%
medical requirements that's already in
 
05:35:08.990 --> 05:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:09.000 --> 05:35:10.750 align:start position:0%
 
further

05:35:10.750 --> 05:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:35:18.390 --> 05:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
you and the the final pink card for this
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
bill is from M Melinda Sims so the chair
 
05:35:36.150 --> 05:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:40.548 --> 05:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:54.990 --> 05:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:01.190 --> 05:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:05.990 --> 05:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
all and I'm a a disabled veteran uh
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
total impermanent
 
05:36:12.310 --> 05:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
100% and tdiu which means
 
05:36:14.670 --> 05:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
unemployable uh from a spinal cord
 
05:36:17.830 --> 05:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
injury that I incurred in the military
 
05:36:20.910 --> 05:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
I'm also um the advocacy coordinator for
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
United spinal Association uh New
 
05:36:27.910 --> 05:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire chapter and we are an advocacy
 
05:36:31.150 --> 05:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
a grassroot advocacy group that works on
 
05:36:35.190 --> 05:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
issues like um accessible housing
 
05:36:38.110 --> 05:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
parking transportation
 
05:36:41.948 --> 05:36:41.958 align:start position:0%
emergency process so on I'm speaking to
 
05:36:45.548 --> 05:36:45.558 align:start position:0%
you today about HB 447 relative to
 
05:36:47.430 --> 05:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
property tax exemption for disabled
 
05:36:52.230 --> 05:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
veterans I'm opposed to this because um
 
05:36:54.548 --> 05:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
while I strongly support tax relief for
 
05:36:56.708 --> 05:36:56.718 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans I have identified
 
05:36:58.510 --> 05:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
several technical concerns with the
 
05:37:00.830 --> 05:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
Bill's current language that requires
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
your attention the current law RSA 7236
 
05:37:07.548 --> 05:37:07.558 align:start position:0%
a requires veterans to meet two specific
 
05:37:10.708 --> 05:37:10.718 align:start position:0%
specific criteria for this tax one is to
 
05:37:12.910 --> 05:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
have a qualifying severe disability
 
05:37:16.750 --> 05:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
which is 100% total disability be a
 
05:37:19.708 --> 05:37:19.718 align:start position:0%
double ampute paraplegic or have a
 
05:37:23.150 --> 05:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
service connected blindness rating and
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
have a home modified through the VA
 
05:37:28.750 --> 05:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
special adapted housing SA or special
 
05:37:32.868 --> 05:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
home adapted grants sha or purchased
 
05:37:35.270 --> 05:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
using proceeds from selling such
 
05:37:37.868 --> 05:37:37.878 align:start position:0%
modified home the proposed bill would
 
05:37:41.470 --> 05:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
add two new ways to qualify having an
 
05:37:46.030 --> 05:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
ADA Compliant home or a modified through
 
05:37:49.510 --> 05:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
the VA hospital system this creates
 
05:37:49.520 --> 05:37:50.788 align:start position:0%
the VA hospital system this creates
several

05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
several
 
05:37:53.788 --> 05:37:53.798 align:start position:0%
concerns the reference to VA Hospital
 
05:37:57.708 --> 05:37:57.718 align:start position:0%
System modification appears to mean hisa
 
05:37:57.718 --> 05:37:58.830 align:start position:0%
System modification appears to mean hisa
Grant

05:37:58.830 --> 05:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
hisa uh I I gave you all a really nice
 
05:38:05.590 --> 05:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
packet that explains a lot of this um
 
05:38:08.990 --> 05:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
however hisa grants have very different
 
05:38:11.070 --> 05:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
requirements they're available to
 
05:38:13.670 --> 05:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
Veterans with disability ratings as low
 
05:38:13.680 --> 05:38:14.510 align:start position:0%
Veterans with disability ratings as low
as

05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:38:18.670 --> 05:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
50% and can be used for non-service
 
05:38:21.628 --> 05:38:21.638 align:start position:0%
conditions this is substantially
 
05:38:23.510 --> 05:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
different from the current requirements
 
05:38:26.190 --> 05:38:26.200 align:start position:0%
of 100% permanent and total
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
disability here's a critical scenario to
 
05:38:32.948 --> 05:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
consider under title 38 USC chapter 21
 
05:38:35.190 --> 05:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
veterans with severe disabilities like
 
05:38:38.350 --> 05:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
loss of both lower extremities blindness
 
05:38:40.628 --> 05:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
plus loss of one lower extremity or
 
05:38:43.270 --> 05:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
other qualifying conditions are eligible
 
05:38:46.270 --> 05:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
for Sasha grants however some of these
 
05:38:49.628 --> 05:38:49.638 align:start position:0%
veterans may not need such extensive
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
modifications their service connected
 
05:38:54.070 --> 05:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities might be better served by
 
05:38:57.990 --> 05:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
simpler ADA compliance measures or hisa
 
05:39:00.670 --> 05:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
modifications under the current law
 
05:39:02.468 --> 05:39:02.478 align:start position:0%
these veterans despite having
 
05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
disabilities severe enough to qualify
 
05:39:07.830 --> 05:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
for Sasha grants would not qu qualify
 
05:39:10.628 --> 05:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
for the tax exemption simply because
 
05:39:12.670 --> 05:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
they chose more appropriate less
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
extensive modifications for their
 
05:39:17.990 --> 05:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
specific needs for example a veteran who
 
05:39:20.750 --> 05:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
has lost both lower extremities and
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
qualifies for some might only need a
 
05:39:25.390 --> 05:39:25.400 align:start position:0%
wheelchair ramp and a bathroom
 
05:39:27.190 --> 05:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
modification rather than the
 
05:39:30.030 --> 05:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive structural changes by
 
05:39:33.468 --> 05:39:33.478 align:start position:0%
Sasha grants despite having a qualifying
 
05:39:36.030 --> 05:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
severe disability if they don't use the
 
05:39:39.468 --> 05:39:39.478 align:start position:0%
Sasha Grant program they cannot get the
 
05:39:42.788 --> 05:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
tax exemption under the current law even
 
05:39:44.750 --> 05:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
though they have the same level of
 
05:39:47.150 --> 05:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
disability as someone who does not use
 
05:39:51.708 --> 05:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
the Sasha M so what I'm recommending is
 
05:39:53.590 --> 05:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining the current severe
 
05:39:55.868 --> 05:39:55.878 align:start position:0%
disability qualification
 
05:39:58.910 --> 05:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
requirements expanding the modification
 
05:40:02.230 --> 05:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
options to include ADA compliance or
 
05:40:06.030 --> 05:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
hisa grants but only to Veterans who
 
05:40:08.150 --> 05:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
first meet the severe disability
 
05:40:10.670 --> 05:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that would qualify them for
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
the Sasha Grant so this current bill
 
05:40:16.830 --> 05:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
would would not specify that and it
 
05:40:20.310 --> 05:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be requiring proof that the
 
05:40:23.350 --> 05:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
modifications add address their service
 
05:40:27.468 --> 05:40:27.478 align:start position:0%
connected disability needs so meaning um
 
05:40:29.390 --> 05:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy coming out and
 
05:40:32.230 --> 05:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
addressing so as currently written I
 
05:40:35.468 --> 05:40:35.478 align:start position:0%
cannot support HB 447 due to the
 
05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
technical issues I've outlined
 
05:40:40.030 --> 05:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
however if amended to maintain the
 
05:40:42.150 --> 05:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
current disability thresholds while
 
05:40:45.270 --> 05:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
allowing additional modification options
 
05:40:48.270 --> 05:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
for those who meet the stri these strict
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
requirements I would fully support this
 
05:40:53.830 --> 05:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
legislation such changes would preserve
 
05:40:55.910 --> 05:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
the original intent of supporting our
 
05:40:58.350 --> 05:40:58.360 align:start position:0%
most severely disabled veterans while
 
05:41:00.990 --> 05:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
giving them more flexibility to choose
 
05:41:03.910 --> 05:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
modifications the best suits their P
 
05:41:06.070 --> 05:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
specific needs thank you for your time
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
05:41:11.310 --> 05:41:11.320 align:start position:0%

05:41:11.320 --> 05:41:12.468 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony Miss Sims

concerns I would I would
 
05:41:27.200 --> 05:41:30.510 align:start position:0%
concerns I would I would
highlight

05:41:30.510 --> 05:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
um well
 
05:41:36.628 --> 05:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
in oops let me get back to my page good
 
05:41:36.638 --> 05:41:38.830 align:start position:0%
in oops let me get back to my page good
question

05:41:38.830 --> 05:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:41:40.548 --> 05:41:40.558 align:start position:0%
I think I would put the the
 
05:41:43.430 --> 05:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations that I have like where
 
05:41:46.350 --> 05:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
it says that the person would need to
 
05:41:49.190 --> 05:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
meet the the rag
 
05:41:53.030 --> 05:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
38 um the
 
05:41:53.040 --> 05:41:55.430 align:start position:0%
38 um the
38

05:41:55.430 --> 05:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
38
 
05:41:59.230 --> 05:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
CR uh here it is 38 USC chapter 21 they
 
05:42:03.070 --> 05:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
would need to meet that and be able to
 
05:42:08.390 --> 05:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
um be eligible for the Sasha grants uh
 
05:42:08.400 --> 05:42:10.190 align:start position:0%
um be eligible for the Sasha grants uh
there

05:42:10.190 --> 05:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:42:13.310 --> 05:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
is information here that tells about the
 
05:42:15.150 --> 05:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
Sasha Grant in the form that they would
 
05:42:17.670 --> 05:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
need to complete so if they would
 
05:42:20.670 --> 05:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
complete that form and show eligibility
 
05:42:23.150 --> 05:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
and you can get that right off of their
 
05:42:26.948 --> 05:42:26.958 align:start position:0%
eligibility letter so if they can prove
 
05:42:29.590 --> 05:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
that that they are eligible for the
 
05:42:33.070 --> 05:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
Sasha then that also proves that of
 
05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:41.230 --> 05:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
answer to a additional questions a
 
05:42:41.240 --> 05:42:43.350 align:start position:0%
answer to a additional questions a
followup

05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:42:46.548 --> 05:42:46.558 align:start position:0%
quickly that was very confusing to me as
 
05:42:50.670 --> 05:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
a lay person so if if you could suggest
 
05:42:53.670 --> 05:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
actual legislative language absolutely I
 
05:42:54.990 --> 05:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
um and send it the committee that would
 
05:42:57.270 --> 05:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
be helpful thank you absolutely thank
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
you further
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
questions I had a did I see a hand over
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
there no so I do I have a quick question
 
05:43:09.670 --> 05:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
so you you were one of your suggested
 
05:43:13.628 --> 05:43:13.638 align:start position:0%
revisions was um had to do with to an
 
05:43:15.948 --> 05:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
applicant should be able to be eligible
 
05:43:21.788 --> 05:43:21.798 align:start position:0%
for the SAA s or sha grants is it true
 
05:43:24.990 --> 05:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
that in for for any
 
05:43:28.270 --> 05:43:28.280 align:start position:0%
Grant in order to determine eligibility
 
05:43:30.590 --> 05:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
then an an individual would have to fill
 
05:43:33.310 --> 05:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
out the application provide supporting
 
05:43:35.468 --> 05:43:35.478 align:start position:0%
documentation and then that Grant in
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
that application would need to be
 
05:43:41.150 --> 05:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
evaluated by some party to determine El
 
05:43:44.270 --> 05:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility absolutely so that they have
 
05:43:47.948 --> 05:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
to be first off they have to meet the 38
 
05:43:51.830 --> 05:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh CFR reg um 100 no I I'm going to
 
05:43:55.070 --> 05:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
interject I understand that my point is
 
05:43:58.990 --> 05:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
is it's unclear as to who would um
 
05:44:03.270 --> 05:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
evaluate the application so while it's
 
05:44:07.390 --> 05:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
in it's it's a it's a little deficient
 
05:44:10.910 --> 05:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
just my point I don't know
 
05:44:15.110 --> 05:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
who this is an RSA
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
so I don't know who would determine the
 
05:44:22.230 --> 05:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility based on your suggestion so
 
05:44:24.190 --> 05:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
there is a determining body for the
 
05:44:28.230 --> 05:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
Sasha Grant they are they are a specific
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
body for that the applicant fills out
 
05:44:34.070 --> 05:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
the application puts it in and then they
 
05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
will determine whether the person is is
 
05:44:39.990 --> 05:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
eligible eligible for that or not as far
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
as uh like if they need a ramp or
 
05:44:44.670 --> 05:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
something in the home that's all through
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
PT like uh representative sudder had
 
05:44:50.070 --> 05:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
suggested did that answer your question
 
05:44:53.070 --> 05:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
yes it does thank you further
 
05:44:55.310 --> 05:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:44:59.510 --> 05:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:02.750 --> 05:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
all we had one additional pink card
 
05:45:07.830 --> 05:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
manifest and that was from Mr Brody Dees
 
05:45:10.190 --> 05:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
welcome back to Municipal and County
 
05:45:12.230 --> 05:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
government thank you madam chairwoman
 
05:45:13.390 --> 05:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you to the committee I'll
 
05:45:16.868 --> 05:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
be extremely brief um we were contacted
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
by a few assessors that had concerns and
 
05:45:20.990 --> 05:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
some of their concerns were actually
 
05:45:23.468 --> 05:45:23.478 align:start position:0%
raised today by members of the committee
 
05:45:25.830 --> 05:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
and that is um how exactly to keep track
 
05:45:29.430 --> 05:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
of these um these upgrades or different
 
05:45:31.948 --> 05:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
changes to the dwellings or to the homes
 
05:45:34.310 --> 05:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
to the residential homes um to keep
 
05:45:37.110 --> 05:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
track of you know for this tax exemption
 
05:45:40.150 --> 05:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
and um we think just a slight
 
05:45:42.750 --> 05:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
modification to the existing statute uh
 
05:45:45.350 --> 05:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
specifically 72 colon
 
05:45:48.350 --> 05:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
36-a Roman 2 where it says satisfactory
 
05:45:50.430 --> 05:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
proof of such service connection
 
05:45:52.788 --> 05:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
disability is furnished to the assessors
 
05:45:54.990 --> 05:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
if just at and that's not in the bill
 
05:45:56.990 --> 05:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
that's in the statute it's the section
 
05:45:59.190 --> 05:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
there's a Roman one and a Roman two
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
below the um what is currently being
 
05:46:04.070 --> 05:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
modified in the bill and um we think if
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
if it was more clear what would be
 
05:46:09.990 --> 05:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
provided to the assessors to verify um
 
05:46:13.468 --> 05:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the specific um ADA
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
Compliant and meets the needs of the
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
disability or modifications from the VA
 
05:46:18.468 --> 05:46:18.478 align:start position:0%
hospital system that there might be a
 
05:46:20.948 --> 05:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
way to work with um the Veterans Affairs
 
05:46:23.310 --> 05:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
folks and other uh stakeholders be able
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
to find out what is the best paperwork
 
05:46:27.628 --> 05:46:27.638 align:start position:0%
that assessors should be requesting so
 
05:46:30.270 --> 05:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
they can verify um this you know they
 
05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
can verify for the tax exemption statute
 
05:46:34.628 --> 05:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
and um I'll answer any questions but I
 
05:46:35.788 --> 05:46:35.798 align:start position:0%

session

05:48:35.708 --> 05:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:35.718 --> 05:49:05.708 align:start position:0%

05:50:33.510 --> 05:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
into executive session we were
 
05:50:36.510 --> 05:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
tentatively scheduled to commence this
 
05:50:39.910 --> 05:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
um uh around two and we are behind I
 
05:50:42.150 --> 05:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
05:50:46.750 --> 05:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
um notify the committee that
 
05:50:50.150 --> 05:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
we we need to
 
05:50:53.310 --> 05:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
ideally complete our work here by 5:00
 
05:50:55.868 --> 05:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
p.m if we do need to extend beyond 5:00
 
05:50:58.628 --> 05:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
pm I'm going to need to take a short
 
05:51:01.628 --> 05:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
break and I need to c contact house
 
05:51:04.590 --> 05:51:04.600 align:start position:0%
committee services so they can do what
 
05:51:06.270 --> 05:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
they need to do because that would be
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
after hours for for the staff so just
 
05:51:33.430 --> 05:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
possible representative Murphy
 
05:51:38.590 --> 05:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
would you be better off asking for
 
05:51:38.600 --> 05:51:39.910 align:start position:0%
would you be better off asking for
permission

05:51:39.910 --> 05:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
permission
 
05:51:39.920 --> 05:51:49.670 align:start position:0%
permission
now

05:51:49.670 --> 05:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:53.190 --> 05:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
no that they're they're watching so
 
05:51:56.510 --> 05:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
they're somebody's watching so they're
 
05:52:00.310 --> 05:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
seeing how long this is taking
 
05:52:00.320 --> 05:52:03.468 align:start position:0%
seeing how long this is taking
so

05:52:03.468 --> 05:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah the reason I said that I probably
 
05:52:07.670 --> 05:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
didn't say it very very well but you
 
05:52:10.830 --> 05:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
know when we're getting close to five
 
05:52:13.628 --> 05:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
they'll be somewhat aware but I need to
 
05:52:24.750 --> 05:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:27.430 --> 05:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
that so I'm just giving the clerk some
 
05:52:29.430 --> 05:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
time to get organized and then then
 
05:52:29.440 --> 05:52:35.430 align:start position:0%
time to get organized and then then
we'll

05:52:35.430 --> 05:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:18.708 --> 05:53:18.718 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion thank you madam
 
05:54:14.110 --> 05:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
chairwoman yes um uh one of the main
 
05:54:15.468 --> 05:54:15.478 align:start position:0%
object well it's not really an objection
 
05:54:17.230 --> 05:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
to this bill we recognize that state
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
statute uh pulls out the major holidays
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
for the state there's nothing that says
 
05:54:25.548 --> 05:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
you cannot add um to the title of any
 
05:54:28.190 --> 05:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
one of these in any of your Publications
 
05:54:29.990 --> 05:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
as long as you have the major holidays
 
05:54:31.788 --> 05:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
listed in that publication so there's no
 
05:54:34.070 --> 05:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
reason why you can't say that Columbus
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
Day could also be indigenous people day
 
05:54:38.230 --> 05:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
and for those reasons since you there's
 
05:54:40.670 --> 05:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
no prohibition on adding uh we don't see
 
05:54:41.948 --> 05:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
why this bill is
 
05:54:41.958 --> 05:54:48.390 align:start position:0%

05:59:31.590 --> 05:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
May doesn't have to if if a town wants

further discussion representative Gerard
 
05:59:44.670 --> 05:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I respect the
 
05:59:46.390 --> 05:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts of the representative that just
 
05:59:49.270 --> 05:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
spoke this appears to be one community
 
05:59:51.750 --> 05:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
that has this issue uh as we know we had
 
05:59:53.788 --> 05:59:53.798 align:start position:0%
one community that did show up and if
 
05:59:55.468 --> 05:59:55.478 align:start position:0%
you look at the irsa the way it's
 
05:59:57.868 --> 05:59:57.878 align:start position:0%
currently written uh the it talks about
 
05:59:59.628 --> 05:59:59.638 align:start position:0%
making the bylaws relating to Regulation
 
06:00:01.510 --> 06:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
and Licensing the motor vehicle
 
06:00:04.350 --> 06:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
racetracks and this was done as a
 
06:00:06.910 --> 06:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
one-time thing ahead of time where which
 
06:00:08.830 --> 06:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
is why the racetrack that was here last
 
06:00:11.350 --> 06:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
week spoke that they basically every
 
06:00:13.310 --> 06:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
year um they know that they're going to
 
06:00:15.190 --> 06:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
have so many dates so many hours they
 
06:00:15.200 --> 06:00:16.030 align:start position:0%
have so many dates so many hours they
can

06:00:16.030 --> 06:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
can
 
06:00:19.390 --> 06:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
operate the $100 is basically for the
 
06:00:22.110 --> 06:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
annual operation of the racetrack which
 
06:00:23.750 --> 06:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
when they give the annual operation of
 
06:00:25.990 --> 06:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
the racetrack at that point they usually
 
06:00:29.390 --> 06:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
go in with their uh schedule of events
 
06:00:31.788 --> 06:00:31.798 align:start position:0%
and what dates they want to operate
 
06:00:33.628 --> 06:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
Certificate of Insurance and then it's
 
06:00:36.230 --> 06:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
usually approved by the local Comm
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
Community I understand we heard from the
 
06:00:40.948 --> 06:00:40.958 align:start position:0%
town that stated that they felt like
 
06:00:42.830 --> 06:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
they had approximately 8 hours into each
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
of the different facilities and they
 
06:00:46.350 --> 06:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
felt as though that was a draw on the
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
local community from a budgetary
 
06:00:50.910 --> 06:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint I took the time to look at
 
06:00:53.030 --> 06:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
the town of eping as an example where
 
06:00:55.670 --> 06:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
they do have their two facilities there
 
06:01:00.230 --> 06:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
and based upon the town of eeping
 
06:01:03.350 --> 06:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
the the amount of taxes that the two
 
06:01:05.910 --> 06:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
facilities are are currently licensed in
 
06:01:08.390 --> 06:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
in that Community are paying they're
 
06:01:08.400 --> 06:01:10.110 align:start position:0%
in that Community are paying they're
paying

06:01:10.110 --> 06:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
paying
 
06:01:12.590 --> 06:01:12.600 align:start position:0%
$131,000 a year based upon what their
 
06:01:14.708 --> 06:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
assessments are and what the state uh
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
listing is on their RSA or on their
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
Dr from a municipal standpoint they're
 
06:01:25.190 --> 06:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
paying almost $29,000 a year in taxes to
 
06:01:27.830 --> 06:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
that Community it's actually 28 946 is
 
06:01:30.910 --> 06:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
what I come up with they on top of that
 
06:01:32.390 --> 06:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're paying nearly
 
06:01:35.948 --> 06:01:35.958 align:start position:0%
$98,000 in educational taxes
 
06:01:37.708 --> 06:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
so when we start talking about how it
 
06:01:40.628 --> 06:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
affects the local community these these
 
06:01:43.270 --> 06:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
RAC trcks are actually uh positive to
 
06:01:45.750 --> 06:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
the local community and I think by
 
06:01:47.990 --> 06:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
asking them to pay an extra $400 a year
 
06:01:50.230 --> 06:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
or up to extra $400 a year I just think
 
06:01:54.150 --> 06:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate because not only are
 
06:01:56.350 --> 06:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
they not getting anything for their
 
06:01:58.230 --> 06:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
education piece they understand that
 
06:01:59.590 --> 06:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's part of the process but what
 
06:02:01.310 --> 06:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
would that additional cost be on the
 
06:02:04.468 --> 06:02:04.478 align:start position:0%
local community if if they didn't have
 
06:02:06.510 --> 06:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
those facilities in there
 
06:02:08.230 --> 06:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
and again when you look through there
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
are approximately another dozen uh
 
06:02:14.350 --> 06:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
communities that have racetracks in them
 
06:02:16.030 --> 06:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
and not one of them was here to speak
 
06:02:18.510 --> 06:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
out on behalf
 
06:02:20.548 --> 06:02:20.558 align:start position:0%

06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%

discussion seeing
 
06:02:37.708 --> 06:02:37.718 align:start position:0%
none so the motion the motion before us
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%

funding provided to municipalities after

06:05:47.948 --> 06:05:47.958 align:start position:0%
disaster um representative France is
 
06:05:50.390 --> 06:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
recognized for a motion I'd like to make
 
06:05:54.510 --> 06:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
a motion on HB 165 is ought to pass
 
06:05:57.510 --> 06:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a second a second
 
06:06:00.788 --> 06:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
that representative Murphy second that
 
06:06:02.750 --> 06:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
06:06:06.590 --> 06:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
motion representative France
 
06:06:09.510 --> 06:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
well based on testimony I think the
 
06:06:13.990 --> 06:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
$25,000 limit is very old outdated it it
 
06:06:16.910 --> 06:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
really doesn't cover uh any kind of
 
06:06:19.350 --> 06:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
relief for the municipalities and the
 
06:06:23.270 --> 06:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:31.230 --> 06:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:33.830 --> 06:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Gerard thank
 
06:06:36.150 --> 06:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
you mad chair the other piece that it
 
06:06:38.150 --> 06:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually adds to it as well is the fact
 
06:06:39.670 --> 06:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
that we're correcting the language so
 
06:06:41.110 --> 06:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
that way the homeland security
 
06:06:43.110 --> 06:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion of making sure this grant
 
06:06:45.110 --> 06:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect other grants as well
 
06:06:46.468 --> 06:06:46.478 align:start position:0%
which I think is a very important part
 
06:06:50.030 --> 06:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill as well
 
06:06:55.350 --> 06:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:59.310 --> 06:06:59.320 align:start position:0%

06:10:18.070 --> 06:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
article the chair recognizes
 
06:10:20.670 --> 06:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy for a motion I

representative Murphy yes what they will
 
06:10:35.868 --> 06:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
do I believe
 
06:10:38.990 --> 06:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of the uh problems like the 2C
 
06:10:42.150 --> 06:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
or to put everything to uh to study it
 
06:10:44.750 --> 06:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be more clear and and precise you
 
06:10:46.390 --> 06:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
can still change the dollar amount of
 
06:10:48.070 --> 06:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
the warrant article but you won't be
 
06:10:53.430 --> 06:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:57.670 --> 06:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
comments representative majori thank you
 
06:11:03.750 --> 06:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman and I I find it uh hard
 
06:11:05.510 --> 06:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
that I might disagree with my friend who
 
06:11:07.948 --> 06:11:07.958 align:start position:0%
is a moderator but I I will just say
 
06:11:10.190 --> 06:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
respectfully that I I disagree with the
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
Au to pass motion and and would favor
 
06:11:13.670 --> 06:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
itl because I think what's Happening
 
06:11:15.708 --> 06:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
Here is you're creating a second class
 
06:11:18.750 --> 06:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
of or a second I guess class is the word
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
of Warrant articles where now you you
 
06:11:24.788 --> 06:11:24.798 align:start position:0%
can't change the purpose of these others
 
06:11:27.910 --> 06:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
can be changed um so I think what you're
 
06:11:30.590 --> 06:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
doing is is you're creating confusion
 
06:11:33.830 --> 06:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
here uh for the voters um so I I think
 
06:11:35.910 --> 06:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
the way the language exist in statute
 
06:11:38.510 --> 06:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
right now is good and I don't see the
 
06:11:41.350 --> 06:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
need for this change thank
 
06:11:45.868 --> 06:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
you additional comments representative
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair I also
 
06:11:51.190 --> 06:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
would support a motion of itl on this
 
06:11:55.110 --> 06:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
bill mainly because I find the
 
06:11:58.190 --> 06:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
presumption that any amendment to a
 
06:12:00.830 --> 06:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
warrant article is uh somehow a
 
06:12:03.468 --> 06:12:03.478 align:start position:0%
subjugation of the will of the voters
 
06:12:06.548 --> 06:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
and I think that the word in tent is
 
06:12:09.150 --> 06:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
extremely vague and could be interpreted
 
06:12:11.910 --> 06:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
in any number of ways and as I seem to
 
06:12:15.070 --> 06:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
recall that there was quite a bit of
 
06:12:17.670 --> 06:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
questioning um on our Republican
 
06:12:19.910 --> 06:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
colleague side about the fact that it
 
06:12:23.670 --> 06:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
was confusing and um open to
 
06:12:26.070 --> 06:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation thank
 
06:12:36.750 --> 06:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:39.110 --> 06:12:39.120 align:start position:0%

to8 representative stavis
 
06:27:07.868 --> 06:27:07.878 align:start position:0%
I have a question so on a retain motion
 
06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
is that reported on the house calendar
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
or is that just retained in committee I
 
06:27:14.468 --> 06:27:14.478 align:start position:0%
believe it's simply retained so there
 
06:27:17.310 --> 06:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
will be no uh reports that's what I
 
06:27:19.590 --> 06:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
thought thank
 
06:27:19.600 --> 06:27:21.350 align:start position:0%

would as you see uh on article
 
06:28:50.868 --> 06:28:50.878 align:start position:0%
two number b or letter
 
06:28:53.310 --> 06:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
B the criteria for determining
 
06:28:55.590 --> 06:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility for general assistance which
 
06:28:57.670 --> 06:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
may require an individual to provide
 
06:29:00.150 --> 06:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
proof of residency prior to being
 
06:29:01.750 --> 06:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
approved for such
 
06:29:04.750 --> 06:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
assistance acceptable evidence of an
 
06:29:06.788 --> 06:29:06.798 align:start position:0%
individual's residence may include a
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
lease car registration utility bill or
 
06:29:11.750 --> 06:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
any governmen issued document with an
 
06:29:14.990 --> 06:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
address matching the stated
 
06:29:19.788 --> 06:29:19.798 align:start position:0%
residents uh previous Bill had a
 
06:29:19.798 --> 06:29:23.150 align:start position:0%
residents uh previous Bill had a
90day

06:29:23.150 --> 06:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:27.350 --> 06:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh requirement on their time limit thank
 
06:29:30.548 --> 06:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
you under that section also number one
 
06:29:33.270 --> 06:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
special consideration may be provided to
 
06:29:35.110 --> 06:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
non-residents who have left their town
 
06:29:37.788 --> 06:29:37.798 align:start position:0%
of origin due to domestic violence
 
06:29:41.910 --> 06:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
stalking sexual assault or human
 
06:29:44.030 --> 06:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
trafficking I think that answers the
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
question that we heard in the uh public
 
06:29:50.430 --> 06:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
hearing subsection two the governing
 
06:29:52.990 --> 06:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
body May at its discretion authorize the
 
06:29:54.750 --> 06:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
local assistance administrator to
 
06:29:57.230 --> 06:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
provide emergency assistance to a
 
06:29:59.910 --> 06:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
non-resident for up to 72 hours to allow
 
06:30:02.948 --> 06:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
the applicate to allow application and
 
06:30:05.110 --> 06:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
communication coordination with the town
 
06:30:05.120 --> 06:30:06.070 align:start position:0%
communication coordination with the town
of

06:30:06.070 --> 06:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:30:08.590 --> 06:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
origin again this answers some of the
 
06:30:11.628 --> 06:30:11.638 align:start position:0%
concerns raised at our public hearing
 
06:30:14.390 --> 06:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
about emergency uh
 
06:30:17.430 --> 06:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
assistance and
 
06:30:19.628 --> 06:30:19.638 align:start position:0%
then letter
 
06:30:22.350 --> 06:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
F is being added a monthly local
 
06:30:25.030 --> 06:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
assistance limit of not less than 50% of
 
06:30:28.430 --> 06:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:30.868 --> 06:30:30.878 align:start position:0%
level if you go back up to Roman numeral
 
06:30:34.670 --> 06:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
2 the last uh sentence say the guidelin
 
06:30:37.948 --> 06:30:37.958 align:start position:0%
shall include but not be limited to the
 
06:30:40.350 --> 06:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
following so F makes sense with a
 
06:30:42.270 --> 06:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
monthly local assistance limit of not
 
06:30:45.830 --> 06:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
less than 50% of the federal poverty
 
06:30:48.310 --> 06:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
level and I think
 
06:30:51.468 --> 06:30:51.478 align:start position:0%
that would help protect the
 
06:30:54.990 --> 06:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that in my town of Swansea
 
06:30:56.670 --> 06:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
we've seen our
 
06:31:00.350 --> 06:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh general assistance budget go from
 
06:31:05.350 --> 06:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
77,000 three years ago to 224 4,000 last
 
06:31:07.788 --> 06:31:07.798 align:start position:0%
year and with what's going on in
 
06:31:09.510 --> 06:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
neighboring states I think this is going
 
06:31:12.430 --> 06:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
to be an ongoing problem that uh we need
 
06:31:14.708 --> 06:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
to do something about
 
06:31:18.190 --> 06:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
now thank you all yield any
 
06:31:21.468 --> 06:31:21.478 align:start position:0%
questions further discussion on the
 
06:31:24.070 --> 06:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
amendment um the chair recognizes
 
06:31:24.080 --> 06:31:25.830 align:start position:0%
amendment um the chair recognizes
representative

06:31:25.830 --> 06:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:31:32.070 --> 06:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
um we heard test testimony on this bill
 
06:31:40.150 --> 06:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
that the US Supreme Court
 
06:31:45.270 --> 06:31:45.280 align:start position:0%
had in several cases uh determined that
 
06:31:49.468 --> 06:31:49.478 align:start position:0%
a residency requirement was not
 
06:31:52.948 --> 06:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional yet in your Amendment uh
 
06:31:54.590 --> 06:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
line seven
 
06:32:00.230 --> 06:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
and8 it says an an eligibility
 
06:32:03.548 --> 06:32:03.558 align:start position:0%
requirement may require an individual to
 
06:32:06.830 --> 06:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
provide provide proof of residency etc
 
06:32:12.110 --> 06:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
etc does that not open up a town that
 
06:32:17.430 --> 06:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
may require proof to being uh in
 
06:32:19.230 --> 06:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
contradiction of the
 
06:32:22.830 --> 06:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution and uh decisions of the US
 
06:32:22.840 --> 06:32:24.750 align:start position:0%

Court thank you for the
 
06:32:31.468 --> 06:32:31.478 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
06:32:34.548 --> 06:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
um the testimony I heard
 
06:32:38.030 --> 06:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
brought up the fair protection under the
 
06:32:42.350 --> 06:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
law or equal protection
 
06:32:42.360 --> 06:32:43.910 align:start position:0%
law or equal protection
and

06:32:43.910 --> 06:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:32:46.270 --> 06:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
this residency
 
06:32:46.280 --> 06:32:48.270 align:start position:0%
this residency
requirement

06:32:48.270 --> 06:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
06:32:48.280 --> 06:32:50.150 align:start position:0%
requirement
is

06:32:50.150 --> 06:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:32:52.788 --> 06:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
basically something that
 
06:32:55.830 --> 06:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
protects the residents of the
 
06:32:58.070 --> 06:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
town so
 
06:33:01.590 --> 06:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
that everybody is being protected by
 
06:33:04.030 --> 06:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
06:33:04.040 --> 06:33:05.070 align:start position:0%
this amendment
B

06:33:05.070 --> 06:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
B
 
06:33:09.230 --> 06:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
protects the taxpayers of the town to
 
06:33:09.240 --> 06:33:11.350 align:start position:0%
protects the taxpayers of the town to
protect

06:33:11.350 --> 06:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
protect
 
06:33:13.990 --> 06:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
residents and have the funds to be able
 
06:33:17.708 --> 06:33:17.718 align:start position:0%
to do so Roman numeral or letter one
 
06:33:20.750 --> 06:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
number one underneath that
 
06:33:23.868 --> 06:33:23.878 align:start position:0%
protects people that are leaving or
 
06:33:25.990 --> 06:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
fleeing domestic violence stalking
 
06:33:28.190 --> 06:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and human
 
06:33:30.548 --> 06:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
trafficking number
 
06:33:34.468 --> 06:33:34.478 align:start position:0%
two the governing body May at its
 
06:33:36.868 --> 06:33:36.878 align:start position:0%
discretion authorize local assistance
 
06:33:38.788 --> 06:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
administrator to provide emergency
 
06:33:41.230 --> 06:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
assistance to
 
06:33:43.708 --> 06:33:43.718 align:start position:0%
non-resident to a non-resident for up to
 
06:33:47.788 --> 06:33:47.798 align:start position:0%
72 hours again protecting that
 
06:33:51.868 --> 06:33:51.878 align:start position:0%
person and then F protects the
 
06:33:55.548 --> 06:33:55.558 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so that they could have funds
 
06:33:58.150 --> 06:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
available to pay for
 
06:34:01.628 --> 06:34:01.638 align:start position:0%
this because at the end of the day if
 
06:34:04.310 --> 06:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
the funds run out no nobody's getting
 
06:34:08.190 --> 06:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:08.200 --> 06:34:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
law

06:34:09.990 --> 06:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
06:34:13.910 --> 06:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I would like to offer an
 
06:34:17.708 --> 06:34:17.718 align:start position:0%
explanation as well before you give your
 
06:34:22.830 --> 06:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
followup okay so um yes clearly there
 
06:34:27.150 --> 06:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
was evidence that the residency
 
06:34:30.670 --> 06:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
requirement of a specific number of days
 
06:34:34.750 --> 06:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
be it 30 60 90 days in order to receive
 
06:34:34.760 --> 06:34:36.230 align:start position:0%
be it 30 60 90 days in order to receive
welfare

06:34:36.230 --> 06:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
welfare
 
06:34:40.750 --> 06:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
benefits um was deemed to be
 
06:34:42.910 --> 06:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by the United States
 
06:34:45.310 --> 06:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and the were as you stated
 
06:34:47.430 --> 06:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of cases that were
 
06:34:50.670 --> 06:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
brought as evidence of that to this
 
06:34:54.190 --> 06:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
hearing so that was the concern that the
 
06:34:57.948 --> 06:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
bill as written because within
 
06:35:02.510 --> 06:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
May comes the requirement which almost
 
06:35:05.548 --> 06:35:05.558 align:start position:0%
converts to some municipalities could
 
06:35:10.468 --> 06:35:10.478 align:start position:0%
make that a shall that you shall um have
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
residency within this jurisdiction so
 
06:35:15.150 --> 06:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
that clearly is an
 
06:35:15.160 --> 06:35:16.948 align:start position:0%
that clearly is an
issue

06:35:16.948 --> 06:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
issue
 
06:35:21.430 --> 06:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
however the the so in order to um
 
06:35:22.990 --> 06:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
address that
 
06:35:25.350 --> 06:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
concern that is why we have this
 
06:35:28.708 --> 06:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us and if you look
 
06:35:31.388 --> 06:35:31.398 align:start position:0%
that the the wording of the amendment
 
06:35:34.110 --> 06:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
now is may require
 
06:35:37.510 --> 06:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
proof of residency that is different
 
06:35:37.520 --> 06:35:38.510 align:start position:0%
proof of residency that is different
than

06:35:38.510 --> 06:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
06:35:38.520 --> 06:35:40.110 align:start position:0%
than
requiring

06:35:40.110 --> 06:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
06:35:44.190 --> 06:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
residency apparently asking for proof of
 
06:35:49.468 --> 06:35:49.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:52.830 --> 06:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Madam chair I fail to
 
06:35:56.030 --> 06:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
understand the logic behind requiring
 
06:35:58.948 --> 06:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
residency and providing proof of
 
06:36:01.590 --> 06:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
residency they they appear to be one and
 
06:36:04.910 --> 06:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
the same to my mind I I I would agree
 
06:36:08.230 --> 06:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
because when I first
 
06:36:11.788 --> 06:36:11.798 align:start position:0%
um when that was first offered as a
 
06:36:15.830 --> 06:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
distinction I I myself had to um spend
 
06:36:18.990 --> 06:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
some time to think deeply about it but
 
06:36:23.628 --> 06:36:23.638 align:start position:0%
after I I did um look at it carefully
 
06:36:26.110 --> 06:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
yeah there there there is in fact a a
 
06:36:28.070 --> 06:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
difference and
 
06:36:33.628 --> 06:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
that requiring proof of residency is
 
06:36:36.830 --> 06:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
is constitutional it's it's it's it's
 
06:36:40.150 --> 06:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
acceptable to to ask for proof of
 
06:36:43.230 --> 06:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
residency and it says may
 
06:36:49.030 --> 06:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
require um I would even go so far um as
 
06:36:51.030 --> 06:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
to say
 
06:36:53.670 --> 06:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
that there was an individual that
 
06:36:55.990 --> 06:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
provided testimony here before this
 
06:36:59.388 --> 06:36:59.398 align:start position:0%
committee uh and I'm pretty I I I
 
06:37:02.350 --> 06:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
believe he did explain that to to some
 
06:37:02.360 --> 06:37:03.910 align:start position:0%
believe he did explain that to to some
degree

06:37:03.910 --> 06:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
degree
 
06:37:03.920 --> 06:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
degree
yeah

06:37:05.750 --> 06:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:37:09.070 --> 06:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
so you may ask a follow-up question of
 
06:37:09.080 --> 06:37:10.590 align:start position:0%
so you may ask a follow-up question of
the

06:37:10.590 --> 06:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:37:14.070 --> 06:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee um at this point I see no need
 
06:37:18.110 --> 06:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
to ask a follow-up question uh clearly
 
06:37:21.830 --> 06:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
we are interpreting the language very
 
06:37:25.830 --> 06:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
differently so we agree to
 
06:37:29.270 --> 06:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
disagree further comments representative
 
06:37:33.750 --> 06:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair I think um
 
06:37:37.190 --> 06:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
our M our different interpretations are
 
06:37:39.670 --> 06:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what is going to cause a problem
 
06:37:39.680 --> 06:37:40.830 align:start position:0%
exactly what is going to cause a problem
for

06:37:40.830 --> 06:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:37:43.830 --> 06:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities um the question is
 
06:37:45.948 --> 06:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
getting passed and if this were to be
 
06:37:48.590 --> 06:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
passed the question of constitutionality
 
06:37:51.270 --> 06:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
is being passed to the municipality to
 
06:37:54.070 --> 06:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
kind of hash this out and have the same
 
06:37:56.430 --> 06:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
discussion we're having uh the amendment
 
06:37:59.590 --> 06:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
also would create a a huge variation in
 
06:38:01.350 --> 06:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
requirements from town to
 
06:38:03.990 --> 06:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
town uh which could result in push
 
06:38:06.590 --> 06:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
non-residents outside of their
 
06:38:09.070 --> 06:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
communities uh to those that may offer a
 
06:38:11.310 --> 06:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
more humanitarian
 
06:38:14.708 --> 06:38:14.718 align:start position:0%
policy um this is likely to result in
 
06:38:16.990 --> 06:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
overburdening your surrounding
 
06:38:18.948 --> 06:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh with the financial
 
06:38:21.548 --> 06:38:21.558 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of another and that's
 
06:38:24.868 --> 06:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:28.590 --> 06:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
thought further comments represent of
 
06:38:31.190 --> 06:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
Davis and my further comment is that we
 
06:38:34.910 --> 06:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
fix this problem in the last ter term um
 
06:38:39.430 --> 06:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
when we addressed uh H uh RSA 165 and we
 
06:38:42.830 --> 06:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
made it possible for cities like Lebanon
 
06:38:46.190 --> 06:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that have New Hampshire's
 
06:38:50.070 --> 06:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
largest teaching medical facility uh and
 
06:38:54.590 --> 06:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
many many um resources for people who
 
06:38:56.628 --> 06:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
are homeless for people who are poor and
 
06:39:00.150 --> 06:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
needing assistance receiving poor and
 
06:39:02.750 --> 06:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
needy folks from other towns providing
 
06:39:05.150 --> 06:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
that assistance we now have the ability
 
06:39:08.150 --> 06:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
to go back to those towns and seek
 
06:39:11.030 --> 06:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
recompense for the expenses that we have
 
06:39:14.430 --> 06:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
laid out for those needy people uh
 
06:39:19.110 --> 06:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:22.590 --> 06:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
some distinction without a difference
 
06:39:27.070 --> 06:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
question of proof of residence versus
 
06:39:27.080 --> 06:39:28.590 align:start position:0%
question of proof of residence versus
actual

06:39:28.590 --> 06:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
actual
 
06:39:31.388 --> 06:39:31.398 align:start position:0%
residents uh and so the fact that we
 
06:39:34.468 --> 06:39:34.478 align:start position:0%
fixed this in the last term I I fail to
 
06:39:37.548 --> 06:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
see why it needs to be fixed again
 
06:39:40.430 --> 06:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
because From lebanon's perspective which
 
06:39:43.190 --> 06:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
probably expends more on these kinds of
 
06:39:45.590 --> 06:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
resources than most communities in New
 
06:39:50.948 --> 06:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:56.750 --> 06:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:59.070 --> 06:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
06:40:03.350 --> 06:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you madam chair uh I'm want
 
06:40:05.628 --> 06:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
wondering if someone can explain to me a
 
06:40:08.110 --> 06:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
situation that's happened in my town
 
06:40:12.868 --> 06:40:12.878 align:start position:0%
where um underage person was uh came out
 
06:40:14.948 --> 06:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
to their parents and their parents
 
06:40:17.350 --> 06:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
kicked them out of the house no place to
 
06:40:18.750 --> 06:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
live just said
 
06:40:21.868 --> 06:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
bye where in this bill would that person
 
06:40:26.310 --> 06:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
be taken care of um given that they were
 
06:40:27.750 --> 06:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
kicked out of
 
06:40:31.310 --> 06:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh SAU 16 school so they did not
 
06:40:33.590 --> 06:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
reside in the town where the school was
 
06:40:35.548 --> 06:40:35.558 align:start position:0%
they did not reside in they just had in
 
06:40:38.628 --> 06:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
a residence basically um so where would
 
06:40:43.990 --> 06:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:46.468 --> 06:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
06:40:53.948 --> 06:40:53.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:57.948 --> 06:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
question I believe right off the top
 
06:40:57.958 --> 06:40:59.868 align:start position:0%
question I believe right off the top
that

06:40:59.868 --> 06:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:41:03.830 --> 06:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh number one at line 12 special
 
06:41:06.030 --> 06:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
consideration may be provided to
 
06:41:06.040 --> 06:41:07.868 align:start position:0%
consideration may be provided to
non-residents

06:41:07.868 --> 06:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
non-residents
 
06:41:10.788 --> 06:41:10.798 align:start position:0%
If the child was not a resident of that
 
06:41:15.430 --> 06:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:19.150 --> 06:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
SAU um they would be covered under
 
06:41:22.150 --> 06:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
this and
 
06:41:24.948 --> 06:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
also the catchall is number two below
 
06:41:26.868 --> 06:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
that on line 15
 
06:41:29.990 --> 06:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
which uh provides emergency assistance
 
06:41:32.388 --> 06:41:32.398 align:start position:0%
to a non-resident for up to 72 hours to
 
06:41:34.590 --> 06:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
allow application and communication
 
06:41:40.150 --> 06:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:44.190 --> 06:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
Colby and I interpreted um thank you
 
06:41:52.430 --> 06:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair I interpreted those uh those
 
06:41:56.230 --> 06:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
two segments that uh that's great uh if
 
06:41:59.468 --> 06:41:59.478 align:start position:0%
the municipality adopts those two we
 
06:42:04.590 --> 06:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know if um if
 
06:42:06.350 --> 06:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
exiter had
 
06:42:06.360 --> 06:42:08.070 align:start position:0%
exiter had
adopted

06:42:08.070 --> 06:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
06:42:11.110 --> 06:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
um those
 
06:42:13.230 --> 06:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
May uh
 
06:42:16.230 --> 06:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
situations uh so I think the question is
 
06:42:18.388 --> 06:42:18.398 align:start position:0%
still valid where where would that child
 
06:42:25.030 --> 06:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:29.788 --> 06:42:29.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:34.070 --> 06:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
comments representative grundt
 
06:42:36.270 --> 06:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so as much as
 
06:42:38.708 --> 06:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
we're struggling here trying to define
 
06:42:40.750 --> 06:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
residency and all the figuring out all
 
06:42:42.310 --> 06:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
the situations that could possibly
 
06:42:45.868 --> 06:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
happen we push this down to
 
06:42:47.788 --> 06:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities and you're going to get
 
06:42:52.110 --> 06:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
even more questions and more answers and
 
06:42:55.510 --> 06:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
more suggestions and it's just going to
 
06:42:57.468 --> 06:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
I think make it even muddier so I think
 
06:43:00.868 --> 06:43:00.878 align:start position:0%
we need to make the decision here um if
 
06:43:05.750 --> 06:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:05.760 --> 06:43:08.350 align:start position:0%
 
representative

06:43:08.350 --> 06:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:11.430 --> 06:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
Murphy the uh I would think that a child
 
06:43:13.590 --> 06:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
being thrown out of their home by their
 
06:43:16.310 --> 06:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
parents being a minor child is domestic
 
06:43:19.910 --> 06:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
violence plain and simple that's my
 
06:43:21.510 --> 06:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
06:43:25.670 --> 06:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:37.830 --> 06:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:39.948 --> 06:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
turn my mic on there we go uh I'm
 
06:43:43.468 --> 06:43:43.478 align:start position:0%
unclear about the um the very last uh
 
06:43:45.788 --> 06:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
sentence the f a monthly local
 
06:43:48.270 --> 06:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
assistance limit of not less than 50% of
 
06:43:50.230 --> 06:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
the federal poverty

happens um they don't have to prove
 
06:45:54.628 --> 06:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
anything and I wouldn't think they'd
 
06:45:55.548 --> 06:45:55.558 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:45:55.558 --> 06:45:57.070 align:start position:0%

06:45:58.948 --> 06:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:46:01.830 --> 06:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
anything in the future they would just
 
06:46:04.270 --> 06:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
be given special
 
06:46:06.830 --> 06:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
consideration if they're non-residents
 
06:46:09.110 --> 06:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's left their town of origin due to
 
06:46:09.120 --> 06:46:10.350 align:start position:0%
that's left their town of origin due to
those

06:46:10.350 --> 06:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:46:13.628 --> 06:46:13.638 align:start position:0%
reasons right now they don't need to
 
06:46:15.590 --> 06:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
claim any of those reasons they can just
 
06:46:17.990 --> 06:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
show up and ask for
 
06:46:22.070 --> 06:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:26.468 --> 06:46:26.478 align:start position:0%
non-resident follow please yes I is
 
06:46:29.388 --> 06:46:29.398 align:start position:0%
there any indication of of
 
06:46:33.150 --> 06:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
fraudulent claims of this type to get
 
06:46:37.708 --> 06:46:37.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:40.310 --> 06:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
happen anecdotally I'm a selectman in
 
06:46:43.948 --> 06:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
town and I can tell you yes but I cannot
 
06:46:47.110 --> 06:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
discuss it because of the privacy rules
 
06:46:50.150 --> 06:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you this we are paying
 
06:46:53.750 --> 06:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
the town of Swansea right now $22,900 a
 
06:46:56.868 --> 06:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
month to house somebody in nsha in a
 
06:47:00.990 --> 06:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
hotel room now you might ask yourself
 
06:47:01.000 --> 06:47:01.830 align:start position:0%
hotel room now you might ask yourself
why

06:47:01.830 --> 06:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:47:04.990 --> 06:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
Nashua well I'll tell you they showed up
 
06:47:05.000 --> 06:47:05.868 align:start position:0%
Nashua well I'll tell you they showed up
in

06:47:05.868 --> 06:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:47:10.430 --> 06:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
town and they ended up going to local
 
06:47:13.628 --> 06:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
hotels that we paid for they destroyed
 
06:47:16.270 --> 06:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
the hotels they were kicked out of the
 
06:47:19.670 --> 06:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
hotels there are 14 hotels around
 
06:47:22.310 --> 06:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
Swansea that they are no longer allowed
 
06:47:25.510 --> 06:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
in so they go to
 
06:47:28.948 --> 06:47:28.958 align:start position:0%
nashaa and it's $2,900 a month that the
 
06:47:32.110 --> 06:47:32.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of my town are paying to house
 
06:47:34.230 --> 06:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
somebody that doesn't respect the
 
06:47:34.240 --> 06:47:37.070 align:start position:0%
somebody that doesn't respect the
property

06:47:37.070 --> 06:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
property
 
06:47:41.628 --> 06:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
or really the law so we need to do
 
06:47:45.190 --> 06:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
something thank you so before I um allow
 
06:47:47.830 --> 06:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
any other um discussion I I just would
 
06:47:50.868 --> 06:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
want to Simply point out that lines 12
 
06:47:53.468 --> 06:47:53.478 align:start position:0%
through 14 were added to this amendment
 
06:47:55.430 --> 06:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
because during the hearing there was
 
06:47:58.030 --> 06:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
feedback where people expressed the bill
 
06:48:00.510 --> 06:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
as written they were very concerned that
 
06:48:02.788 --> 06:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence stalking
 
06:48:05.030 --> 06:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
sexual assault or human trafficking
 
06:48:07.670 --> 06:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
would be negatively affected by the bill
 
06:48:11.990 --> 06:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
as written so this um inclusion in the
 
06:48:15.030 --> 06:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um is a safety net and a
 
06:48:18.190 --> 06:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
provision to to to um protect those
 
06:48:20.948 --> 06:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
people so that they can get in when
 
06:48:23.230 --> 06:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
they're in those situations and they're
 
06:48:25.350 --> 06:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
saying that they're victims of of of
 
06:48:29.388 --> 06:48:29.398 align:start position:0%
these sorts of things they they can get
 
06:48:33.190 --> 06:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
the help that they need and and not um
 
06:48:35.948 --> 06:48:35.958 align:start position:0%
and not be um
 
06:48:41.388 --> 06:48:41.398 align:start position:0%
rejected um so representative
 
06:48:43.990 --> 06:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
grund uh thank you
 
06:48:47.468 --> 06:48:47.478 align:start position:0%
um I think we're still required out even
 
06:48:52.270 --> 06:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
if we have a budget for welfare and more
 
06:48:53.948 --> 06:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
people come in and exceeds I think we're
 
06:48:56.110 --> 06:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
still required to pay out I don't think
 
06:48:58.750 --> 06:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
you can just stop paying out so this
 
06:49:00.468 --> 06:49:00.478 align:start position:0%
isn't going to stop payouts it's not
 
06:49:02.110 --> 06:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
going to stop a budget it's not going to
 
06:49:04.670 --> 06:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
stop much of anything and I feel like
 
06:49:06.190 --> 06:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
this is really
 
06:49:06.200 --> 06:49:07.830 align:start position:0%
this is really
redefining

06:49:07.830 --> 06:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
redefining
 
06:49:10.990 --> 06:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
welfare rules like who qualifies and
 
06:49:13.548 --> 06:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
this is Way Beyond what the original
 
06:49:16.990 --> 06:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:20.070 --> 06:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
about representative
 
06:49:22.468 --> 06:49:22.478 align:start position:0%
stavis if I can remember my train of
 
06:49:25.628 --> 06:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
thought uh my first question has to do
 
06:49:28.430 --> 06:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
with uh line
 
06:49:31.990 --> 06:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
16 uh what happens after the 72 hours
 
06:49:33.190 --> 06:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
have elapsed
 
06:49:35.510 --> 06:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
what if somebody shows up at the Town
 
06:49:38.868 --> 06:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
Hall as you have noted
 
06:49:42.110 --> 06:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and the Town Administrator says well
 
06:49:43.910 --> 06:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
we have to communicate with your town of
 
06:49:47.270 --> 06:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
origin to prove who you are and where
 
06:49:50.388 --> 06:49:50.398 align:start position:0%
you're from but it's Thanksgiving Day
 
06:49:52.788 --> 06:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
weekend and it's going to be more than
 
06:49:55.548 --> 06:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
72 hours before anyone can be reached
 
06:49:58.468 --> 06:49:58.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:03.788 --> 06:50:03.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:06.750 --> 06:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
representative kazinski thank you madam
 
06:50:09.750 --> 06:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
chairperson um thank you for the
 
06:50:12.750 --> 06:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
question 72 hours ought to be enough
 
06:50:17.510 --> 06:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
time to do something four day
 
06:50:20.788 --> 06:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
weekend you know I think we can get a
 
06:50:23.310 --> 06:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
hold of somebody or get them in a
 
06:50:26.948 --> 06:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
shelter within that 72 hours the idea
 
06:50:29.350 --> 06:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
behind this is
 
06:50:32.910 --> 06:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
that there's no answer if they can't
 
06:50:35.110 --> 06:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
prove the residency in that
 
06:50:37.230 --> 06:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
town and they don't have any of the
 
06:50:39.310 --> 06:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
other special
 
06:50:41.350 --> 06:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
considerations their town of origin
 
06:50:44.070 --> 06:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
should be taken care of them and if that
 
06:50:45.990 --> 06:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
means that we drive them back to that
 
06:50:48.830 --> 06:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
town obviously in they're in our town on
 
06:50:48.840 --> 06:50:50.150 align:start position:0%
town obviously in they're in our town on
Thanksgiving

06:50:50.150 --> 06:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving
 
06:50:52.670 --> 06:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
day and we're supposed to provide care
 
06:50:54.830 --> 06:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
for 72 hours the town of origin should
 
06:50:57.708 --> 06:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
be able to do the
 
06:51:00.750 --> 06:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
same yes representative stavis thank you
 
06:51:03.230 --> 06:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
for um your answer repres
 
06:51:07.270 --> 06:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
resentative um it is clear to me that we
 
06:51:12.788 --> 06:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
are on opposing sides of this issue um
 
06:51:14.548 --> 06:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
and that's fine that's what we're here
 
06:51:18.110 --> 06:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
to do I would simply like to say that HB
 
06:51:23.708 --> 06:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
165 is RSA 165 I'm sorry is uh a statute
 
06:51:25.868 --> 06:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire should be rightly
 
06:51:30.628 --> 06:51:30.638 align:start position:0%
proud of that it demands that we take
 
06:51:33.868 --> 06:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
care of our needy in this State and it
 
06:51:38.030 --> 06:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
was passed at a time when you got places
 
06:51:42.110 --> 06:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
by walking or if you had a horse and it
 
06:51:45.750 --> 06:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
has been in place since then now there
 
06:51:47.910 --> 06:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
are cars now there are other modes of
 
06:51:50.070 --> 06:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
transportation and we have updated the
 
06:51:52.830 --> 06:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
law to accommodate those changing
 
06:51:55.430 --> 06:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances yet we have still remained
 
06:51:58.868 --> 06:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
true to the principle that we need to
 
06:52:02.190 --> 06:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
help those Among Us who are the neediest
 
06:52:06.590 --> 06:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
and I I for one am proud of oursa 165
 
06:52:10.868 --> 06:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:13.190 --> 06:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
changed representative
 
06:52:17.110 --> 06:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
Gerard thank you madam chair um I do
 
06:52:18.868 --> 06:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
greatly appreciate what you're trying to
 
06:52:20.590 --> 06:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
do because we've run into the same
 
06:52:23.230 --> 06:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
concerns I'm looking at this though and
 
06:52:26.350 --> 06:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
you've talked about how after 72 hours
 
06:52:27.468 --> 06:52:27.478 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to reach back to
 
06:52:30.430 --> 06:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
the local community currently the I
 
06:52:31.948 --> 06:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
believe the bill that was put in last
 
06:52:34.628 --> 06:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
year after 30 days if they left your
 
06:52:36.750 --> 06:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
community you were no longer going to be
 
06:52:38.868 --> 06:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
responsible for how long is this going
 
06:52:41.070 --> 06:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
to make you responsible for that person
 
06:52:43.350 --> 06:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
that sitting in nashwa as you keep
 
06:52:45.430 --> 06:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
describing at this point I I honestly
 
06:52:47.628 --> 06:52:47.638 align:start position:0%
think it may be a a bigger concern for
 
06:52:50.070 --> 06:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
your local community as much as I I
 
06:52:52.030 --> 06:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
can't answer how much is coming across
 
06:52:54.830 --> 06:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
the border I watched last year as Keen I
 
06:52:56.830 --> 06:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
know we went over budget and there was
 
06:52:58.708 --> 06:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
many other communities went in but I
 
06:53:00.750 --> 06:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
think honestly you're you're creating an
 
06:53:03.830 --> 06:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
opening to a allow for your community
 
06:53:05.190 --> 06:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
actually to be responsible for this
 
06:53:06.788 --> 06:53:06.798 align:start position:0%
person for eternity because they'll
 
06:53:08.948 --> 06:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
never actually get a a permanent
 
06:53:17.270 --> 06:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:20.190 --> 06:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
hotel i' like just to quickly add that
 
06:53:25.708 --> 06:53:25.718 align:start position:0%
um lines 15 through 17 were added due to
 
06:53:27.830 --> 06:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
um testimony that we
 
06:53:31.510 --> 06:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
heard that there were concerns that a
 
06:53:34.868 --> 06:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
person that had just come into town and
 
06:53:37.430 --> 06:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
they were in an emergency situation and
 
06:53:40.070 --> 06:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
needed temporary assistance you know if
 
06:53:42.150 --> 06:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's the winter that they could freeze
 
06:53:44.270 --> 06:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
and this was
 
06:53:47.948 --> 06:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
um good faith Good Will to to address
 
06:53:50.750 --> 06:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
those concerns it's it wasn't here to
 
06:53:54.910 --> 06:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
restrict anything but to alleviate those
 
06:53:58.310 --> 06:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
concerns further
 
06:54:00.708 --> 06:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
discussion um
 
06:54:03.670 --> 06:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative rocked
 
06:54:07.190 --> 06:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I would again
 
06:54:10.350 --> 06:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
like to point out that in the amendment
 
06:54:12.708 --> 06:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through
 
06:54:16.868 --> 06:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
14 dealing with people who
 
06:54:20.150 --> 06:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
are are or claimed to be victims of
 
06:54:22.628 --> 06:54:22.638 align:start position:0%
domestic violence so
 
06:54:25.788 --> 06:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
stalking sexual assault or human
 
06:54:30.468 --> 06:54:30.478 align:start position:0%
trafficking it's a May it's not a shall
 
06:54:33.948 --> 06:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
so when a town writes their required
 
06:54:37.510 --> 06:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines they could very possibly say
 
06:54:40.788 --> 06:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
that people who are V who
 
06:54:45.868 --> 06:54:45.878 align:start position:0%
are victims of domestic violence etc etc
 
06:54:48.628 --> 06:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
can go to the next
 
06:54:54.270 --> 06:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:56.430 --> 06:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
06:54:59.430 --> 06:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
Colby thank you madam chair um along the
 
06:55:01.788 --> 06:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
same lines it also continues special
 
06:55:03.830 --> 06:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
consideration may be provided to
 
06:55:06.868 --> 06:55:06.878 align:start position:0%
non-residents the governing body May at
 
06:55:08.830 --> 06:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
its discretion authorize the local
 
06:55:11.590 --> 06:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
assistance so again it this is going to
 
06:55:14.030 --> 06:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
cause so many variations and so many
 
06:55:15.990 --> 06:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
situations from municipality to
 
06:55:19.788 --> 06:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
municipality being different thank you
 
06:55:23.830 --> 06:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
so yes I I would like to um add because
 
06:55:27.468 --> 06:55:27.478 align:start position:0%
I have heard that comment about the peac
 
06:55:31.388 --> 06:55:31.398 align:start position:0%
meil or Patchwork application of that um
 
06:55:34.628 --> 06:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:36.868 --> 06:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
we already have that because the
 
06:55:41.350 --> 06:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
guidelines um shall include but not be
 
06:55:44.190 --> 06:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
limited to so these are
 
06:55:47.750 --> 06:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
minimum guidelines but
 
06:55:51.190 --> 06:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities may include other
 
06:55:54.070 --> 06:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
guidelines so inherently in the bill I
 
06:55:56.948 --> 06:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
mean in the statute without this bill we
 
06:56:00.150 --> 06:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
already have that you know differences
 
06:56:04.070 --> 06:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
between municipalities based on my
 
06:56:05.830 --> 06:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of the
 
06:56:09.708 --> 06:56:09.718 align:start position:0%
law so to me this is not making it's
 
06:56:12.510 --> 06:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's more of the same but it just gives
 
06:56:17.230 --> 06:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
it gives options it gives local control
 
06:56:20.190 --> 06:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
with regards to what that particular
 
06:56:22.150 --> 06:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
munici M
 
06:56:25.310 --> 06:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
municipality wants how they want to
 
06:56:29.350 --> 06:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
administer their um their
 
06:56:42.070 --> 06:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:45.468 --> 06:56:45.478 align:start position:0%
yes so um I'm just looking at the clock
 
06:56:47.868 --> 06:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
and I'm not trying to rush anything um
 
06:56:49.990 --> 06:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
but with regards to this amendment here
 
06:56:52.830 --> 06:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
before us I think we've debated it and
 
06:56:55.708 --> 06:56:55.718 align:start position:0%
discussed it sufficiently I feel that we
 
06:56:59.628 --> 06:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
should um move to vote on the acceptance
 
06:57:02.150 --> 06:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
of this amendment or not is
 
06:57:04.468 --> 06:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
representative stavis are you in in
 
06:57:06.388 --> 06:57:06.398 align:start position:0%
agreement with that to move forward
 
06:57:11.270 --> 06:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:14.670 --> 06:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
you so the motion before us right now is
 
06:57:16.430 --> 06:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
06:57:16.440 --> 06:57:21.030 align:start position:0%
to accept

07:03:27.948 --> 07:03:27.958 align:start position:0%
Burke I would like to make the motion on

HB 453 which is prohibiting
 
07:03:32.190 --> 07:03:32.200 align:start position:0%

removal equipment with internal
 
07:03:37.270 --> 07:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
combustion engines I would like to make
 
07:03:39.310 --> 07:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
a motion all to
 
07:03:41.510 --> 07:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
pass there a
 
07:03:44.350 --> 07:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
second representative Elward seconds
 
07:03:49.030 --> 07:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:51.388 --> 07:03:51.398 align:start position:0%
motion upon reading further into the
 
07:03:53.990 --> 07:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill the sponsor felt it necessary to
 
07:03:57.788 --> 07:03:57.798 align:start position:0%
draw up and draft this legislation um to
 
07:04:01.270 --> 07:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
be voted on uh and if you notice you've
 
07:04:05.150 --> 07:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
go to page two it goes into individual
 
07:04:08.548 --> 07:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
citizens actually being able to use uh
 
07:04:08.558 --> 07:04:09.510 align:start position:0%
citizens actually being able to use uh
gas

07:04:09.510 --> 07:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
gas
 
07:04:13.150 --> 07:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
combustible type snow removal and such
 
07:04:15.788 --> 07:04:15.798 align:start position:0%
and as I live off the
 
07:04:18.270 --> 07:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
grid I can tell you that just relying
 
07:04:20.150 --> 07:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
strictly on electricity is very very
 
07:04:22.230 --> 07:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
expensive and because I do represent
 
07:04:23.948 --> 07:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
farmers in a rural
 
07:04:26.430 --> 07:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
District this is why I wish to at least
 
07:04:28.150 --> 07:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
have this Safeguard in place so we we
 
07:04:30.548 --> 07:04:30.558 align:start position:0%
could do one or the other but not be
 
07:04:33.590 --> 07:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
prohibited from one
 
07:04:35.948 --> 07:04:35.958 align:start position:0%

07:04:52.190 --> 07:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's uh unwise of us to uh
 
07:04:55.510 --> 07:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
require uh such Behavior as this would
 
07:04:58.230 --> 07:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
require municipalities especially to
 
07:05:01.230 --> 07:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
recapitalize a very expensive uh
 
07:05:01.240 --> 07:05:02.670 align:start position:0%
recapitalize a very expensive uh
equipment

07:05:02.670 --> 07:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
07:05:05.430 --> 07:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
and drive the cost of local government
 
07:05:07.990 --> 07:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
much higher than it already
 
07:05:12.070 --> 07:05:12.080 align:start position:0%

the precedent if the sponsor doesn't
 
07:05:22.708 --> 07:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
show up we've gone it all on the bill
 
07:05:24.310 --> 07:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
we're not able to ask questions we're
 
07:05:27.468 --> 07:05:27.478 align:start position:0%
not able to get clarity um regardless of
 
07:05:29.310 --> 07:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
what has been submitted we haven't been
 
07:05:31.310 --> 07:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
able to uh to go through the normal
 
07:05:31.320 --> 07:05:32.468 align:start position:0%
able to uh to go through the normal
process

07:05:32.468 --> 07:05:32.478 align:start position:0%
process
 
07:05:34.708 --> 07:05:34.718 align:start position:0%
uh with this bill and in keeping with
 
07:05:37.628 --> 07:05:37.638 align:start position:0%
that precedent that we have of going itl
 
07:05:40.670 --> 07:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh I can't support the O OTP
 
07:05:43.430 --> 07:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
motion further discussion representative
 
07:05:45.990 --> 07:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank you madam chair I agree
 
07:05:49.430 --> 07:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
with the previous uh two speakers and it
 
07:05:52.510 --> 07:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
seems to me that uh Lo any local
 
07:05:55.070 --> 07:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
community that wants to Institute this
 
07:05:58.150 --> 07:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
at a local level don't need the state to
 
07:06:02.350 --> 07:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:02.360 --> 07:06:04.190 align:start position:0%
 
further

07:06:04.190 --> 07:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
further
 
07:06:06.590 --> 07:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
comments so I had two quick comments so
 
07:06:08.670 --> 07:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
the first one would be with regards to
 
07:06:11.628 --> 07:06:11.638 align:start position:0%
the Precedence of this this um committee
 
07:06:13.270 --> 07:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
we we do have a new
 
07:06:17.788 --> 07:06:17.798 align:start position:0%
chair and um new membership and while in
 
07:06:20.788 --> 07:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
general I agree with with that precedent
 
07:06:24.990 --> 07:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
the chair is privy to um information
 
07:06:27.430 --> 07:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
that it was through no fault of the the
 
07:06:30.190 --> 07:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
the individual the prime sponsor so
 
07:06:32.990 --> 07:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
therefore in in l of his presence he he
 
07:06:35.750 --> 07:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
did send written testimony to us and the
 
07:06:39.468 --> 07:06:39.478 align:start position:0%
bill is um in my opinion straightforward
 
07:06:42.070 --> 07:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
and and quite understandable and so my
 
07:06:44.230 --> 07:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
second um comment would be that the bill
 
07:06:48.030 --> 07:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
clearly Pro protects individual property
 
07:06:50.948 --> 07:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
owners and businesses from restrictive
 
07:06:53.708 --> 07:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
and overreaching Municipal regulations
 
07:06:57.548 --> 07:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
so I uh am in support of this
 
07:07:03.070 --> 07:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:06.350 --> 07:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none the motion before us is
 
07:07:08.830 --> 07:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on House Bill
 
07:07:11.548 --> 07:07:11.558 align:start position:0%

McDonald I hope me understand this right

but if
 
07:09:25.190 --> 07:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
we if this becomes a law it's going to
 
07:09:27.868 --> 07:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
let the towns tell us that we can't buy
 
07:09:31.388 --> 07:09:31.398 align:start position:0%
gas powerered lawnmowers weed whackers
 
07:09:33.510 --> 07:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
or anything gas powered to do our lawn
 
07:09:35.590 --> 07:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
do I have a correct interpretation of
 
07:09:38.430 --> 07:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
that that would be correct so that would
 
07:09:40.070 --> 07:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
mean the town would tell me that I would
 
07:09:43.030 --> 07:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
have to buy electric operated tools that
