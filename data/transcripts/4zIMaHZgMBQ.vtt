will start with
 
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
um our first bill HP uh 105 creating a
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
new conservation license plate and
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
directing the additional fee to the
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
crinian bacteria mitigation load and
 
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 align:start position:0%

I'm very pleased to introduce HB 105 FN
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
it is to provide a non-tax revenue
 
00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
source for the cyanobacteria mitigation
 
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 align:start position:0%

Environmental Services as you may be
 
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
aware toxic cyanobacteria blooms are
 
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
increasing in frequency and duration
 
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the world including New
 
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lakes ponds and rivers they
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
threaten the health of people and
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
animals and risk billions of dollars in
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
value created by our Lakes controlling
 
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
is complicated and
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
expensive although we can't directly
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
control the warming of water which
 
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
drives the prevailance of blooms we can
 
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
control the nutrients which feed CYO
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms specifically phosphorus
 
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.309 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms specifically phosphorus
and

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
nitrogen to to do this Dees and lake and
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
Watershed associations rely on water
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
body specific studies to identify the
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
source of nutrients which enter a lake
 
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
or are embedded in the
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
sediment these studies referred to as
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
watershed management plans or Watershed
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
based plans come at a cost raging from
 
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
$50,000 and up among the plans
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
deliverables are theide identification
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
of specific projects to mitigate
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
nutrient loading which may include
 
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
Culvert replacement or maintenance
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
on sometimes if the nutrients are
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%

blooming Dees uses watershed management
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
plans to assist it in determining which
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
projects receive available
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
funding all these projects come at a
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
cost that can range from several
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars to hundreds of
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars Dees Awards funding
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
to support Watershed water quality needs
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
through Section 319 of the EPA matching
 
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
grants and section
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
604b but these these total less than
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
half a million per year and I'm sure the
 
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
folks from DS will correct me if I'm
 
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
that but that's far less than the
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
current need for example the Lake Winn
 
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
pasak Alliance has identified 270
 
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
mitigation projects with 50 completed to
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
complete all of them for this Lake would
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
require more than $9 million and those
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
are just projects that are identified
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
now that haven't been identified through
 
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
watershed management planning that's in
 
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
process or planned in the future when
 
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
the cyano bacteria mitigation loan and
 
00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
Grant fund was established in
 
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
2023 it initially received $1 million
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
from the general fund it received
 
00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
another 500,000 from arpa funds and
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
500,000 from
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
Surplus most has already been spent we
 
00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
need a sustainable source of funding to
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
address this growing need of
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms the love New
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes Conservation plate which
 
00:08:42.589 --> 00:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
is proposed in HP
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
105 also known as The Loon plate will
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
meet a tremendous need in the state by
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
generating sustainable non-tax Revenue
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
to help address the growing problem of
 
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
toxic cyanobacteria blooms it's
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
uncertain how much revenue will be
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
generated annually but the Moose plate
 
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:05.959 align:start position:0%
program has generated over $30 million
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
since its Inception in
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
2001 that is over $1 million per year if
 
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
the Loon plate generates even half this
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
much it will help us respond and
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
mitigate the threat toxic cyanobacteria
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
blooms pose poses to the health of our
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
people animals environment and economy
 
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
it will also help us raise awareness
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
that new New Hampshire Lakes are a
 
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
Priceless resource to our state and
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
deserve protection so I ask you to
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
please support a recommendation of ought
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
to pass on HB 105 and I'm welcome I
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
welcome any of your questions thank you
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rang any
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative V thank you Mr chairman
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
um why is C of bacteria such a health
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
concern what kind of conditions or what
 
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
what does it have on human oh thank you
 
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
representative for the question um
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
exposure to toxic
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria is um has both acute and
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
chronic impacts on human health um acute
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
that mean would be exposure immediately
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
to a bloom would result in or may result
 
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
in skin rashes any ingestion would
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
result in gastrointestinal
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
distress um and headaches flu like
 
00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
symptoms um chronically exposure to
 
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
certain toxins that are in
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and and I should say that
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
not all cyanobacteria are toxic but when
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
we identify a bloom um we assume that
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
there's toxicity in in the bloom and um
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
because there is severe tar there's um
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
anox sins which affect the liver and
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's neurotoxins which affect the the
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
neurological system there's very strong
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
evidence that's linking
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
exposure to a component of toxin called
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
bmaa to ALS and other neurological
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
diseases in fact there's a uh one of the
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
leading researchers in this field is Dr
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
Elijah STL out of Dartmouth um and his
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
research was has also been um supported
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
by research done at the University of
 
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
Miami so but it may take years there's
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
other elements um to contributing to
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
that ALS that besides could be
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
bmaa um but it is I mean I know people
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
personally who have had acute symptoms
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
of sinal bacteria blooms and they didn't
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
even know it was from Sino bacteria they
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
were just swimming from one side of a
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
lake to another and they didn't realize
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
they were swimming through a bloom and
 
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
then they got sick and the bloom was
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
identified and then they put two and two
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
together and there's also been pets who
 
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
have died and also pets who become very
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
very critically ill um from exposure
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
exposure to blooms and it's particularly
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
hazardous to the pets and children
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
because they have a a lower body mass
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
and so exposure to those
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
toxins have come at a much higher impact
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
larger but thank you for the question
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:21.629 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
representative

00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
um difficult question to answer I'm I'm
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
certain but I wanted to see if you have
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
any any better information um you
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Moose plates that we
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
currently offer um my my suggestion
 
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
might be that some of the same people
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
buying the Moose plates would be buying
 
00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
these so I'm not sure it's you would get
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
the accurate number of just by looking
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
at moose plates and and these and
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
thinking it would do the same but but at
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
$30 a piece which is what I'm gathering
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
here um
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me you'd have to sell
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
an enormous number of these to to to
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
make a dent in what is needed for um
 
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
Lake mitigation or or even um I I know
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
what the septic systems cost uh around
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
the lake and uh they're enormous so I'm
 
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how this is going
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
to solve any kind of a large problem
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we have here thank you for the
 
00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
question representative the $30 is based
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
on what the Moose plate is being charged
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
and um and I do expect that there may be
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
some people that switch from the Moose
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
plate to the loom plate I'll be one of
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
them but then there's other people like
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
my husband who doesn't have a special
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
plate and I know that he'll want to get
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
the Loon plate because he wants we've
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
been doing whatever we can personally to
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
support uh cyob bacteria mitigation um
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
Andrea larno who is the executive
 
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire Lakes I
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
believe they did a survey um of their
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
membership of who has moose plates that
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
would switch who doesn't have plates but
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
would get the Loon plat so she could
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
probably answer that part of your
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
question um and as far as the revenue of
 
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
this covering the costs of mitigation
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
projects it's not going to um but we do
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
receive uh 319 grants from the federal
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
government um other monies that can come
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
in um I look at the money coming in here
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to speak for de yes
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
I know they're here but um it likely
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
would go to ensure that we do those
 
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
watershed management plans so we
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
identify where those sources of
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
nutrients going into a lake and that's
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
very important information because many
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
Lake Associations will fund their own
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
projects they'll do them but sometimes
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
just getting that upfront cost to do
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
that watershed management planning
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
because that takes about 18 months to
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
actually and that's a good timeline to
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
get one of those completed because
 
00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of water testing that has
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
to go on there's a lot of inspection of
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
Shoreline to really understand non-point
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
Sol non-important sources of some of
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
these uh contaminants so it will help
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
and I don't want um I don't I forget is
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
it good to be the enemy of perfect I
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
think we need we need money to address
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
this problem and just because it's not
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
the money that will fund all of the
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
project s we have to do something it's
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
it I don't know if you're aware of last
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
summer but it was brutal up in the Lakes
 
00:15:36.509 --> 00:15:36.519 align:start position:0%
Region with all the blooms they were
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
hitting lakes that never saw blooms
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
before follow up thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
um I wonder if there is any and maybe
 
00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's someone behind you that would have
 
00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
the information about um how many
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
households would be affected um within a
 
00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:01.399 align:start position:0%
with within New Hampshire just by um
 
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
effects in in various Lakes you know it
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
it would seem that um the density is
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
much greater around the lakes and and
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how far away from that
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
concentric Circle theory of the of the
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
Lakes how many families would be
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
affected by um mitigation or something
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
like that is that part of those studies
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um Dr Stalin Dartmouth um
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
has a
 
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
study and um he presented it to the sb85
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
commission uh a year ago almost a year
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
ago now um it was to health care
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
providers in New Hampshire it was a
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
presentation he gave to healthc care
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
providers but he shared it with the S
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
sp85 commission which looks at
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
environmentally triggered
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
diseases and I believe in that and it's
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
on YouTube if you want to look at it but
 
00:16:59.470 --> 00:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
um I believe in that in among his slides
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
he showed that from three up to 3 to 5
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
kilometers away from a bloom um people
 
00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
can inhale bmaa this was particularly
 
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
just looking at bmaa which is just a
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
component of certain cyanobacteria
 
00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:16.069 align:start position:0%
component of certain cyanobacteria
blooms

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
blooms
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
so and he's also identified clusters of
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
ALS that have been associated with
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
chronic cyanobacteria blooms one um is
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
MOMA Lake and there's was one that was
 
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
identified I think a year or two ago
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
around the eastern shore of Lake
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
Champagne which has also been severely
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
impacted by blooms so it doesn't have to
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
be just people right next to the water
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
getting um skin contact with the toxins
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
the toxins can become um aized and
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
people can you know ingest them you know
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
can breathe them in and that can happen
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
3 to 5 kilometers away I don't know if
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
but there are there are um there's
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
studies going on all over the world
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
about this so the research is still is
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
still coming out but it is um not as
 
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
questionable as to what the impacts are
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
as they were five 10 years
 
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
ago and and I think that you know their
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
DS can probably answer that more but
 
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
those are the people that would pay more
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
for a license plate because they are
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
more direct IR ly impacted somebody who
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
is not doesn't go to the Lakes doesn't
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
contribute to the lake economy they're
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be forced to put into this
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
fund if unless they want to unless they
 
00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
want to get that plate and pay the extra
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
$30 but $30 adds up when you look at um
 
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.350 align:start position:0%
$30 but $30 adds up when you look at um
I

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
think I had some data but there are
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of plates those
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
moose plates that are issued every year
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
I think it's it might be close to 2,000
 
00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's over a th000 though for
 
00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.669 align:start position:0%
I think it's over a th000 though for
sure

00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
Crawford thank you um representative R
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
do you have any written testimony that
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
you want to yes I will share it with you
 
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.350 align:start position:0%
you want to yes I will share it with you
thank

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
much chair would now like to recognize
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative paternal who is in
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
support of the bill asking for one 1 to
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
two minutes welcome representative to
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation good morning thank you Mr
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
chair and the um committee for hearing
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
my testimony I just wanted to um I'm for
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Katie Pell I represent
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
the towns of wolfboro and tufton in the
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
beautiful Lakes Region and I just want
 
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
to express my support for this bill
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
especially it being a non-
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funded voluntary option to
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
raise awareness about the issue of cyano
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
bacteria and how it impacts our Lakes um
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
the two towns that I represent would be
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
are significantly impacted by these
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms they impact our
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
tourism and even our the health of our
 
00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
local population taking advantage of the
 
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
Lakes so I just want to again just want
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
to express my support I don't have any
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
technical background or information to
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
add so you can ask me all the questions
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
you want and I probably won't be able to
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
answer them but thank you very much
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
thank representative any questions from
 
00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:24.909 align:start position:0%
thank representative any questions from
the

00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:24.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
Cher I would like to recognize
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
representative uh MC mcdom
 
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
McDonald uh who is in support of the
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill who is asking for two minutes
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
you today I'm probably going to repeat a
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
lot of stuff that uh the previous
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative just said uh but I'm uh
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
repr K district 6 which is the community
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
of of w and tuoro and we'd like to ask
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
you to support this particular bill it's
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
an important bill as it deals with the
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
health of several hundred bodies of our
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
Waters in New Hampshire currently many l
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
many lakes and ponds are experiencing C
 
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms these blooms affect not
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
only the health of the person in the
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
water or using the water but also the
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
economy in general I'm sure during the
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
summertime you may watch channel n and
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
they'll have cob bacterial warnings or
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see something on Facebook that
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
all has a negative effect on U uh
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
boating uh hotel rentals and generally
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
people come up coming up here to enjoy
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
our Waters uh would ask that you support
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
the 30 uh $30 fee which will establish
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
the cob bacteria mitigation loan and
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
Grant fund to address this growing
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
problem thank you thank you
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative any questions from the
 
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
committee not seey thank you so much
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
chery and i' like to recognize
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
Amy smuga did I get it right that was
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty good for was smula yep
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
smula from the New Hampshire Dees who is
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
asking for two minutes who has some
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
written testimony I believe you emails
 
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
yes correct yes it came over this
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
morning so my name is Amy smula I am
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Environmental
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
Services and I'm the director of the
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
limnology center there where we study
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
the water quality of lakes ponds and
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
rivers representative rung gave you a
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
really good background of the uh program
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
for Sino bacteria and the impacts and
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to build on that a little
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
bit from the the agency's
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
standpoint the Department of
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services is just tracking
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
this bill at this point we're remaining
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill but I do want to
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
provide some uh information about the
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
blooms that we are seeing cyanobacteria
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
were for formerly called Blu green algae
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
that may have been another term that
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
were familiar with uh cyanobacteria is
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
the the current term that we are using
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
and they're often responsible for
 
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
producing harmful Alo blooms in surface
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
waters due to warm temperatures and high
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
nutrient concentrations they can also be
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
there when the nutrients are not high as
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
well in the past two years NH uh nhdes
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
has seen unprecedented numbers of
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms across our state
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
we've issued more than 120 cyanobacteria
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
warnings due to high cell counts we use
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
70,000 Mill 70,000 cells per milliliter
 
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
as a threshold and that's a fairly High
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
cell count that's usually when you see
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
the scummy growth along the shoreline
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
and it turns the water a bluish green
 
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
color uh and when it's that high they
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
can produce toxins which representative
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
rung nicely
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed so those cyanotoxins have been
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
documented to cause harm to Aquatic Life
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
and to human health so those are the
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're concerned it's more
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
than just the unsafe appearance of the
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
blooms in 2022 Governor cunu signed
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1066 into law which directed
 
00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
to develop a plan to prevent the
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
increase of and eventually control C of
 
00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms in the state water
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
bodies so after Governor cuno signed
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
that bill there was a commission that
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
worked for over a year to evaluate
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
different program elements that Dees
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
would Implement in the future to
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
mitigate the impacts of cyanobacteria
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
that effort is largely unfunded except
 
00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
for a onetime $1 million appropriation
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
from the legislature that started off
 
00:24:41.149 --> 00:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
the cyanobacteria mitigation fund and we
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
also did receive
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
$500,000 of as a onetime appropriation
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
from the American Rescue plan act
 
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
funding so we were working off about a
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
$1.5 million budget of that we only have
 
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.470 align:start position:0%
$1.5 million budget of that we only have
about

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
$200,000 left and that only funded a
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
hand full of projects around the state
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
to mitigate blooms we did some work on
 
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
to mitigate blooms we did some work on
lake

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
lake
 
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
kakka and we have a project plan on
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
Partridge Lake in Littleton this spring
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
and then Tucker pond in Solsbury and
 
00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
Province Lake in Effingham the list is
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
long and I actually of a a print out of
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet of a number of blooms that
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have and we have dozens of water
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
bodies that are impacted by CYO bacteria
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
so the funding is limited so
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
establishing a a license plate program
 
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
would at least provide some degree of
 
00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated funding to this program it may
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
not amount to large amounts annually but
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
it would be some degree of funding that
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
would keep this program going so that we
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
can help Leakes do studies or
 
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
implementation work to help uh reduce
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
the impacts of the
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
blooms uh so unfortunately that funding
 
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
is probably going to be used up in the
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
next couple of months as we have
 
00:26:02.389 --> 00:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
projects coming in having a a program
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
like this would help protect our
 
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
freshwater resources which are used for
 
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
drinking water supplies which are used
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
for recreation for businesses so that
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
that would help a long way so with that
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions um I do
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
want to as I'm part of testimony address
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hill's question for
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
the number of households that could be
 
00:26:28.389 --> 00:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
impacted from cyanobacteria blooms it's
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
a really hard number to predict for
 
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
example a lake like Partridge Lake which
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
is tucked away in Littleton probably has
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
40 homes on it so 40 families there
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
could be affected but if you look at the
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
example of lake kosaka and molteno which
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
probably has about 80 homes on it which
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
is about double that's that's more but
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
Lake kosaka flows into Center Harbor of
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
lake winaki so you're seeing the numbers
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
increase significantly there and the
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
lake kosaka Bloom was documented to flow
 
00:26:59.389 --> 00:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
right into Blacky Cove of of lake winaki
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
so it became a second Lake problem so it
 
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
is sort of a Down The Chain F down the
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
chain follow the flow situation so it
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
time thank you so much any questions
 
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.990 align:start position:0%
from the committee

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
representative CH thank you Mr chair and
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I'm
 
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
running a little late uh if you know um
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
what's the effect of Sino Bia on humans
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
on people so uh we do have a number of
 
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
documented impacts and it depends on the
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
cyanotoxin different cyanobacteria
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
produce different toxins some of the
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
toxins are
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
neurotoxins and some of them are liver
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
toxins some of them can cause dermatitis
 
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
some of them can cause
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
gastroenteritis so it it could be varied
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
um there have been documented cases in
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country where a
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
couple of boys that were swimming in a
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
golf course pond in a of bacteria Bloom
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
died because of their injuries they had
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
um liver necrosis as a result of that so
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
it it could be from mild to severe we
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
haven't had any documented significant
 
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
impacts in New Hampshire to human health
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
at this point but the possibility is
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
always there thank you so much
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you for taking
 
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
my question uh I appreciate it thank you
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um and for the continued
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
response from the prior question um the
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh the handful of projects you mentioned
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
that you're currently um
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
undergoing are those studies or those
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
mitigation or Andor um what kind of
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
average expense are we talking about
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
sure so we've been trying to prioritize
 
00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
the use of cyanobacteria mitigation
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
funds for implementation so actually
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground doing projects so
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
one of them Lake kosak
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
was already done and that was an inl
 
00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
treatment it was an aluminum treatment
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
to when so when leaks have a lot of
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
phosphorus or nutrients coming up from
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
the lake bottom not only do you have all
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
the sources of nutrients coming in from
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
the land surrounding the lake the lake
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
is feeding from within so if we can
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
reduce the external inputs that aluminum
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
treatment will lock phosphorus into the
 
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
lak sediments to keep it from fueling
 
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
that bloom throughout the summer uh we
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
have another one of those planned at
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
part Lake in Littleton and then the
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
other projects Tucker Pond and Province
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
Lake were Watershed projects where we
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
had uh storm water and erosion and
 
00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
sedimentation problems that are being uh
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
imple that are being implemented to
 
00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:43.960 align:start position:0%
mitigate those
 
00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
impacts because the money is so scarce
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to very carefully
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
prioritize those projects and the
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
funding that we're giving is usually
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
already well vetted to be put to good
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
use so those water based studies are
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
already done and updated and ready to
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
go follow up thank you
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
um are the so I'm hearing from um from
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
you that it's not always a man-made um
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
instance that causes these blooms it can
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
be a natural um from the from the lake
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
bed is that what I hear unfortunately no
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
all those nutrients that build up in the
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
bottom of the lake are from typically
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
water shed uses Leakes are settling
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
basins they're the low point in the
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
landscape and they build up materials
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
over time so a lot of that did come
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
originally from The Watershed but when
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
you have it built up to a certain degree
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
in a lake and lakes lose oxygen at the
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
bottom there's a chemical reaction that
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
takes place so it antagonizes the the
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
bloom effect so it is ultimately human
 
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
driven to begin with but it just builds
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
up over time and exacerbates the problem
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh and I didn't answer another part of
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
your question you asked dollar values
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
the a couple of our projects have been
 
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
in the $ 250 to $500,000 range per leak
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
some of them are as small as 10 or
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
$15,000 so they're all over the board it
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
really just depends on what the
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
situation is it's not a one-size fitall
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
every water body has a a pathway forward
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
to remediation and it it has to it it's
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
just varied depending on the project
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
much Cher and I like to recognize lizo
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
it says information only did you want to
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit or sure from the DMV
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
registration hi um I'm Liz mad I'm in
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
charge of the registration Bureau at the
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicles and I really
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
just wanted to we're neutral on this
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
Phill um but I wanted to provide you
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
guys with how things may or may not
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
ffect our operations at the DMV by
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
issuing a new plate type um it's very
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
minimal so there's a minor system change
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
would be needed where we add a new plate
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
type in and then we would get a template
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
made um and send that over to the prison
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
um for production but again it would be
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
very similar to the Moose plates so the
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
financial impact would be very minimal
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
dmbb thank you so much representative
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
representative Crawford
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I saw that the fee
 
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
for making the plate uh well no for the
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
software was you estimated about
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
$25,000 so in the past being on this
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
committee for 12 years um we were always
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
given a a cost of like
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
$240,000 what's changed since then is it
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
just um better software better process
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
and software could you tell it's been
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
streamlined it's a lot easier to add a
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
new plate type now um it doesn't require
 
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
quite as many hours as it did um and
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
also uh since we've been doing this and
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
have some several specialty plates
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
already um adding a new one isn't quite
 
00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:10.629 align:start position:0%
already um adding a new one isn't quite
as

00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
challenging any other questions from the
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%

colleagues uh did a great job um and we
 
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.480 align:start position:0%

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
um presented Before You and I just
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
wanted to take a few minutes to address
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
some of the questions and comments that
 
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
came have come up so far uh so New
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Lakes we have I've been um
 
00:34:40.589 --> 00:34:40.599 align:start position:0%
informally surveying Lake Associations
 
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
for the past three Summers I go out
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
every every weekend to two or three Lake
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
Associations during the summer these
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
Community groups working around their
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
lakes and talk about you know would you
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
be interested in this type of plate um
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
and we you know have a show of hands and
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
we also recently did a Sur survey and
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
about 500 folks um responded to our
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
survey and I saw about a hundred folks
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
signed in online and supported this this
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
bill and our survey was you know one do
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
you have a moose plate um you know if
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
you do have a moose plate would you
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
switch to a lake plate if you don't have
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
a you know moose plate and you register
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would you buy a lake
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
plate to summarize our results uh we
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
found that about 1% of our respondents
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
said I have a moose plate and I would
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
switch um of of our survey population
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
about 25% said they had a moose plate
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
and they would keep the Moose plate but
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
then they would buy a lake plate for
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
their second car um and then about 75%
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
of our survey folks said they don't have
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
a moose plate they're not interested in
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
a moose plate but they would definitely
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
get a lake plate so I do feel that this
 
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be a very um popular uh
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
plate we have 1,000 Lakes uh people will
 
00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
want to buy these first of all to
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
celebrate the Heritage the culture Our
 
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
Lake culture and our heritage here
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
people are proud of that it can also
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
serve as awareness that um our Lakes are
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
fragile and and need to be protected and
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
we can do a whole Outreach campaign
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
about that um and most importantly it
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
would bring in funds to help um the the
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
fund the S bacteria mitigation loan and
 
00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
Grant fund providing loans and grants to
 
00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:28.599 align:start position:0%
community groups to do do the work to
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
improve these Lakes for the benefit of
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
all there is not enough money currently
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
this is not going to solve that deficit
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
but it's going to help and we've got to
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
start somewhere so thank you very much
 
00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh for this opportunity and I I have
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that I passed around I also
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
passed testimony around for the Lakes
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
management advisory committee who is
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
also supporting this bill I'm happy to
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you so much
 
00:36:53.309 --> 00:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
um this is a subject that's near and
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
dear to my heart I think um is um I
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
haven't heard um Landscaping mentioned
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
in this entire talk um and I haven't
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
heard whether that is um is instrumental
 
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
or or part of the problem um with any of
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
the uh uh Landscaping that goes on
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
around around the legs is that something
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
that your organization is concerned
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
about or um spreading any information
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
when you meet with the group about
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's a great question yes
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
how we care for the landscape around the
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
lake um can protect the lake or
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
potentially harm it so you know um we
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
may do things that cause polluted runoff
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
water to come into the lake bringing in
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
fertilizer or something like that so yes
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh we run a Statewide program called the
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
lak smart program it's a lak friendly
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
Living Program and over the past uh four
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
or five years we've worked with over a
 
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
thousand folks throughout the state
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
helping them adopt Lake friendly ways of
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
managing their property around the lake
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
so absolutely that is that is a concern
 
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
um how people care for their properties
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
and and we're here to help people adopt
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
ways to landscape their property in a
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
lak friendly
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
way you're welcome any other questions
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%

00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
cards I have so at this point I'd like
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
to end the testimony on HB 105 our next
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
fill up would be HB 140 uh just give us
 
00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:26.349 align:start position:0%
 
up

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.430 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
right gonna open up the hearing on HB HB
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
140 establishing a voluntary blue
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
envelope program for drivers with autism
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
spectrum disorders and the chair I'd
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
like to recognize representative Newell
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative welcome to Transportation
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
you to the members of the committee for
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
your time and consideration today I'm
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
jod n and I represent chesher 4 in
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
Keem so this bill aims to formalize a
 
00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:35.079 align:start position:0%
system which would Aid in communication
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
between members of law enforcement and
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
drivers with autism spectrum disorders
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
fortunately for us we already have clear
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
guidance on who may qualify and even a
 
00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:45.079 align:start position:0%
comparable program to Aid in
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
communication for folks who are deaf or
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
hard of hearing granted that program is
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
customized to fit the needs of that
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
Community the blue envelope program has
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
been successfully implemented elsewhere
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
including many of our neighbor states
 
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
with essentially the same structure
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
making it an increasingly
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
recognizable uh and therefore commonly
 
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
understood practice it is a voluntary
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
program and the amount of information
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
provided is up to the participant the
 
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
design elements uh it being in an
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
envelope easy to access um uh
 
00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
connectable to the visor um make it for
 
00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
easy and visible
 
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
access by all accounts this is a low
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
lift for the state that can make a world
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
of difference for folks in our community
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
who may struggle with communication in
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
potentially stressful moments as I
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
understand it there have been
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
conversations around adopting the blue
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
envelope program for some time my goal
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
in introducing this legislation is
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
simply uh to underscore our support of
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
immediate action to that effect and uh
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate our resolve to a uh as a
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
body uh to support those community
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
members who B who will benefit from the
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
program's implementation thank you very
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
much I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions from
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chair uh you mentioned
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
several other states uh surrounding that
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
use this program could you tell us what
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
states those are please yeah I know that
 
00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut have uh
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut I think is the most recent
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
one as of last year um and I believe
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
Maine has as well I think
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont sorry I Yes actually I'm sorry
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
yes Vermont yes Connecticut in
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I'm pretty sure about
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
main although I'm not 100% sure it's
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
yet representative Hill thank you Mr
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
chairman um thank you for taking my
 
00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
question um are you aware that uh just
 
00:42:46.109 --> 00:42:46.119 align:start position:0%
last week I think it is when we did our
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
orientation meeting uh the director of
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh DMV mentioned to us that they would
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
be doing this program internally um
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
without the legislation
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
yes I I not particularly that uh that it
 
00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
was brought up in your orientation um
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
but I do know that it's been a
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
conversation for some time I think um
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
what I tried to really get at here is us
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
as a body uh passing legislation to that
 
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
effect I don't think that either one
 
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
cancels out each other uh I think that
 
00:43:18.549 --> 00:43:18.559 align:start position:0%
both of these things work in Tandem and
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
if they get to it before uh our
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
legislation gets through that's great uh
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
I you know either way I think it's
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
wonderful but I don't think that that
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
legislation any other questions from the
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative Au thank you
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
would this just be limited to people
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
with Autism Spectrum Disorder or could
 
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
it be applied to uh broader disorders
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
that might actually have conflicts with
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
police on stops like this this
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
particular program is for folks with
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorders um you know
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't rule out doing something in
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
the future that might uh be able to
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
cater to more people but this particular
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
purpose my my question is kind of
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
followup to representative values the
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorders can you give
 
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
us kind of a list of some of those
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
disorders well I think actually I could
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
refer that to some of the folks who are
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
giving testimony today uh to give a
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
little more um understanding I I
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to um say anything out of
 
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
turn but I know that there are folks
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
here who can speak to that better than I
 
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
can okay thank you any other questions
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing any thank
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
you very much thank
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
you chair i' like to recognize
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative seig who is in support of
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
the bill asking for about two minutes
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative welcome to thank you so
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
much um for the record my name is
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lauren selig and I
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Durham in straford
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
county and I am in favor of this bill um
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
over the past several days I've been
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
rereading reading the bill to make sure
 
00:44:59.829 --> 00:44:59.839 align:start position:0%
that I understood many of the nuances
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
because obviously with all of our
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
legislation there can be very specific
 
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:06.559 align:start position:0%
challenges I then um took the liberty of
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
speaking to a person who oversees police
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
departments um to get a sense of what
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
concerns might be raised as a result of
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
the bill and uh the person I spoke to
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
was initially very skeptical of the idea
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
of a blue envelope program imagining
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
police officers on the side of the road
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
trying to open an envelope and see all
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of things or people fumbling in a
 
00:45:28.589 --> 00:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
glove compartment which could make a
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
police officer feel at risk um but upon
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
rereading the bill and clarifying the
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
fact that the envelopes would be on
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
their uh the visor the sun visor and
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
that the information would be on the
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
outside and an easily located thing um
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
those are things that indicate ways to
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
support communication with police and
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
support the process which could actually
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
make police officers safer in traffic
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
stops um extrapolating from that I also
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
think about the situation where we all
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
know that if we have are in a car
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
accident whether it's a fender bender or
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
more serious incident our adrenaline
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
goes up our you know whole body system
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
has a reaction to that if we're a person
 
00:46:12.589 --> 00:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
on the autism spectrum disorder we may
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
not know how to manage all of those
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
feelings and if someone who is another
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
type of first responder whether a
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
firefighter or an ambulance comes and
 
00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:22.559 align:start position:0%
they've looked on the visor and see oh
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
this person has autism spectrum disorder
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
let me and it says that you know these
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
three words can help calm them down it
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
can make that situation much less
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
dangerous and much safer for everybody
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
involved um it's also the responsibility
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
of the vehicle operator to provide the
 
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
information it's not on the police
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
department and there's no um liability
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
to the police if they haven't seen it
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's not adding a burden it's
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately um working in a way to assist
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
police and support them in supporting
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
people in this situation so for all of
 
00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
these reasons and because I know a lot
 
00:46:58.030 --> 00:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
of people who are the Spectrum I really
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you so much any any U
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
much thank you so
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
much chair and now like to recognize
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler who is in support
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill asking for one minute quite
 
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
suin there representative welcome to
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you chairman Gorski
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
members of the transportation committee
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
always good to see some friendly faces
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
here and congratulations on your
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
appointment chair I know you'll do a
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
good job here with your leadership train
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
just for the day representative W know
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
thinking so I'm just here really quickly
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
to affirm my support as I said I only
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
need a minute because there are people
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
here who can speak
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
more aptly to what this legislation does
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
and and why it's important to have the
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
legislation but I think I affirm the
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
support of Liz Sergeant here at the
 
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
association of Chiefs of police who
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
signed in support of this and and the
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
common sense approach to just making
 
00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
sure that the police are safer and that
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
communication between those who can't
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
communicate as easily but can still
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
drive and between them and the police is
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
is as as uh easy can be to avoid any any
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
potential problems because the police
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
don't want issues and and they're very
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
supportive of this kind of program to
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have that level of
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
communication before the stop to for
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
their own safety but for the safety of
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
the people in the car as well and and I
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
think for the people in the car it's a
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
common sense safe approach for for what
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
we can do here
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
today happy to take any questions but I
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
do also have to get to committee so any
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
any thank you
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative chair now like to
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
Howard who is in support of the bill
 
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
asking for two minutes welcome the
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
transportation representative thank you
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and uh honorable members I I
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
probably shouldn't uh even need two
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
minutes but uh my name is representative
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
Heath Howard I serve the towns of
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
straford and barington in straford
 
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
District 4 and I think that we should be
 
00:49:10.109 --> 00:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
establishing a voluntary blue envelope
 
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
program because it is common sense that
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
we should help improve communication
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
between law enforcement in any way we
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
can while the DMV is in the process of
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
creating this program it has taken over
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
two years without an end date in sight
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
this would create a timeline for the
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
program to be implemented by the start
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
of next year and should be more than
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
enough time for the DMV to
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
comply I think that uh we can all agree
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
that three years should be enough time
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
to implement a program like this and I
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
hope that you agree uh thank you and I'm
 
00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
open to any
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%

00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
sponsors would entertain a amendment to
 
00:49:57.559 --> 00:49:58.990 align:start position:0%
sponsors would entertain a amendment to
include

00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
include
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%

testimony to discuss the benefits of the
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
blue envelope program this program is an
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
essential step toward um improving
 
00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
safety reducing misunder understanding
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
and promoting inclusion for individuals
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
with disabilities within their
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
communities bless you um interactions
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
between law enforcement and individuals
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
with autism disorders of special
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
disorders can often be challenging due
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
to differences in communication Styles
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
sensory sensitivities and behavioral
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
responses Research indicates that people
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
with Autism inspection disorders are at
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
heightened risk of negative outcomes
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
during police interactions due to
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings of their behaviors uh
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
for example uh communication barriers
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
many individuals with ASD struggle with
 
00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
verbal communication which can lead to
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
delayed or atypical responses during
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
high stress situations such as traffic
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
stops officers May misinterpret these
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
behaviors as non-compliance or Defiance
 
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
increasing the likelihood of escalation
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
um behavioral misinterpretation uh
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
common autistic behaviors such as
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
stemming or avoiding eye contact are
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
often misunderstood by law enforcement
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
as signs of nervousness or aggression
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
one study found that 60% of caregivers
 
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
of individuals with autism feared police
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
contact due to concerns about
 
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
misinterpretations um barriers to
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
inclusion um these inter interactions
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
can reinforce systematic barriers
 
00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:30.200 align:start position:0%
preventing individuals with ASD from
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
feeling safe and included in their
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
communities negative experiences with
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can discourage
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
individuals from driving or engaging in
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
community activities that Foster
 
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
Independence and social connections the
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
blue envelope program addresses these
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
challenges by providing a structured
 
00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:45.160 align:start position:0%
straightforward way to communicate
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
essential information research
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
highlights the importance of tools and
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
training to improve interactions between
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and individuals with
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
disability um there's a precedent for
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
Success similar programs implemented in
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
other states have shown promise reducing
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings oring traffic stops um
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's also an inclusion focused outcome
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
um tools like the blue envelope program
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
Empower individuals with disabilities to
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
participate more fully in their
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
Community by removing one of the key
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
barriers to Independent mobility and
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
Community engagement um the blue
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
envelope program offers offers several
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
key benefits um safety for drivers and
 
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
officers by providing law enforcement
 
00:53:18.589 --> 00:53:18.599 align:start position:0%
with information on the driver's
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
communication needs the program reduces
 
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of escalation and fosters
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
a safer environment for all parties
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
involved um empowerment and inclusion um
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
individuals with ASD and the families
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
gain confidence knowing that they have a
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
tool to facilitate smoother interactions
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement um it has a proven
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness um studies suggest that
 
00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
drivers with ASD experience a sta uh
 
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
statistically significant reduction in
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
anxiety and improved preparedness
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
following exposure to tools like the
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
blue envelope program and cost effective
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
with an estimated fiscal impact of less
 
00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
than $10,000 annually the program
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
benefits far away its modest cost um a
 
00:53:53.549 --> 00:53:53.559 align:start position:0%
blue envelope program underscores the
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
importance of removing uh barriers and
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
fostering equity um disability is not
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
merely a medical issue but a social one
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
shaped by the environment and policies
 
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
that either um enable or inhibit um
 
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
inclusion um the blue envelope program
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
represents a proactive solution to a
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
significant issue by fostering better
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
communication understanding and
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
inclusion we can protect individuals
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
with autism while ensuring law
 
00:54:16.349 --> 00:54:16.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers have the tools they
 
00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:18.359 align:start position:0%
need to perform their duties effectively

past that give rise to the to the need
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
for this anecdotally when I was a
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
special education teacher prior to this
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
um a lot of stress and anxiety for
 
00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
students that were going through the
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
driver ed program and not just from the
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
students but from their families um by
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know like poor eye contact or just
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
nervousness in situations that you might
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
not have an everyday experience with a
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people with Autism need a lot of
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
repetition and understanding and this is
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
not something get a lot of practice with
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a lot of um testimony
 
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
from people that have gone through this
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
but I do know I've heard anecdotally
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
from people that do get nervous during
 
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
it actually actually actually have a
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
question that I asked earlier is there a
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
list of the spectrum disorders that this
 
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
falls under it's just autism just autism
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
um yeah autism spectrum disorders is a
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
wide range uh there's level one level
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
two and level three um level one
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
previously um in previous dsms where was
 
00:55:29.710 --> 00:55:29.720 align:start position:0%
more um commonly um called um Asbergers
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
but they have recently um well about a
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
decade or so ago removed that so now
 
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
it's just autism inspection disorders
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
but everyone experiences autism
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
differently so it's really hard to um
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
have a uh Universal you know perceptive
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
perspection on what autism actually is
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
from person to
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
person thank you any other questions
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
representative Fox thank you Mr chair um
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
just to clarify um
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
um um Asbergers does not fall
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
Aspergers is no longer a common
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
definition of autism Aspergers has been
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
so the diagnostic statistics manual four
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
had Aspergers in it as a diagnosis
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
criteria for autism however the dsm5 no
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
longer categorizes um Aspergers they
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
don't um diagnose it anymore now it is
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
um more commonly occur of called um
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
autism level one um but it's it's it's
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
very diverse
 
00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
group follow up so it would fall into
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
the category the blue envelope cat yeah
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
if somebody had a previous diagnosis of
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
autism I would assume that they would um
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
fall under that category thank you any
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee not
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
seeing any thank you so much thank you
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%

00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
director morasco from the DMV who says
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
informational director welcome to
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
Transportation good morning Mr chair
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you so
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to address you
 
00:56:54.270 --> 00:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh my name is John morasco director of
 
00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
the DMV um I just wanted to to say and
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief uh I did have a
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
conversation with representative hill
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
within the last few months uh and he
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention for the first
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
time the blue envelope program um sounds
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
like a wonderful program sounds like
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
something that would really help people
 
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's opt in and so I I heard the
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
testimony about several years in the
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
process I just want to on the record say
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
that this is the first time when the
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative brought it to me that
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
during my tenure at the DMV I've had the
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at it uh we have
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
been making uh strides to um to move
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
forward with this to include I as I
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
testified to uh during our orientation
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to speak with
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
director John Skipper at the New
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police St and Training Academy
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
he thinks it's a wonderful idea there
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
would be a law enforcement training
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
component he's happy to work with us to
 
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh to get there uh when we get to that
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
point I've also spoken with uh office of
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
Highway Safety program manager John CLE
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
about uh the cost that would be
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
associated with production of the blue
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
envelopes and uh John was going to look
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
into that and uh as I testified to I
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
don't think the cost is going to be
 
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelming so even if we can't receive
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
some federal money to support it um for
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
the uh for the voluntary program I'm
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
sure that we could print some of these
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
out through our budget so um I also
 
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
would be interested if the bill passes
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
to work with the sponsor and others who
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
have testified here this morning um to
 
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
roll it out uh and also to make sure
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we have the proper information on
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
the exterior of the uh the envelope
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
itself I know other states are using it
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
but I just want to make sure medically
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're providing the exact information
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we should be that's it's going to
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
help law enforcement and others when
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
they receive the envelope so um I think
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
we need to formalize the process whether
 
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
the bill passes or not we're still uh to
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
the representative's point we're going
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
to keep working towards it and um we're
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
going to make it a priority so just
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to put that on the record and
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
sir any questions from the committee
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative foot thank you Mr chair
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you director so is this a a
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
voluntary thing or something that would
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
need uh proper documentation from a
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
physician or something like that to to
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
get into this program yeah that's that's
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
one area I would like to look at um how
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
how one would um would would get you
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
know the envelope but I I think um we
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
would have to have a conversation on
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
that to see how that would work I
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
mean hopefully people that uh would be
 
00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
taking the envelope would actually need
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
it um and would be using it for for the
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
purposes that it should be used for but
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
I want to have a larger conversation on
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
that part of it thank you any other
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative a thank you for taking my
 
00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
question um what concerns do you have
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
about privacy and training and maybe the
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
administrative aspects of this
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
program excellent question
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
representative um I haven't thoroughly
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
looked at it from that perspective um I
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
I guess based on my understanding of the
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
program and we had um our our admin
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
three administrator 3 Ashley gray uh
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
prepare a beautiful memo on an overview
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
of the program um my understanding based
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
on what I read There is that um there's
 
00:59:56.029 --> 00:59:56.039 align:start position:0%
some bullets on the outside of the
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
envelope that just gives some basic
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
information that you could be dealing
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
somebody with somebody um that is uh has
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
autism um and these are some best
 
01:00:06.029 --> 01:00:06.039 align:start position:0%
practices that you can quickly Implement
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
to improve the communication uh my
 
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the information
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
that would be you know whether it's a
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
driver's license registration any other
 
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
documentation would be inside the
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
envelope um so I don't see it being
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
disclosed or available that way um so I
 
01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's any personal
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
information on the exterior of the
 
01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
envelope but I'd have to look into that
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
I I I will follow up that's a good
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
question okay any other questions from
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
director that memo that you referred to
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
earlier is that something that you can
 
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
make available to the committee so we
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
can follow the discussion absolutely y
 
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's an overview of the program and um
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
as well as what it would take to get it
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
off the ground absolutely thank you
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're welcome sir any other questions
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee not seeing thank you
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chair thank okay with
 
01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
that I have nobody else uh listed for
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
Testimony so at this point I'm going to
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HB 140 our next one
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
coming up is HB 182 just need a few
 
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:35.319 --> 01:02:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
your

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:33.870 align:start position:0%
 
know

01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
all right being uh 11:02 we like to
 
01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
start the public hearing on HB
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
182 prohibiting electric vehicles in
 
01:02:45.549 --> 01:02:45.559 align:start position:0%
commercial parking garages chair like to
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
recognize representative uh Steve
 
01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
Pearson who will be introducing the bill
 
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
are we good there we are there we are
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
all right good morning colleagues um the
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
reason I'm sitting before you
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill real quick is
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
because representative PR is having a
 
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
transportation problem broken down on
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
the side of the highway right now so for
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Representative Steve
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
Pearson rocking Camp District 13 I'm in
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
my fourth term representing
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
Derry and uh I'm doing representative
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
Pro a solid hair
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
so what you have before you is should be
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
familiar this is virtually identical
 
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
language to the bill that was introduced
 
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
ago fortunately I I can speak to the
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
technical aspect of this I've been in
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
the fire service for 27 years I have an
 
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
engineering degree in the practice from
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma State University as well as a
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
master's degree in Emergency Management
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
so I can speak to a little bit of the
 
01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
from a solely engineering standpoint why
 
01:04:01.079 --> 01:04:03.910 align:start position:0%
from a solely engineering standpoint why
this

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
matters electric vehicles due to the
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
nature in which they are constructed do
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
a couple of
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
things and two of the big things and the
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
reason why this bill needs to to exist
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
is because a burning electric vehicle
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
produces a tremendous amount of toxic
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
smoke this is not toxic smoke that you
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
will cough out this is is not toxic
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
smoke that you will take in a large
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
quantity of it's actually quite small
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
it's so small that similar type
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
batteries in
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
scooters can kill you if you live in an
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
apartment so that's the first aspect of
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
this the second one is the the necessary
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
resources that have to respond to put
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
one of these out that's on
 
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
fire a normal carire I've done hundreds
 
01:04:56.589 --> 01:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
of them in my career
 
01:05:01.069 --> 01:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
will require a tank load of water at
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
best these
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles to equate it will require 44
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
engine companies worth of water to put
 
01:05:10.799 --> 01:05:12.390 align:start position:0%
engine companies worth of water to put
out

01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.549 align:start position:0%
out
44

01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
so if you do not have a robust Municipal
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
Water System if you do not have a plan
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
in place to extinguish these you are
 
01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
firefight the sprinkler
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
systems that exist in some parking
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
garages that are up right now were never
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
designed for this type of fire
 
01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.789 align:start position:0%
designed for this type of fire
load

01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
load
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
now this leaves you with a couple of
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
options one you can engage in a
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
substantial firefight it's very risky
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
it's very drawn out it's extraordinarily
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
labor intensive the other option you
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
have is you can hook a vehicle to the
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle that's on fire and try
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
to drag it
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
out now that option which has been used
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge once that I can
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
confirm requires a firefighter to crawl
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
under the car to hook it while it's on
 
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
fire um which I don't necessarily
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
recommend the other thing is to drag a
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
burning electric vehicle out of a
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
parking garage require Ires a truck that
 
01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
will fit in the parking garage in order
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
to remove it so generally speaking that
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
is considered not really an
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
option there are some technological
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
advancements if you will there is a
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
company that sells a cover that you will
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
throw over the electric car with the
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
idea of putting it
 
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
out um those don't really work they do
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
not do anything to change the chemical
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
process the battery burning and they
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
certainly do not provide any cooling
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle okay so what ultimately why do
 
01:07:07.950 --> 01:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
we care well the heat generated from a
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
burning electric vehicle will compromise
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
concrete so we're looking at situations
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
where we could potential aside the fact
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
that the vehicles next to the electric
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle will catch fire from this we're
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
looking at structural concerns of the
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
parking garage
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
that is the importance of this issue so
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
important in fact that New York City has
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
already dealt with it you can't do it in
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
New York
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
City so they've recognized already the
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
problem with the electrical Vehicles
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
burning now keep in mind let's say that
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
we do get the electric vehicle out of
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
the parking garage
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
successfully salvage yards want nothing
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
to do with them the tow truck guys don't
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
like them if they're
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
burning and we have salvage yards now
 
01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
that have created in that's in swimming
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
pools so when these electric vehicles
 
01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
show up they dip they Park them for a
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
month they have to sit for a month in a
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
swimming pool in essence in order to
 
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
ensure that the fire is out it takes a
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
month so looking at the overall
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
situation what is risk risk is
 
01:08:15.789 --> 01:08:15.799 align:start position:0%
probability times
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
severity and I've heard arguments well
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
you know there's been few fires limited
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
fires sure sure but the severity of a
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
fire of an electrical vehicle in a
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
substantial I think this issue needs to
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
be addressed it's not it's been assigned
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of a little bit of a partisan
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
um context to it it's not this is just
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
science this is just dealing with the
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
realities of an electric vehicle
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
so I I support this idea I certainly uh
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
ask for your consideration on it and I'm
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
welcome to uh questions if you have any
 
01:08:58.110 --> 01:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any questions
 
01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:00.759 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Coker
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so my understanding
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
is the reason it takes so much water is
 
01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
because you're really not putting out
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
the fire you're literally having to wait
 
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
energy there are two there are two
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with that one is access right
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
because the majority of electric
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles if I could flip on over yeah
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
that'd be great right but I can't really
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
do that yeah and I certainly can't do
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
that in the confines of a parking garage
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
so um there you know you
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
are you are trying to interfere with a
 
01:09:36.470 --> 01:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
chemical chain reaction and you're
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
trying to do it with something that
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
really isn't designed to do that so the
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
idea the the quantity of water is
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
necessary to cool things down to hope
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
that the Chain Reaction
 
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
slows in order for us to get the vehicle
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
out right that that's that's the only
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
method we have so um
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why they have to dip them
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
that's why the wrecking yards have to to
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
isolate them and dip them in a pool for
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
a month yeah because that's really the
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
only option they have so like literally
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
I mean and that's the the point is like
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
lit oh sorry follow up you're you're
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
literally having to um just let them
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
burn themselves out you really it's very
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to interrupt that
 
01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.630 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to interrupt that
chemical

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
chemical
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
reaction yep you are
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
correct representative
 
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
Jason thank you Mr chair so am I correct
 
01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
in interpreting this as all parking
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
garages in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
not municipal or state-owned but all
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
parking garages in the state of
 
01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't have a copy of it in
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
front of me so I'll have to
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
remember but the language is the
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
language is in front of
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
you follow up we have several major
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
Employers in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
who've invested in charging stations in
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
their employees parking garages and and
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
encourage their employees to charge
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
there is there
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
any thing that we are going to do to
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
lessen the impact on the companies that
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
have paid for this service for their
 
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
employees on their private property in
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
their private garages sure those private
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
companies on private property carry
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
insurance I bet and when the Risk
 
01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
Managers and the inspectors which an
 
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
industry that I was in prior to being in
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
the fire service in New Hampshire come
 
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
and inspect those facilities the dollar
 
01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
will tell them what to do with that if
 
01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
if this legislature does not because the
 
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
the risk associated with the fire and
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
the loss associated with that garage and
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
other things the insurance companies
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest in having an
 
01:11:32.719 --> 01:11:35.070 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest in having an
opinion

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
on representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:11:42.189 --> 01:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
question representative um my
 
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
understanding from the previous time
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
this bill came before us we had a
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
discussion as well uh with
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative PR about um the toxicity
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
of the of the water that is used within
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
the garage and how that can um find its
 
01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
way to water sources uh drinking water
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
sources nearby um that was one issue
 
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
that was brought up and I wonder if you
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
could speak on that the other issue um U
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
that was brought up a couple of times
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
here was the weight and I'm wondering if
 
01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's been any um changes in building
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
codes for new construction um and and
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
how those
 
01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
judg to Prior building codes do you know
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay so as far as your three-part
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
question the the first part with the
 
01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
toxicity um all burning vehicles that we
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
put out unfortunately the water runoff
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
does contain all kinds of stuff um in an
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle situation the car
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
itself is really generally no different
 
01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
than any other car it's just a fuel cell
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
um and it would depend if the fuel cell
 
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
ruptured or not ultimately as far as
 
01:12:56.229 --> 01:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
that element of it
 
01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
entertaining wherever the water goes
 
01:13:00.669 --> 01:13:00.679 align:start position:0%
we're not going to wa we are not going
 
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
to focus on water runoff in these
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
situations we don't have the Manpower
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
we're struggling to find water and we're
 
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to keep our
 
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
people safe the runoff of that is at
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
least of our worries but after the fact
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
it will have to be dealt with no doubt
 
01:13:16.629 --> 01:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
but it's going to depend if the fuel
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
cell ruptures are not as to the severity
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
of that um you mentioned weight I'll
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
give you an example of weight a an
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
electric Hummer
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
the battery pack alone weighs more than
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
a Honda Civic just the batteries that
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the whole vehicle so it
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
is there is no doubt that the weight
 
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
issue is not has not been factored into
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
the construction of existing garages now
 
01:13:42.270 --> 01:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
as far as code changes go I'm not sure I
 
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
sit on Edna we're looking at the next
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
update of codes that are going to be
 
01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
brought in and I'm not sure what has
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
changed as far as the structural um
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
requirements within a parking garage if
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's been addressed or
 
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
not but it will it will certainly need
 
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't quick follow up follow up um
 
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
should have should have asked this in my
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
list of questions but um aside from
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
parking garages um as with your
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
professional experience would there be a
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
need as we do I believe with things like
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh gas stations and and fireworks stores
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
not putting them next to schools or or
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities or any of
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
that is there would there be any need
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
for any of that not really as far if
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
they're outside no no it's it's just
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
another Hazard it's just another thing
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
that we deal with in the fire service um
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
if I have a burning electric vehicle
 
01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.669 align:start position:0%
if I have a burning electric vehicle
that's

01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
outdoors I have a couple of better
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
options I don't I'm not in confined
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
space it's a lot easier to operate um
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
again they're ultimately if you do have
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
to drag it away it is extraordinarily
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
somebody at the vehicle to hook a chain
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
to it but um you know I have a sticker
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
inside my helmet that says firefighting
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
is an ultra hazardous profession we're
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
not disillusioned to that so I I don't I
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't see that as a as something that's
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
over the top when it comes to just
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
proximity of things this is really about
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
confining an electric vehicle in a
 
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:26.629 align:start position:0%
confining an electric vehicle in a
struct

01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
struct
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
that is not designed to handle what is
 
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
about to come from it that that's really
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
what it's about so um you know that as
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
far as proximities to schools and
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
there's there's that's not really
 
01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
necessary any other questions from the
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative Coker thank you
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman U charging increases the
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
risk of a fire
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
correct active charging sure I mean you
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
have um I mean that that holds true with
 
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
with this that holds true with my
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
Milwaukee battery pack for my tools yeah
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
anytime that you a lithium ion battery
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
is charged there is potential so you
 
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.070 align:start position:0%
is charged there is potential so you
know

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's this is not a matter of okay well
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't charge in parking garages
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
we'll I think we'll be fine that's
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's not really the issue here because
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
these vehicles have have burned and
 
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
caught fire when they were not in the
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
mode of charging thank
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
sites thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
representative to take my question um so
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
as far as you am I correct in
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that as far as you know uh
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
the National Fire Protection Association
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
has not adopted any changes relative to
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
garages well it's funny you mentioned
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
the nfpi I worked as a technical adviser
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
for that organization and spent 15 years
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
as a certified fire protection
 
01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
specialist from the NFPA um I why I'm
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
asking the question it has been a long
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
time since I worked for them um I know
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
that electric vehicles have been
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
addressed by the NFPA as a as a special
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
hazard class that's something that is
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
ongoing with that process within the
 
01:17:16.229 --> 01:17:16.239 align:start position:0%
fire codes um as to exactly what the
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
NFPA has done within the code I'm not
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
entirely sure but I do know this the
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has not adopted
 
01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
that nfba standard so there therefore
 
01:17:28.709 --> 01:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
has no effect in no rule of law
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
here representative foot thank you Mr
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure uh as far as
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
these fires with these electric vehicles
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
do they have any causation that we know
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
of what what causes them to catch on
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
fire like with a regular gas powered
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle a lot of times could be like a
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
oil leak or whatnot so with the EVS how
 
01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
does that sure I mean you
 
01:17:58.110 --> 01:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
generally

01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:18:02.669 --> 01:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
speaking it's a it's a it's the Chain
 
01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
Reaction within the battery that goes a
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
muck right that that's the
 
01:18:10.030 --> 01:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
oversimplification of the answer to that
 
01:18:12.790 --> 01:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
right so as far as like the way the
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
investigators work EVS it's tough
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
because you have to look at the look at
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
the EV after it's out so it's going to
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
sit in a pool for a month right and then
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
what are we looking at here so generally
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
they're not D they're not dissecting
 
01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles my fire investigators
 
01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't do that in the city it's a that's
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
the cause we know what the cause is it's
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
the electric vehicle caught fire now are
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
there Specialists that exist that look
 
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
at those there probably are I don't know
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
of it I don't know any personally but um
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
I would think the manufacturers would be
 
01:18:50.430 --> 01:18:50.440 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest underwriter's
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
laboratory Tesla those folks would have
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
a vested interest in looking at
 
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
causation but um as far as you know at a
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
municipal level that that's not that's
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
not something we really have in New
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative sites thank you
 
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman thank you
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative sure
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
um are you I guess I'm trying to I'm
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
struggling with the
 
01:19:19.149 --> 01:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
um the the numbers of actual electrical
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle fires in parking garages that we
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
have as it as uh raw numbers I
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
mean is it not fair to say
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
that um we try to look at risk as the
 
01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
likelihood that something happens and
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
the frequency that it does happen will
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
change the way we look at the risk isn't
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
that isn't that how both the NFPA and
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and actually
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters fire uh making decisions on
 
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
the fire ground is that not the basis
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
under which they make decisions yeah
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
like I said probability times severity
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
right so yes the we don't have electric
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
vehicles burning up in New Hampshire
 
01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:02.360 align:start position:0%
every day that that's just not happening
 
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
but the problem is we also don't have
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plants melting down in New
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire every day either but we have a
 
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
substantial substantial amount of safety
 
01:20:13.110 --> 01:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
that goes into seabook right because the
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
probability is extraordinarily low but
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
the severity is fairly substantial and
 
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
that's the same situation with these in
 
01:20:19.709 --> 01:20:19.719 align:start position:0%
a parking
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
garage we could go 10 years without one
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
but the first time we have one and it's
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
on the first floor and we drop a parking
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
garage then we're looking at we're
 
01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:31.719 align:start position:0%
looking at some serious issues we're
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
looking at some serious concerns again
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
for the heal the welfare and the safety
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
of our firefighters so that that's just
 
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
risk any other questions from the
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative chair now recognizes
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Smith
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
who's representing herself who opposes
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
the bill who is asking for 2 minutes
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
welcome to Transportation I got it right
 
01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.110 align:start position:0%
welcome to Transportation I got it right
this

01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
time okay thank you
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair and and members of the
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
committee um I I think this topic will
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
require a lot of exploration and um I I
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
want to First just say I've been driving
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
eeve for over 10 years and because the
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
early batteries were pretty small um it
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
it was impossible to get to things in
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
Hanover and Portsmouth both places I
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to go in fact I was studying
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
Public Health um at uh Dartmouth at the
 
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
time that I first bought an electric
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle um and the presence of chargers
 
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
in parking garages is kind of essential
 
01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
then and if you're going further and
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to be there for a while it's rather
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
important too
 
01:21:58.110 --> 01:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
um outdoor Chargers are fine that's
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay but there are Chargers in
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
first floor in Portsmouth there are
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
Chargers in first floor in handle now
 
01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
those are cities they're
 
01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.750 align:start position:0%
those are cities they're
Municipal

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
um there is at darmouth Hitchcock
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
Medical Center a series of chargers that
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
are on an upper floor I don't know
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
whether that's considered really safer
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
it would take a whole lot longer for
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
Fire Equipment
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
to and quick research I don't find much
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
about parking garage fires and I don't
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
think the charging is much of an issue I
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
think the um people who do the charging
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
and I've charged in many places across
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
the Northeast um are pretty careful as
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
are the manufacturers to be better about
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
the safety of all of
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
that and the only thing I've seen is
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
actually um from seal Korea um there was
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
a vehicle in a parking garage not
 
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
charging that caught fire and caused
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
extensive damage so there are a lot of
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
EVS in the world
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
um Norway is on track for
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
80% uh new car sales being electric
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
because they have such good electric
 
01:23:30.510 --> 01:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
sources and it's so much more
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
environmentally and economically
 
01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for them and probably within
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of years 100% of their new
 
01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
vehicles will be electric not heard much
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
in the way of issues I think you know
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
yes there have been issues so that's I
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
think speaks to
 
01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
frequency um I I hope you will look at
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
this carefully and yeah there are
 
01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
some solutions I
 
01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
think but I have been following this
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
issue of electric vehicle fires since it
 
01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
was raised to me a few years ago in a
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
town meeting considering whether we
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
might get electric vehicles for um
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
certain Town uses we actually have a
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
electric tra truck going in clearly that
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
will be outdoors but that is a huge
 
01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:26.199 align:start position:0%
battery um and I wouldn't point out that
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
a Hummer uh would also have a huge
 
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
gasoline or diesel I don't know if they
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
do diesel Hummers um that could
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
compromise a parking garage too I I
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
think these things are becoming less
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
frequent as safety measures have been
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
put in um I have not yet heard of a
 
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
burning electric vehicle in New
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but we don't have as many but
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
there are many places that do have lots
 
01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
of electric vehicles and by the way I
 
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
have charged inside parking structures
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
in New York City it is now actually a
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
law in New York to mandate that parking
 
01:25:13.629 --> 01:25:13.639 align:start position:0%
structures put in EV charging level two
 
01:25:15.950 --> 01:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
charging occurs pretty slowly but that's
 
01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
the ideal place is when you're
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
parking level three charging when you're
 
01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
traveling across the country might be
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
more risky but I have not heard of fires
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
at a level three any place I've been um
 
01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
and probably there have been somewhere
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
the two fires in New York City from
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
charging uh
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
electric bikes were
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
devastating but they were due to
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
improper equipment not matched to the
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
batteries um and they were not the toxic
 
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
smoke which is real um but it was
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
actually the building things catching on
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
fire from people doing
 
01:26:00.430 --> 01:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
that so I I think you know you need to
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
study this a lot more carefully before
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
doing that and speak to those who have
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
Chargers dmouth
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock in Lebanon um the Handover
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
garage which you know they charge so is
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
that commercial I don't know it's
 
01:26:18.629 --> 01:26:18.639 align:start position:0%
Municipal but it is commercial in the
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
sense that they charge and Portsmouth
 
01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
which has two garages with electric
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
charges within them
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
um so I think you need to think
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
carefully about that and um I would hope
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
you don't pass this
 
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
bill any questions from the
 
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
much chair now like to recognize Chris
 
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
skand from clean energy New
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who is asking for three
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
minutes who is opposing the bill welcome
 
01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.109 --> 01:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Chris scogland I'm
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
the director of energy transition with
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
clean energy New Hampshire uh we're
 
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
often thought of as a treat group but we
 
01:27:08.109 --> 01:27:08.119 align:start position:0%
represent uh a membership that includes
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
up to 40 municipalities representing
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
about a third of the state's population
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
all three of the states electrical
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
utilities and Natural Gas Utilities as
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
well as
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh many businesses residents and other
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organizations that are
 
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
partnering with us to ensure that as
 
01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:28.639 align:start position:0%
technology advances we're adopting the
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
most advantageous policies for our
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
economy we do oppose this bill um in
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
part because the evidence does not
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
suggest that EVS pose as high a risk
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's a low probability there may be
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
risks that are associated with it but uh
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
more recent studies suggest that
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engines otherwise
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
referred to as ice vehicles uh burn
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
between 25 and 29 times more frequently
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a significant a larger
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
part of the fires that we see um this is
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
repeated in the US but then in countries
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
where we have adoption of EVS up to 90%
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
such as Norway
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
um they are likewise seeing very low uh
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
fires uh we're concerned that this uh
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
issue um is we're picking a solution
 
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
without quite studying it yet and uh I
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
believe it was Senate bille 431 last
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
session created the lithium battery fire
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
Council um which enshrined a group that
 
01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:31.159 align:start position:0%
had been convened by the fire marshall
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
Shan Tumi and several uh state agencies
 
01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
and fire departments are representing on
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
that uh clean energy New Hampshire is
 
01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
not a named member but we do uh attend
 
01:28:45.390 --> 01:28:45.400 align:start position:0%
those meetings and they are getting
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
regular updates from the national uh
 
01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
level agencies that have more resources
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
and are studying this issue uh what was
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
generally observed is that they were
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
saying the data is inconclusive and it
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
needs more study and so at this point it
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
feels premature we are uh supportive of
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
fire safety and do appreciate uh
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative Peru and Pearson's
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
contributions and dedication through
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
their time in the fire service but we
 
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're not putting a
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
mandate on municipalities where they are
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
enforcing something that maybe the data
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
does not yet support and and so rather
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
than put this in place we would
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
recommend that it be sent to the
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
fire lithium battery fire Council um for
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
them to investigate similar to how we
 
01:29:37.830 --> 01:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
send things to the building code review
 
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
board and the board of fire safety to
 
01:29:41.229 --> 01:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
make recommendations to the building
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
code and the fire code before it comes
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
back to the House and Senate Edna
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
committees thank you any questions from
 
01:29:49.199 --> 01:29:50.270 align:start position:0%
committees thank you any questions from

01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
much thank you
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%

chair would now like to recognize
Zeke

01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
Zeke
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
ISO got it um representing himself who's
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill who's asking for two
 
01:30:07.629 --> 01:30:07.639 align:start position:0%
to three minutes so welcome to
 
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
Transportation sir hi thank you first
 
01:30:13.390 --> 01:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
time I ever do this is very exciting um
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
my name is zeky I'm a resident of
 
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
Kensington very small town I will say I
 
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
have no uh background that would be able
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
to help me in this case in terms of
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
safety and like everything we hear from
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
fire departments about the safety of EVS
 
01:30:31.629 --> 01:30:31.639 align:start position:0%
um but I do have engineering background
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
which I've used uh extensively when I uh
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
talk about these issues with the
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
community not just fires but uh people
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about all sorts of things with
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
EVS uh you know spontaneously Catching
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
Fire is one that is very interesting
 
01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:45.800 align:start position:0%
because of course it's not what we're
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
talking about right we're talking about
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
when an EV is uh damage that will cause
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
a fire like this the incense of ev's uh
 
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
being so low the fire EV fire is being
 
01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
so low compared to Ice uh as reported by
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh there's lots of research that has
 
01:31:03.149 --> 01:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
been done on this but of course like
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
like we heard it's very difficult
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes to determine if the fire was
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
caused by something wrong with the EV
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
the point is that there was an EV fire
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
um it does all point to there being
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
significantly less fire uh risk of an
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
Eevee I have been uh in talks with our
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
fire department because I am trying to
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
understand from their point of view like
 
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
you know what what is the risk what is
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
the concern and a lot of times we talk
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
about Outdoors kington is very small we
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
definitely don't have any garages uh but
 
01:31:33.149 --> 01:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
the concern seems to be what we heard uh
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
initially which was that uh putting out
 
01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
an EV fire can take a lot of water uh
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
and when we're talking about a garage
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
that is something that I would hope is
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration when we're
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
talking about safety um what I'm
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
confused about after hearing everything
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
with comments about weight for example
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
um comparably speaking same size cars
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
are not that much different I just was
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
hoping that you all would know for
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
example Tesla Model 3 weighs uh roughly
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
as much as a BMW 300 series uh it's
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
3,800 lb 4,000 lb uh similar with uh
 
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
other cars but my point is in that it's
 
01:32:15.629 --> 01:32:15.639 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't the garage need a way to
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
be able to figure out if the cars
 
01:32:20.109 --> 01:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
they're allowing in are going to be
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
structurally damaging the structure
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
right like there are high limitations
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's a great way of doing it right a
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
very large diesel truck will probably
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
weigh more than a Tesla Model 3 as a
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I know that they do uh a
 
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
Hummer will probably not fit into the
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
Portsmith garage ice or EV right uh so
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
weights I'm not seeing the concern there
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
I would hope that the engineers behind
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
the garage would have a say in it not
 
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
the law right like laws are supposed to
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
be preventing things that are
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
unpreventable I would say um and so from
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
the from that point of view I really
 
01:32:55.229 --> 01:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
don't understand why that argument is
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
brought up so often but I can understand
 
01:32:59.149 --> 01:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
it right it's it is a concern if if the
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
weight is a problem um we should address
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
it I just don't think that the data is
 
01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
there to back up that claim EV fires
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
again we've already heard the likelihood
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
of new EV fire is much lower so I don't
 
01:33:16.109 --> 01:33:16.119 align:start position:0%
risk and um related to how we do risk
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
assessment I'm not qualified to do that
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
right but I would believe that given how
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
few EVS there are in New Hampshire and
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
even then the rate being 30 40 50 times
 
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
less likely that an Eevee catches fire
 
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
that we would take that into
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
consideration and as a matter of fact I
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
did do a little more research into that
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of insurance insurance is a
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
great way to know if these claims are
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
true or not right that's the market
 
01:33:43.149 --> 01:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
speaking like yes we believe that EVS
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
are a worse uh they're they're worse for
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
us and as an insurance company uh and I
 
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
called them because uh I do regret to
 
01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
say maybe not regret uh I have a little
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
bit of Shame sometimes when I speak
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
publicly I have a cyber truck a test of
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
cyber Tru which is very controversial
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that uh getting
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
insurance on it everyone was very
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
concerned that it was going to be a
 
01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
problem uh turns out to be much cheaper
 
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
than my other cars which is surprising
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
but I did call the insurance company
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
because I wanted to know why right why
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
is it cheaper and aren't you guys
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
concerns with the fires uh and why is my
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
other car so much more expensive and
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
they said that they first of all the the
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
data isn't there yet so they are
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
catching up so if in the future this
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
does come up where it turns out that
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
fires EV fires are a big concern I'm
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
sure that they going to be insurance
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
companies speaking about this but so far
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
they don't think that's a reason at all
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's actually related to the complexity
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
of the cars themselves right if you bump
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
into a mailbox and it cost $10,000 to
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
fix because of all the technology in
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
there that's the insurance going up and
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
as it turns out a lot of the new cars
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of what engine they're
 
01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
running have this problem so that's why
 
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
Insurance prices have been going up from
 
01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
the research I've done again I'm not a I
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
I have no actual technical background in
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
this um and so I would definitely be
 
01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
against the bill of course I drive only
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
electric cars a lot of my friends Drive
 
01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
electric cars not being able to park in
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
the garage would suck I mean it's not
 
01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's not terrible right there's
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
parking everywhere thankfully um other
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
than conquer it was impossible to find
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
parking here but uh where I am it's not
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
that big of a concern and and of course
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
if it makes it safer for everybody
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
totally makes sense but I do follow uh
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
the Rockingham uh emergency services and
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
there are fires all the time car fires
 
01:35:33.629 --> 01:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
and I will say to date there have been
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
there's been one and it was actually
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
costed by an electric uh an ice car next
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
to it that caught fire and then the
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
older Tesla CAU fire due to that um yeah
 
01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of my what I would
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
like to say and of course please oppose
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
the bill I I don't see how how it would
 
01:35:54.109 --> 01:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
be helpful at this point Thank you any
 
01:35:56.550 --> 01:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
comments or any questions from the
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
question at one point um when we had
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
testimony prior uh on a prior bill um
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
same topic uh it was pointed out or it
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
was uh mentioned that the owner manuals
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
EVS um indicated that they would prefer
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
um fast charging only be done in
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
emergencies or are are you aware of such
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
a comment inside your inside your safety
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
manual uh no that that is not something
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
that I've seen recommended I've actually
 
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
read a lot of the the manuals because
 
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
there are sometimes there are concerns
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
that people get confused about well if
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
it says it in the manual why aren't
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
people following it a great example is
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
car washes you might have heard that
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
people say that you shouldn't run an EV
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
through a car wash because they will
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
destroy it uh that's a very popular one
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
and it's turns out the manual does say
 
01:36:57.950 --> 01:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
to be to be careful with automatic car
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
washes um but it turns out that it's for
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
reasons that people don't totally
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
understand because most cars have Car
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
Wash mode which will disable that in
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
terms uh it'll disable the the features
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
that would cost issues like the uh gas
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
or the the EV charging port opening up
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
mid uh washing which would then get
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
water into the charge board which could
 
01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
damage the electronics not a safety
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
concern because everything is grounded
 
01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
properly usually uh but again in terms
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
of the manual talking about charging not
 
01:37:30.510 --> 01:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
at all uh technically speaking right if
 
01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
we did actually get into the specifics I
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
usually don't because people don't like
 
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
to hear Math and Science but uh DC
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
charging fast charging level three we're
 
01:37:42.669 --> 01:37:42.679 align:start position:0%
talking uh 800 amps usually 400 volts
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
right so uh this is anywhere up to 250
 
01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:48.639 align:start position:0%
kilow this is a large three-face direct
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
current Transformer that is installed
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
usually uh to power these it's it's not
 
01:37:56.189 --> 01:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
new equipment right this has been around
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
for 50 60 80 years uh the all the rage
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
about uh safety with EVS is not really
 
01:38:09.589 --> 01:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
grounded on usually on the data um it
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
seems to be more on user error or
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes really bad Hardware right like
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
you do get bad Hardware all across the
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
industry on every type of uh electrical
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
equipment but the safety features have
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
gone a long way these past few years
 
01:38:26.950 --> 01:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
right a charger will not let you the
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
Tesla charger that I have for example it
 
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
will not let you charge if it's not
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
properly grounded it can detect that
 
01:38:33.790 --> 01:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
right I can't say the same
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
for uh you know every piece of uh
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
charging equipment that every EV has but
 
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
I will be very surprised if it was
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
actually a a widespread concern thank
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
much chair now like to recognize Jessica
 
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
Wilcox for the the New Hampshire
 
01:38:58.109 --> 01:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
Dees who is asking for 3 to five minutes
 
01:38:59.790 --> 01:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if you support or oppose the
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
bill welcome to Transportation thank you
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
honorable honorable chair and members of
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
the committee Jessica Wilcox with the
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and for Dees um I
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
oversee a bureau that is uh focused on
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation programs and projects a
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
lot of which funding goes to our
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities and such so we've been
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
putting a lot of money out there
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
um Dees takes no specific position on
 
01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
this bill but wants to offer some
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
information and resources for
 
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
consideration so Chris goland mentioned
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
in the 2024 legislative session Senate
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 430 was passed which established an
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle in lithium ion battery
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
study Council that is chaired by the
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshall Shan Tumi um Dees
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
has a position on that on that uh
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
Council as well and that council is
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
tasked with study among other issues the
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
impacts to the built environment um and
 
01:39:59.589 --> 01:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
will'll ultimately be making
 
01:40:02.350 --> 01:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations using evidencebased data
 
01:40:04.510 --> 01:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
so the interim report was submitted on
 
01:40:07.470 --> 01:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
November 1st of 2024 and there is a
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
final report that is due this November
 
01:40:14.589 --> 01:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
so based on de's analysis of some 2024
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh Department of Motor
 
01:40:18.990 --> 01:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
Vehicle vehicle registration data of the
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
nearly 1.7 million vehicles that are
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
currently register registered in New
 
01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.270 align:start position:0%
currently register registered in New
Hampshire

01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
approximately 14,700 of those are
 
01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:27.950 align:start position:0%
approximately 14,700 of those are
electric

01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
electric
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles EV fire occurrence in New
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is low and per data from the
 
01:40:35.910 --> 01:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 430 interim report um the
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department actually requested
 
01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
data from their industry in mid July of
 
01:40:42.910 --> 01:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
last year and a survey of the largest 10
 
01:40:45.390 --> 01:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
Underwriters of private passenger auto
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
insurance in New Hampshire for the
 
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
period of January 20th through June 2024
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
showed the total number of fire claims
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
related to battery electric vehicles was
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
three the total number of fire claims
 
01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
related to battery hybrid vehicles was
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
one so that's a period of 2020 of
 
01:41:06.390 --> 01:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
January 2020 through June of
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
2024 the State Fire Marshals office also
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
perform some data drilling into
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
narratives of reports that were
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
submitted to the National fire incident
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
reporting system over the past two years
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshall's office is
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
aware of five vehicle fires three of
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
which were the result of accidents and
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is compared to approximately 400
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle fires reported in New Hampshire
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
each year so this council is researching
 
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
and documenting data that pertains to
 
01:41:38.030 --> 01:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
the impacts of EVS on the safety and
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
structural soundness of a parking garage
 
01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
as per the interim report the
 
01:41:45.910 --> 01:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
International Code Council UL Fire
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
Safety Research Institute Factory mutual
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the NFPA fire protection Research
 
01:41:53.229 --> 01:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
Foundation all have studies underway to
 
01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
evaluate these impacts on parking
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
garages it's anticipated that these
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
results from these studies are expected
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
in the coming year so kind of what I'm
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
building up to is there's a lot of
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
research happening and this Council that
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
that I'm participating in Senate Bill
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
430 is looking to kind of gather up all
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
that research and package that in that
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
in that final report so therefore Dees
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
does ask that the committee consider
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
referring this bill to interim study and
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
allow the Senate Bill 430 Council to
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
complete this work and just a few
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
additional considerations
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
so during the 2024 legislative session a
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
similar Bill HB 1332 FN relative to
 
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
prohibiting EVS from parking and parking
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
garages Was Heard and was ultimately
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
voted itl and that didn't specify
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
commercial parking garages so that's
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
something unique to this to this piece
 
01:42:41.159 --> 01:42:41.910 align:start position:0%
something unique to this to this piece
of

01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
legislation um additionally existing
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
parking structures are likely sufficient
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
for future electric vehicle loads and
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
this is per a July 2024 scholarly
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
article us building codes have long
 
01:42:56.229 --> 01:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
recommended designing parking garage
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
floors for what are called live loads
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
and these are loads that are subject to
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
change right because cars are moving
 
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
around um those live loads generally are
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
about 40 pounds per square foot and so
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
this is how parking garages have been
 
01:43:10.589 --> 01:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
structured so they're already
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
anticipating that this is there's going
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
to be some flexib fluctuation there and
 
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
some flexibility so they're already
 
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
designed to take the expected future
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle loading I can give you
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
a link to that article after this um in
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
followup to this the weight of an EV
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
does impact its battery range so
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
although there are concerns about EVS
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
being so heavy automakers have an
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
urgency to lighten that load right to
 
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
reduce their weight and they're
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
continually working on ways to reduce
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
that weight so what we're seeing is the
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
exponential battery progress of Battery
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
Technology is likely going to result in
 
01:43:48.669 --> 01:43:48.679 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles eventually becoming
 
01:43:52.510 --> 01:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
lighter Dees did perform a did perform a
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
curb w comparison of the top highest
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
selling electric vehicles and their
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
comparable gasoline counterparts and
 
01:44:01.270 --> 01:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
what we found is that on average there's
 
01:44:02.910 --> 01:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
a difference of approximately a th000
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
pounds and I can kind of give you that
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
breakdown as
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
well additionally we're starting to see
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle weight Trends in general
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
increasing right this is called car blo
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
um the average vehicle weight over the
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
last uh 40 years has increased by a
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
thousand by approximately a th000 pounds
 
01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
and in the United States as most people
 
01:44:24.589 --> 01:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
know City and station wagons and pickup
 
01:44:27.750 --> 01:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
trucks have largely replaced um or SUVs
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
and pickup trucks have largely replaced
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
SED Dan and station wagons they now
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
account for about four in every five new
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
car purchase um at the same time
 
01:44:38.109 --> 01:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
individual vehicle models are getting
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
heavier we talk about all that new
 
01:44:41.350 --> 01:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
technology that's coming on board right
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
a 2024 Chevrolet Silverado pickup for
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
instance is around 700 lbs heavier and 2
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
in taller than the 1995 Edition so we're
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
seeing that vehicles are increasingly
 
01:44:53.550 --> 01:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
getting heavier
 
01:44:55.149 --> 01:44:55.159 align:start position:0%
and according to Federal data the
 
01:44:56.870 --> 01:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
average new American car now weighs
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
around 30% more than it did 40 years ago
 
01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:02.599 align:start position:0%
um but if parking garage are structured
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
to anticipate this weight growth which
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
is what we're reading um they're
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
prepared to manage that that increase so
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
vehicle weight Trends did ini initially
 
01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:14.119 align:start position:0%
decrease but have been in steadily uh
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
steadily increasing over the years
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%
earlier from model year 1975 to 81
 
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
average vehicle weight actually dropped
 
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
21% from 4,60 lb per vehicle to about
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
3200 lb so parking garages built in the
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
1970s they were accommodating that 4,000
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
lound weight and what we're seeing on
 
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
average is for most um electric vehicles
 
01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:39.639 align:start position:0%
4,000 lbs is kind of the the average the
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
average weight uh so model year 2004
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
average new vehicle weight has actually
 
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
increased across the board 28% and
 
01:45:48.990 --> 01:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
currently has reached about 4,000 lbs
 
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
per vehicle that's ice if you will
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engine as well as
 
01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:53.430 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engine as well as
Electric

01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
Electric
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle um with all of this information
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
in mind and in consideration of the
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
continuing good work of the Senate Bill
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
430 Council Dees does ask that the
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee consider referring this bill
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
to interim study and certainly I'm happy
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
to provide this information
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
electronically with links to these
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
resources a copy of the Senate Bill 430
 
01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
interim report if that would please the
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
committee that's all I have to share
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
today thank you that would be great if
 
01:46:18.910 --> 01:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
you can get that to us any questions
 
01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question did did I hear
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
correctly that of the approximately 400
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle fires in New Hampshire each year
 
01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
that for the first half of last year
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
there were three that involved an
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle so over the past two
 
01:46:45.149 --> 01:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
years the State Fire Marshalls Office is
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
aware of five electric vehicle fires
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
three of which were the result of
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
accidents and that's compared to the 400
 
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
or so fires reported in New Hampshire
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
every year so on an annual basis about
 
01:46:58.990 --> 01:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
400 in the past two years five electric
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up and were any of
 
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
those in a commercial parking lot do you
 
01:47:07.149 --> 01:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
know that I don't know but the State
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's Office may they collected
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
that data so I can certainly ask them
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much for your time
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
do you have written testimony as well
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's not it was informally written but
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly happy to provide it as a
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
followup okay that would be great thank
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
with that I don't see any anybody else
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
who wants to testify so I'm going to
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on HB 182 our next
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill just give a few few minutes will be
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:58.149 --> 01:47:58.159 align:start position:0%
there there is the opportunity uh to
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:08.679 align:start position:0%
afterwards um I would add it in in
 
01:48:51.310 --> 01:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
this one going
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
all right being uh 11:47 like to open up
 
01:48:59.550 --> 01:48:59.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing on HB 260 creating a
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
commemorative license plate celebrating
 
01:49:01.599 --> 01:49:02.470 align:start position:0%
commemorative license plate celebrating
the

01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
250th anniversary of Bunker Hill and the
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
chair would like to recognize
 
01:49:09.159 --> 01:49:11.669 align:start position:0%
chair would like to recognize
representative

01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
Pearson welcome back the prime sponsor
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
all right this will be a lot more
 
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
fun for the record Representative Steve
 
01:49:22.109 --> 01:49:22.119 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District 13 which is
 
01:49:24.189 --> 01:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
encompasses is the town of
 
01:49:27.629 --> 01:49:27.639 align:start position:0%
dairy so what house bill 260 is looking
 
01:49:31.229 --> 01:49:31.239 align:start position:0%
to do is to to create a one-year
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
commemorative state plate in honor of
 
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
the 250th anniversary of the Battle of
 
01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:36.990 align:start position:0%
the 250th anniversary of the Battle of
Bunker

01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
Bunker
 
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
Hill um I am a published historical
 
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
author not not on the Revolutionary War
 
01:49:45.310 --> 01:49:45.320 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
01:49:48.589 --> 01:49:48.599 align:start position:0%
was I'm going to give you a very very
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
brief background and why this is
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
important and its connection certainly
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire so um the Battle of
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
Bunker Hill
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
occurred on June um excuse me the 16th
 
01:50:06.109 --> 01:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
and into the 17th of June in 1775 250
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
years ago coming up uh the battle Bunker
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hill occurred during the BOS the British
 
01:50:13.149 --> 01:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
occupation of the city of Boston on the
 
01:50:15.589 --> 01:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
night of the 16th in 1775 American
 
01:50:17.830 --> 01:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
forces set up a fortification on breeds
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hill so as to be able to um fire cannon
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
into the city of Boston Boston was
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
heavily occupied by British troops but
 
01:50:29.229 --> 01:50:29.239 align:start position:0%
they were blockaded by American forces
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
on the neck Boston used to be a
 
01:50:34.589 --> 01:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
peninsula in in the 1700s it was
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
substantially filled in later so there
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
was a a narrow neck American forces had
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
Boston and they had occupied what was
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
called Dorchester Heights at the time
 
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
which was also smooshed to make the Back
 
01:50:56.030 --> 01:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
Bay and other other parts of the city
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
this fortification on Bunker Hill would
 
01:51:01.229 --> 01:51:01.239 align:start position:0%
have been a big advantage to American
 
01:51:03.830 --> 01:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
forces while
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
constructing this the war once it was
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
discovered warships within Boston Harbor
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
began firing on the hill while they were
 
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
constructing the fort amazingly only one
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
person was killed during the
 
01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
fortification in the morning British
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
forces set foot on Charles toown neck
 
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
which was was also a peninsula at the
 
01:51:35.229 --> 01:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
time and the British Set Fire to the to
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
Charlestown literally Set Fire to the
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
hill soldiers and militia men because we
 
01:51:51.629 --> 01:51:51.639 align:start position:0%
did have a continental army at the time
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
it was very in very early formations um
 
01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
on the Battle of Bunker Hill were from
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Connecticut Rhode Island
 
01:52:00.669 --> 01:52:00.679 align:start position:0%
and New
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire notably from New Hampshire the
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
first and third New Hampshire regiments
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
under the commands of Colonel John Stark
 
01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
and Colonel James Reed Stark would later
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
become the hero of the battle in
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
Bennington and made made a general so
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
much is his importance to our history
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
that he is one of the few that has a
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
statue out front of the State
 
01:52:24.310 --> 01:52:24.320 align:start position:0%
House now the Battle of Bunker
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
Hill was actually the deadliest battle
 
01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
of the Revolutionary War and it occurred
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
right at the
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
beginning 135 Patriots were killed 305
 
01:52:38.589 --> 01:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
were wounded 226 British were killed and
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
825 British were wounded in this
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
battle despite technically being a
 
01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
British victory that came at a massive
 
01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
cost to the British
 
01:52:54.189 --> 01:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
forces so the event showed that an
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
inexperienced American militia could
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
stand up to the British army which at
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
the time was considered the greatest
 
01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
army in the
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
world this was the first allout war of
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
the Revolution we hear of of Lexington
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
had conquered we hear of some of the
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
other things that occurred minor
 
01:53:13.149 --> 01:53:13.159 align:start position:0%
skirmishes but this was full-on
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
signified a major event in the history
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
of our nation and to our state the list
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
of notable people who fought at Bunker
 
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
Hill is an amazing read I won't read it
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
but it's literally the folks that were
 
01:53:34.109 --> 01:53:34.119 align:start position:0%
there formed the beginning of this
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
nation one of whom who was killed was
 
01:53:40.069 --> 01:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
was General Warren Dr Warren Dr Warren
 
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
was so instrumental at the beginning of
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
the Revolutionary War and so popular
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
that it is argued that he may have been
 
01:53:48.189 --> 01:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
our first
 
01:53:52.910 --> 01:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
president and he fell on Bunker Hill
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
so as we move forward in the next decade
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
of anniversaries of events and as we
 
01:54:02.109 --> 01:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
celebrate the Revolutionary War in the
 
01:54:04.910 --> 01:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
beginning of this nation
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
um this this event really from a New
 
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire standpoint stands
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
out and um it was it was the wisdom of
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
Reed and Stark that
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
saw problems in the battle that and made
 
01:54:27.069 --> 01:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
decisions that were substantial in in
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
keeping things um viable in the fight
 
01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
the American forces ultimately lost
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
because we just simply ran out of
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
ammunition so um due to the substantial
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
historical significance of this event
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
due to New Hampshire's big role in this
 
01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
event I thought it would make uh sense
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
under our statute to issue a one-year
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
commemorative plate for the Battle of
 
01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:57.069 align:start position:0%
commemorative plate for the Battle of
Bunker

01:54:57.069 --> 01:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill couldn't
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
let you get away thank you for my
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
question away without one question
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
um Beyond uh beyond the plate um and and
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
the recognition of the um is there any
 
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
purpose to the to the funding uh the
 
01:55:24.270 --> 01:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
additional cost that this would take as
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
you saw in the bill the funding goes
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
towards the
 
01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:29.679 align:start position:0%
Heritage U commission and and they'll do
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
with it as you know as they see fit um
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
this is not being done as as some sort
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
of a revenue producer by any stretch of
 
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
the imagination but um you know bringing
 
01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:40.629 align:start position:0%
the imagination but um you know bringing
awareness

01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
to um you know the the formation of of
 
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
this country bringing awareness to folks
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
that have no idea that we're even
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
entering into this 250th annivers period
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
in our country um is just you know aside
 
01:55:58.149 --> 01:55:58.159 align:start position:0%
from showing a little bit of patriotism
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
and some pride as as to our New
 
01:56:02.109 --> 01:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's involvement you know just
 
01:56:05.709 --> 01:56:05.719 align:start position:0%
making folks aware of you know this is
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
this is the time period in our great
 
01:56:08.270 --> 01:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
nation that we're going to be entering
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
into and and and according to um a lot
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%

01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:22.950 align:start position:0%
coming follow up thank you Mr chairman
um

01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
is Massachusetts issuing a a a plate do
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know Massachusetts
 
01:56:29.030 --> 01:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
issues a lot of different plates for
 
01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
things but I'm I'm not aware of of what
 
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is doing um as far as that
 
01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
goes thank you representative
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you Mr chair um I may have
 
01:56:43.709 --> 01:56:43.719 align:start position:0%
missed this is there a a price of the
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
commemorative plate that you'll that
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
will that the that is handled by the by
 
01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:50.550 align:start position:0%
will that the that is handled by the by
the

01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
DMV under their rules
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
follow follow is there an anticipated
 
01:57:01.069 --> 01:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
sold no idea you know as you're aware
 
01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
right our license plates today are
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
decals right I mean if you've ever seen
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
a delaminated license plate you you're
 
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
acutely aware of what happens you can
 
01:57:16.430 --> 01:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually peel them apart um so as far as
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know the Department of Motor
 
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
Vehicles creating a um
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
some sort of a design for for that it's
 
01:57:26.950 --> 01:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's the application of a decal that it
 
01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
would be just in any of the other moose
 
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
plate or other decals that we put on a
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
license plate so I I this isn't this
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't incur substantial cost the DMV
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
is not even here to they're not clearly
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
not worried about it so um but yeah
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
that's that you know just through the
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
way we make license plates today it's
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
quite easy to to do that and you don't
 
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
you're not in a situation where you say
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
you stamp a thousand plates and we we
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
sell 50 right that those are cre on
 
01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
demand just as our legislative plates
 
01:57:56.830 --> 01:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
are representative
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
Jon yes thank you Mr chair so I'm just
 
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
noticing from the uh from the license
 
01:58:02.830 --> 01:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
plate Bill we saw this morning with a
 
01:58:05.229 --> 01:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of $225,000 and yours
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
projected $10,000 for production are you
 
01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
confident in that $10,000 because the
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
disparity between the two different
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
vanity plates seems dramatic to me I
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
have no idea what it cost to make a
 
01:58:18.589 --> 01:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
vanity plate I do know that New
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire per capita has the largest
 
01:58:22.830 --> 01:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
vanity plate use in the country um we
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
we're very much into our vanity plates
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh which is great every
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
single vehicle I own has a vanity plate
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
so um you know I'm certainly uh I've
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
certainly partake in that Revenue
 
01:58:38.109 --> 01:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
producing Venture from the state um you
 
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
know and uh for seven years when I was
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
in college I lived in the state of
 
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma Oklahoma has
 
01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
150 different license plates they make a
 
01:58:49.149 --> 01:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
ton of money off their vanity plates so
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
this is just another just something a
 
01:58:52.870 --> 01:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more unique than us seeing a
 
01:58:55.189 --> 01:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
moose plate a veterans plate or a
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
National Guard plate say this is It's
 
01:58:58.750 --> 01:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
just adding to that and again it's only
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
for a year it's only for one year so um
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know and it'll fall under under the
 
01:59:06.950 --> 01:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations of of uh
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
commemorative plates that already
 
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
exist representative V thank you Mr
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you taking my question
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
why Bunker Hill and not the semi Quin
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
Centennial when New Hampshire was the
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
first to declare independence from the
 
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
crown U why you picked
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
Bunker Hill
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
over U the 250th anniversary which will
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
be coming up within less than 12 months
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
starting that year sure um I mean
 
01:59:36.430 --> 01:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
realistically between the pine tree
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
riots and the Constitution being signed
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
I we've got thousands of events that
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
that could be potentially put on the
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
reason that Bunker Hill stands out is
 
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
because of it of it again being the
 
01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
first full-on war at act the first
 
01:59:55.030 --> 01:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
full-on actual engagement of a of

Hampshire's unique role in making that

Endeavor

02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
Endeavor
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
and rather than just say have a
 
02:00:22.149 --> 02:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
generic 250th Revolutionary War plate
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
right that this this the reason for
 
02:00:27.069 --> 02:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
highlighting this is just because of it
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's significant involvement
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
on in something that was just so
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
substantial it changed Bunker Hill
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
completely changed the british's the
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
British opinion on the farmers with
 
02:00:43.390 --> 02:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
pitchforks mentality they had against
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
militia um it completely changed the the
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
way that the British
 
02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
operated within their War tactics
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
but it also gave the
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
Americans hope for the first time that
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
holy cow we can
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually we may actually have something
 
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
here so that the significance of Bunker
 
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
Hill I think is is is enough to
 
02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:10.679 align:start position:0%
Warrant it individually and that's why I
 
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I submitted the
 
02:01:14.189 --> 02:01:14.199 align:start position:0%
legislation any other questions from the
 
02:01:16.990 --> 02:01:17.000 align:start position:0%

have that please forward it to us so the

clerk can kind of post it accordingly um
 
03:05:53.389 --> 03:05:53.399 align:start position:0%
during any time that year are testifying
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative Prout welcome to
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you Mr chairman for
 
03:05:59.910 --> 03:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
the record I Andrew Prout representing
 
03:06:02.710 --> 03:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County District 13 the town of
 
03:06:05.229 --> 03:06:05.239 align:start position:0%
Hudson this bill is nearly the same as
 
03:06:07.229 --> 03:06:07.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill 198 that was before this
 
03:06:09.790 --> 03:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
committee last term with changes to
 
03:06:11.710 --> 03:06:11.720 align:start position:0%
address feedback from the DMV received
 
03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
after the bill passed over to the
 
03:06:16.030 --> 03:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
Senate after retained by the senate
 
03:06:17.349 --> 03:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
committee I didn't pursue it further
 
03:06:18.990 --> 03:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
because because given the split in the
 
03:06:20.389 --> 03:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
house membership last term and the
 
03:06:21.790 --> 03:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
rework needed on the bill including
 
03:06:23.790 --> 03:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
adding a fiscal note I was not
 
03:06:26.389 --> 03:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
optimistic about its passage uh the
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
second half of last term went better
 
03:06:29.670 --> 03:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
than I expected so I now somewhat regret
 
03:06:32.670 --> 03:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
that decision but here we are uh a
 
03:06:34.269 --> 03:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
version of this bill was also before the
 
03:06:35.910 --> 03:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
this committee the term before as well
 
03:06:38.670 --> 03:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
as House Bill
 
03:06:42.510 --> 03:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
1643 this bill will amend RSA 26335 the
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
section that requires new residents to
 
03:06:45.309 --> 03:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
transfer their out ofate driver's
 
03:06:47.590 --> 03:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
license to an instate driver's license
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
to add additional reporting requirements
 
03:06:50.950 --> 03:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
of a person's circumstances change
 
03:06:53.229 --> 03:06:53.239 align:start position:0%
within those 60 days and direct the
 
03:06:54.950 --> 03:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
department of safety to send reminder
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
letters to voters who presented out
 
03:06:58.630 --> 03:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
ofate driver's licenses at the polls if
 
03:07:00.309 --> 03:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
they failed to do
 
03:07:02.590 --> 03:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
so the changes from last term are to
 
03:07:04.070 --> 03:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
make an appropriation to the department
 
03:07:06.150 --> 03:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
for it changes necessary for
 
03:07:08.469 --> 03:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
implementation and a more clearly spell
 
03:07:11.469 --> 03:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
out an implementation
 
03:07:13.830 --> 03:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
timeline this bill is a follow-up to the
 
03:07:16.030 --> 03:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
letter sent to then speaker Jasper on
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
September 6th 2017 by by the Secretary
 
03:07:19.830 --> 03:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
of State and commissioner safety
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
reporting on the 2016 general election
 
03:07:26.030 --> 03:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
in this letter A dismal
 
03:07:28.630 --> 03:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
84.5% unexplained non-compliance rate
 
03:07:30.150 --> 03:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the driver's license transfer
 
03:07:31.750 --> 03:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
requirement was
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
reported I've worked with the secretary
 
03:07:36.030 --> 03:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
of state and DMV director morasco and I
 
03:07:37.349 --> 03:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
believe we have sufficiently addressed
 
03:07:39.229 --> 03:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
the implementation concerns with this
 
03:07:41.469 --> 03:07:41.479 align:start position:0%
bill I'd also like to stress that this
 
03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
bill may just be a first step I
 
03:07:45.070 --> 03:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
certainly plan to watch the statistics
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
for how many letters are sent and the
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
response rate I've warned director of
 
03:07:50.229 --> 03:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
morasco that I'll be asking for those
 
03:07:51.750 --> 03:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
numbers periodically once this gets
 
03:07:54.190 --> 03:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
going but I feel that more intensive and
 
03:07:56.469 --> 03:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
therefore more expensive measures can't
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
be justified without that data in hand I
 
03:08:00.830 --> 03:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
submit a written testimony to the
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
committee that describes the bill in
 
03:08:04.349 --> 03:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
more depth so I'll stop here and I'd be
 
03:08:05.670 --> 03:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions the
 
03:08:06.950 --> 03:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee may
 
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
have thank you so much any questions
 
03:08:12.429 --> 03:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:15.670 --> 03:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
committee I actually have one um in your
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
bill over in line
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh six where it says um or actually goes
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
into seven where it says
 
03:08:27.790 --> 03:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
um shall have a maximum of 60 days from
 
03:08:31.190 --> 03:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
the date of his or her residency was
 
03:08:33.790 --> 03:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
established how does someone establish
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
their residency what do they need in
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
order to consider to be
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
established um so that part is existing
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
law and the when someone's moving into
 
03:08:46.269 --> 03:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
the state you know there is I guess
 
03:08:48.030 --> 03:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
theoretically as according to law a
 
03:08:49.710 --> 03:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
magic moment at which they are now a New
 
03:08:51.550 --> 03:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident I feel like in
 
03:08:54.429 --> 03:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
practice that's a little bit more fuzzy
 
03:08:56.349 --> 03:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
and it has a lot to do with the person's
 
03:08:59.110 --> 03:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
intent and their state of mind um and
 
03:09:00.750 --> 03:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's very and that I think is part been
 
03:09:03.229 --> 03:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
part of the problems in this space of
 
03:09:04.510 --> 03:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
the residency requirements and
 
03:09:06.469 --> 03:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
everything else is that trying to
 
03:09:08.510 --> 03:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
objectively determine that exact moment
 
03:09:11.190 --> 03:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
in time is not an easy task there's
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
certainly are certain events which we
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
expect you will have already passed that
 
03:09:18.750 --> 03:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
threshold before you do voting is one of
 
03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
them um there in the Supreme Court
 
03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
opinion referenced in my uh written
 
03:09:25.950 --> 03:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
testimony they go through a ly of other
 
03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
events which that could also trigger
 
03:09:30.269 --> 03:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
that um enrolling a child in school
 
03:09:31.870 --> 03:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
getting a dumb permit other things that
 
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
are evidence that you have that has
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
already happened but in terms of uh
 
03:09:38.349 --> 03:09:38.359 align:start position:0%
attempting to Define exactly when that
 
03:09:40.830 --> 03:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
moment is for any given individual I'm
 
03:09:42.510 --> 03:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
not sure there's an easy objective way
 
03:09:44.229 --> 03:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:09:46.229 --> 03:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
that any other questions from the
 
03:09:46.239 --> 03:09:47.910 align:start position:0%

committee

elections law committee um I don't often
 
03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
get a chance to get out and meet the
 
03:10:17.950 --> 03:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
other committee committees so it's a
 
03:10:19.710 --> 03:10:19.720 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here today to talk about
 
03:10:22.229 --> 03:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:10:25.630 --> 03:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
um it is not unusual when a voter
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
registers to vote for an out ofate
 
03:10:31.469 --> 03:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
driver's license to be used to establish
 
03:10:33.870 --> 03:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
identity uh in that
 
03:10:37.870 --> 03:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
process um when that happens a notation
 
03:10:41.630 --> 03:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
is made on the voter checklist uh and in
 
03:10:44.349 --> 03:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
the the registration records that the
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
voter used that type of identification
 
03:10:50.710 --> 03:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
process the law says that when a person
 
03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
establishes residency in the state of
 
03:11:01.990 --> 03:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they have X number of days
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
to obtain a New Hampshire driver's
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
license if they're going to drive a
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:14.670 --> 03:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
state when a voter uses an outof state
 
03:11:18.469 --> 03:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
driver's license they are saying
 
03:11:20.030 --> 03:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
that they have
 
03:11:22.950 --> 03:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
established their residency in the state
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire because you have to be
 
03:11:27.630 --> 03:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
a resident uh to be able to vote in the
 
03:11:29.910 --> 03:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
state the common word in the election
 
03:11:32.510 --> 03:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
statute is domicile but the court has
 
03:11:36.030 --> 03:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
said that it is effectively the same
 
03:11:39.790 --> 03:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
thing there is no mechanism currently
 
03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
for the Secretary of State to follow up
 
03:11:46.229 --> 03:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
on those voters that used an outof state
 
03:11:49.269 --> 03:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
license uh to register to vote to see if
 
03:11:52.030 --> 03:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
they have in fact followed through with
 
03:11:55.389 --> 03:11:55.399 align:start position:0%
the laws that residents are subject to
 
03:11:57.830 --> 03:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
because the law is the law of a
 
03:11:59.950 --> 03:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
different state agency in this case
 
03:12:02.429 --> 03:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles it could be a fish and
 
03:12:04.870 --> 03:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
game law if you know if that same voter
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
wants to you know get a fishing game
 
03:12:09.790 --> 03:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
license or things like
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
that and so for that reason um I'm
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
supportive of the language in this bill
 
03:12:19.150 --> 03:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
that would allow us to match the
 
03:12:20.950 --> 03:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
information further than we currently
 
03:12:23.630 --> 03:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
are obligated to match by federal and
 
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
state statute to determine the status of
 
03:12:29.349 --> 03:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
those voters that used an out ofst state
 
03:12:31.309 --> 03:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license for the voter
 
03:12:34.110 --> 03:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
registration process and did they follow
 
03:12:34.120 --> 03:12:35.870 align:start position:0%
registration process and did they follow
up

03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:12:38.190 --> 03:12:38.200 align:start position:0%
um W with the laws of the State of New
 
03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to actually obtain their
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
instate uh driver's
 
03:12:45.070 --> 03:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
license and that's why I support the
 
03:12:46.830 --> 03:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
bill so based on that I'd be happy to
 
03:12:49.389 --> 03:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
answer any questions uh if there are
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
any thank you so much any questions from
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Hill thank
 
03:12:57.510 --> 03:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and uh welcome uh to

you Mr chairman and uh welcome uh to
house

03:12:58.349 --> 03:12:58.359 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:13:02.550 --> 03:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
Transportation um as I recall um when a
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
when a voter from my days in election
 
03:13:10.150 --> 03:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
law um when a voter um is indicated it
 
03:13:13.590 --> 03:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
comes to the table uh to CHS his license
 
03:13:17.670 --> 03:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
and it's a Minnesota license um
 
03:13:21.790 --> 03:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
the clerk is supposed to write MN next
 
03:13:27.790 --> 03:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
to their name in red pencil I guess um I
 
03:13:31.229 --> 03:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
recall seeing numbers of those uh as I
 
03:13:36.150 --> 03:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
reviewed after an election um does
 
03:13:40.510 --> 03:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
anyone follow up um currently to find
 
03:13:44.150 --> 03:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
out if that person is using that same MN
 
03:13:51.710 --> 03:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:53.229 --> 03:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
I'm TR the best way to answer that
 
03:13:56.670 --> 03:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
question if if they come in and use that
 
03:14:00.229 --> 03:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
same license as their proof of
 
03:14:02.590 --> 03:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
identity uh when they go to obtain their
 
03:14:05.349 --> 03:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
license not registering but obtain their
 
03:14:08.429 --> 03:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
license um I believe a notation is
 
03:14:10.790 --> 03:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to be made on that but I don't
 
03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
know that the the database is picking up
 
03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
on you know has that voter obtained
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire driver's license yet
 
03:14:23.150 --> 03:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
um I I think this bill will help do that
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
um it's an area that really should be
 
03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
focused on and um you know for the
 
03:14:30.590 --> 03:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee when a person
 
03:14:33.070 --> 03:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
registers to vote they have to prove
 
03:14:33.080 --> 03:14:33.910 align:start position:0%
registers to vote they have to prove
four

03:14:33.910 --> 03:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:14:37.389 --> 03:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
things identity number one age they're
 
03:14:40.590 --> 03:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
old enough citizenship are they United
 
03:14:40.600 --> 03:14:41.790 align:start position:0%
old enough citizenship are they United
States

03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
States
 
03:14:44.950 --> 03:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
citizen and then domicile are they a
 
03:14:47.870 --> 03:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
resident uh of the state
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
up until just a few years ago a voter
 
03:14:54.269 --> 03:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
could walk into the polling place
 
03:14:57.910 --> 03:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
without any documentation of those items
 
03:15:00.309 --> 03:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
and prove their qualifications simply by
 
03:15:03.030 --> 03:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
filling out
 
03:15:05.349 --> 03:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
affidavits uh the most recent law that
 
03:15:07.790 --> 03:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
has passed related to that now requires
 
03:15:10.550 --> 03:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
that when a voter shows up they actually
 
03:15:13.070 --> 03:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
have to show the documentation of all
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
four of those items although identity
 
03:15:19.670 --> 03:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
can still be a governmental uh ID from
 
03:15:22.349 --> 03:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
state this bill will help make sure that
 
03:15:27.790 --> 03:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
those individuals that use that type of
 
03:15:29.750 --> 03:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
documentation have actually gone to the
 
03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
next step and follow the law that
 
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
residents are required to follow by
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%

03:16:30.830 --> 03:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes um if there is I don't
 
03:16:33.469 --> 03:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
suspect that it would be much there is
 
03:16:34.870 --> 03:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
already a
 
03:16:37.349 --> 03:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
requirement uh through federal statute
 
03:16:41.189 --> 03:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
that we have to match uh uh just match
 
03:16:42.670 --> 03:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
data from the voter registration
 
03:16:45.269 --> 03:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
database with motor vehicle records
 
03:16:47.750 --> 03:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
looking for um
 
03:16:51.070 --> 03:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
anomalies uh such as U you know same
 
03:16:52.950 --> 03:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
name same birthday but maybe different
 
03:16:54.870 --> 03:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
addresses so that we can get that
 
03:16:58.750 --> 03:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
cleaned up um I there may be some
 
03:17:02.309 --> 03:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
additional software cause costs involved
 
03:17:02.319 --> 03:17:04.389 align:start position:0%
additional software cause costs involved
with

03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:17:07.950 --> 03:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
um you know going the step with uh you
 
03:17:09.550 --> 03:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
know making sure that outof state
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
licenses are you know have been changed

03:17:30.349 --> 03:17:30.359 align:start position:0%

03:17:50.110 --> 03:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon everyone I am Aaron Hennessy I
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
am the deputy secretary of state and
 
03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
part of my job is to do the fiscal notes
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
for all of the hundreds not quite
 
03:17:58.910 --> 03:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
hundreds this year but many fiscal notes
 
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we get to our department for this
 
03:18:03.309 --> 03:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
one it simply requires our department to
 
03:18:06.790 --> 03:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
share the data for anyone who has used a
 
03:18:08.750 --> 03:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
out of state driver's license to either
 
03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
I believe it's to register or to vote
 
03:18:12.030 --> 03:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
but it might just be to vote have to
 
03:18:15.269 --> 03:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
look into exact exact language um and we
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
already have this information in our
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
database so that would be an easy data
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
share with the Department of Motor
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%

representative Prout for um reaching out
 
03:20:27.990 --> 03:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
in advance and we've had some uh lengthy
 
03:20:30.269 --> 03:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
conversations about his bill and uh he's
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
educated me quite a bit on Election law
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
and um how it would fit into what he's
 
03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do here with this bill I want
 
03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
to thank you for that sir it was uh
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
those were great conversations and um so
 
03:20:44.670 --> 03:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
in reading the bill uh ultimately to to
 
03:20:47.229 --> 03:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
representative Hill's question
 
03:20:48.910 --> 03:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
um we we do have that communication with
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State there there is
 
03:20:52.590 --> 03:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
information that goes from the DMV there
 
03:20:54.830 --> 03:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh to update records uh with Secretary
 
03:20:57.030 --> 03:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
of State's office um so this bill would
 
03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
require uh the opposite it would require
 
03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
that um based on my understanding when
 
03:21:03.990 --> 03:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
somebody votes and they use an outof
 
03:21:06.110 --> 03:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
state license if they have residency in
 
03:21:07.469 --> 03:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but they're using that out
 
03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
ofate license um this bill would after
 
03:21:13.750 --> 03:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
the uh 60 days has passed um with an
 
03:21:16.830 --> 03:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
additional 30 of a buffer so in total 9
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
days um there would have to be a
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
notification from Secretary of State's
 
03:21:23.469 --> 03:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
office through a batch file to the DMV
 
03:21:25.710 --> 03:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
which would then come in um and at that
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
point what we could do is uh configure
 
03:21:30.429 --> 03:21:30.439 align:start position:0%
the system to monitor uh those names
 
03:21:33.309 --> 03:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
that are entered uh up against does that
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
person um get a New Hampshire driver's
 
03:21:37.469 --> 03:21:37.479 align:start position:0%
license um you know I'm going to leave
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
it to the it experts on how we're going
 
03:21:41.309 --> 03:21:41.319 align:start position:0%
to deconflict that information um but
 
03:21:42.830 --> 03:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's something that uh that we can
 
03:21:45.630 --> 03:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
work through um so our role would be
 
03:21:47.469 --> 03:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
deconflict figure out how many have
 
03:21:48.790 --> 03:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
actually got the New Hampshire license
 
03:21:51.110 --> 03:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
how many have not those that have not uh
 
03:21:52.429 --> 03:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
based on the bill would get a notice
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
from the DMV advising them that they
 
03:21:57.510 --> 03:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
haven't fulfilled the requirement of
 
03:21:59.550 --> 03:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
obtaining a New Hampshire license after
 
03:22:02.429 --> 03:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
voting uh with a not estate license and
 
03:22:04.110 --> 03:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
then there's a responsibility on the
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
DMV's part to track that information and
 
03:22:08.510 --> 03:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
to take in those responses however they
 
03:22:10.189 --> 03:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
might come in which I think is something
 
03:22:11.870 --> 03:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
that we're still going to work through
 
03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
which would be is this something where
 
03:22:14.830 --> 03:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
we're taking in emails and there is a
 
03:22:17.229 --> 03:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for a full-time position to
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
manage this program uh my understanding
 
03:22:21.349 --> 03:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
from speaking with representative proud
 
03:22:23.950 --> 03:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
is that you could have a couple thousand
 
03:22:26.429 --> 03:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
several thousand uh after an election
 
03:22:27.790 --> 03:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
that might have to be vetted out this
 
03:22:29.550 --> 03:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
way uh so you would need somebody that's
 
03:22:30.429 --> 03:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
going to be able to take that
 
03:22:33.990 --> 03:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
information in and review it and um and
 
03:22:36.990 --> 03:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
identify whether or not um there's any
 
03:22:38.349 --> 03:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
further action and that was a question I
 
03:22:39.710 --> 03:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
had for the representative what action
 
03:22:41.429 --> 03:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
is there if they don't respond to the
 
03:22:43.870 --> 03:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
DMV and uh my understanding is at this
 
03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
point there is none um it's more for for
 
03:22:51.630 --> 03:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
um analysis data Gathering research um
 
03:22:53.710 --> 03:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
and could set the stage for a phase 2
 
03:22:56.110 --> 03:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
Bill uh or an add-on to this bill that
 
03:22:58.110 --> 03:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
that could um have a little bit more
 
03:23:00.229 --> 03:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement behind it but as far as
 
03:23:03.510 --> 03:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
making the bill work um based on uh
 
03:23:05.950 --> 03:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
what's here I think we could fulfill it
 
03:23:08.150 --> 03:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh with what's in the fiscal note for
 
03:23:10.830 --> 03:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
somebody that could manage it
 
03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to take any
 
03:23:15.309 --> 03:23:15.319 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the
 
03:23:17.950 --> 03:23:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee or representative Hill thank
 
03:23:21.790 --> 03:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you director um if
 
03:23:24.830 --> 03:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
someone came in um
 
03:23:28.269 --> 03:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
after uh that that notice was sent to
 
03:23:31.309 --> 03:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
them um but six months eight months
 
03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
later um I don't think the bill speaks
 
03:23:38.110 --> 03:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
to any penalty or any um punitive
 
03:23:41.349 --> 03:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
damages for for doing it not within a
 
03:23:43.750 --> 03:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
timely fashion is that is that what
 
03:23:46.510 --> 03:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
currently someone could come in 5 years
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
years later um now correctly that's my
 
03:23:52.309 --> 03:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
understanding so I mean there's a grace
 
03:23:54.510 --> 03:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
period That's cited in the bill um you
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
know if somebody goes beyond the 90 days
 
03:23:58.510 --> 03:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
there's still the director's discretion
 
03:24:00.950 --> 03:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
on um a grace period if you're working
 
03:24:02.189 --> 03:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
through a situation where you might get
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
a response from someone um but again if
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
they don't respond uh there's nothing in
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
the bill that requires additional
 
03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
followup or there could be a sanction of
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
any sort uh the other thing we did talk
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
about uh the representative I and I was
 
03:24:19.030 --> 03:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
um it's Tethered to the license and
 
03:24:20.670 --> 03:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
although somebody voted with a not
 
03:24:23.150 --> 03:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
estate license um there is the
 
03:24:25.110 --> 03:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
possibility that uh they are a New
 
03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident but they don't come
 
03:24:27.429 --> 03:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
in to get a New Hampshire license
 
03:24:28.950 --> 03:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
because they don't need one they don't
 
03:24:31.710 --> 03:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
want one um so you would have a notice
 
03:24:33.269 --> 03:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
that then goes out to an individual
 
03:24:35.590 --> 03:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
saying you voted you use an out ofate
 
03:24:37.510 --> 03:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
license you haven't you know obtained a
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire license why and um so we
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
talked about could that be beyond the
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
scope of the DMV is that a letter that
 
03:24:45.670 --> 03:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
we should be sending I mean we're
 
03:24:48.189 --> 03:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
reactive you know driving is a privilege
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
getting a license is a privilege people
 
03:24:51.710 --> 03:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
come to us if they want that privilege
 
03:24:53.189 --> 03:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
and go through the testing to get the
 
03:24:55.750 --> 03:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
license um voting is something totally
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
separate than what we do um so somebody
 
03:25:00.110 --> 03:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
goes to vote in this vein but then
 
03:25:01.469 --> 03:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
they're getting a letter from the DMV
 
03:25:03.189 --> 03:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
over here saying hey we've been keeping
 
03:25:04.630 --> 03:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
an eye on this and we noticed that you
 
03:25:06.189 --> 03:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
haven't got a New Hampshire license but
 
03:25:08.670 --> 03:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
you voted over here with a Mass license
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
um we did talk about if that goes beyond
 
03:25:12.070 --> 03:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
the scope of what the DMV should be
 
03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
doing um because I don't I don't know
 
03:25:15.710 --> 03:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe that person got a non-driver
 
03:25:19.469 --> 03:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
ID uh maybe that person um was a
 
03:25:20.790 --> 03:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
resident here in New Hampshire and to
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
your point representative Hill went
 
03:25:24.670 --> 03:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
beyond the 90 days uh was a resident at
 
03:25:25.870 --> 03:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
the time they voted and then moved back
 
03:25:27.590 --> 03:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts but now they're getting
 
03:25:29.389 --> 03:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
a letter from our office saying you
 
03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
haven't got your New Hampshire license
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
and their response may be well first of
 
03:25:35.030 --> 03:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
all how do you know and secondly why you
 
03:25:36.389 --> 03:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
sending me this letter because I know I
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
don't have one I don't want one um so
 
03:25:41.349 --> 03:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
that was the one piece we talked about
 
03:25:43.550 --> 03:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
in those select cases that could be an
 
03:25:47.189 --> 03:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
overreach Paul thank you Mr chairman um
 
03:25:49.550 --> 03:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
I recall from my days in election law
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
that um when when I should have probably
 
03:25:55.870 --> 03:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
asked uh secretary about it but there
 
03:25:58.269 --> 03:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
there were a number of people that used
 
03:26:03.189 --> 03:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
outof state licenses for years um and
 
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if um this letter goes
 
03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
out and then the second year this person
 
03:26:12.590 --> 03:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
pops back up on on your your list maybe
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's when um someone needs to step in
 
03:26:18.830 --> 03:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
and take other action whether it's the
 
03:26:20.990 --> 03:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
secretary or whether it's the director I
 
03:26:24.349 --> 03:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
don't know but um maybe maybe that was
 
03:26:26.469 --> 03:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
the way to look at it I don't know yeah
 
03:26:28.510 --> 03:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
more it's a good point not a question
 
03:26:31.670 --> 03:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
more a statement yeah any other
 
03:26:33.229 --> 03:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
03:26:35.630 --> 03:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you sir
 
03:26:37.469 --> 03:26:37.479 align:start position:0%

Transportation committee I'm normally an
 
03:26:57.189 --> 03:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
election law so um my name is Olivia

zinc I'm a voter in Franklin um and um o
 
03:27:02.469 --> 03:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
represent open democracy we're a
 
03:27:05.030 --> 03:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit um representing
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
36,000 voters um across the state I want
 
03:27:12.750 --> 03:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
to start with a story um I this year I I
 
03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
work at the elections uh as I'm also a
 
03:27:16.189 --> 03:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
city councelor so that makes me a
 
03:27:19.870 --> 03:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and so um they asked the PE
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
body place came in with a van from the
 
03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
nursing home of some voters and they
 
03:27:25.510 --> 03:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
asked for some help wheeling in some
 
03:27:28.189 --> 03:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
voters so I had the honor and privilege
 
03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
of wheeling in a voter who used a main
 
03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
driver's license to vote who is in a
 
03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
nursing home in Franklin already
 
03:27:38.910 --> 03:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
registered on the checklist with 24p
 
03:27:40.349 --> 03:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
body place which is the address of the
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
nursing home but used a main driver's
 
03:27:46.189 --> 03:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
license the voting law says if you're
 
03:27:48.469 --> 03:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
over 65 and you have an expired driver's
 
03:27:51.030 --> 03:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
license you can still continue to use an
 
03:27:54.150 --> 03:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
expired driver's license um and so what
 
03:27:55.990 --> 03:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
my question for you is with this bill
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
will we
 
03:28:00.070 --> 03:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
require residents of nursing home to
 
03:28:01.630 --> 03:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
then get a New Hampshire driver's
 
03:28:04.590 --> 03:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
license in order to continue to vote um
 
03:28:07.389 --> 03:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
where they are now residing and and just
 
03:28:10.389 --> 03:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
to remind you that you can be domiciled
 
03:28:12.510 --> 03:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
you know your identity when voting is
 
03:28:14.910 --> 03:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
just to prove this picture is
 
03:28:17.710 --> 03:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
me the the folks are checking to make
 
03:28:20.550 --> 03:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
sure the names are the same and domicile
 
03:28:23.070 --> 03:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
is proved through other
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
mechanisms um I also want I have a
 
03:28:27.790 --> 03:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
neighbor down the street from me that
 
03:28:29.550 --> 03:28:29.560 align:start position:0%
that has recently moved in I see them
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
drive by with Connecticut plates I still
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
know they live in my neighborhood um but
 
03:28:35.429 --> 03:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
have they sold their house in
 
03:28:37.910 --> 03:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
Connecticut when when are they
 
03:28:40.110 --> 03:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
officially um I think that the question
 
03:28:41.790 --> 03:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
was asked by the chair earlier of when
 
03:28:44.590 --> 03:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
does that residency requirement happen
 
03:28:45.710 --> 03:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
but if they bought a house and they
 
03:28:45.720 --> 03:28:46.710 align:start position:0%
but if they bought a house and they
voted

03:28:46.710 --> 03:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
voted
 
03:28:48.309 --> 03:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
and they're they're living on my street
 
03:28:49.710 --> 03:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
but still driving their Connecticut
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
plates I I think there is a point where
 
03:28:54.110 --> 03:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
you do have to change your driver's
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
license so those individuals do need
 
03:28:57.790 --> 03:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
those letters but I think there are
 
03:29:00.790 --> 03:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
other voters blind voters voters with
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
disabilities uh voters that might not
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
have a a non-driver's identity um who
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
are using um other forms of physical IDE
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
identification I do want to speak to
 
03:29:14.990 --> 03:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
military voters because military voters
 
03:29:17.429 --> 03:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
do have exemptions if they're placed in
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
different places they do not have to to
 
03:29:22.030 --> 03:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
get a new driver's license every time
 
03:29:24.630 --> 03:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
they're stationed and so they may be
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
people that are here on temporary
 
03:29:30.309 --> 03:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
assignment through a military um and and
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
vote here because they're they're
 
03:29:35.429 --> 03:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
domiciled here for for that year um but
 
03:29:36.950 --> 03:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
are voting with an out of state driver's
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
license so I do think we need to take
 
03:29:42.070 --> 03:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
into consideration all of these concerns
 
03:29:46.150 --> 03:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
um and um I urge you to think about uh
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
those voters uh who may be elderly or
 
03:29:51.150 --> 03:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
disabled or have non- drivers
 
03:29:53.070 --> 03:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
identification um because they still
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
have the constitutional right to vote if
 
03:29:58.429 --> 03:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
they're eligible voters um uh so I urge
 
03:30:01.189 --> 03:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
you to itl this this bill um and
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
consider equal access to the ballot for
 
03:30:05.229 --> 03:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
those um New Hampshire citizens and
 
03:30:07.510 --> 03:30:07.520 align:start position:0%

for that have you one of the things that
 
03:38:08.269 --> 03:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
caught my attention and just because of
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
uh some of my other volunteer activities
 
03:38:15.670 --> 03:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
is that in a um genuine nuclear power
 
03:38:18.070 --> 03:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
plant incident
 
03:38:22.910 --> 03:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
um there'd be a huge need for evacuation
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
correct and then those people have to go
 
03:38:29.630 --> 03:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
someplace and um I know I spent several
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
years working on Vermont's
 
03:38:35.870 --> 03:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh nuclear power plant evacuation back
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
when they had uh the one in Vernon uh
 
03:38:41.590 --> 03:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
and a big consideration
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
was uh Sheltering for the people who had
 
03:38:47.790 --> 03:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
to evacuate and so the American Red
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
Cross was particularly involved in
 
03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
providing Sheltering for uh those folks
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
and I wondered if that would be
 
03:38:59.429 --> 03:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
something that had has does the would
 
03:39:02.269 --> 03:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
would they be a a would that be a good
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
addition to your
 
03:39:05.710 --> 03:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
membership I believe
 
03:39:07.950 --> 03:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm not gonna I'm not not going to
 
03:39:11.429 --> 03:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
say no to that that's a yeah I just my
 
03:39:13.590 --> 03:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
experience says that people going to
 
03:39:17.189 --> 03:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
have to go someplace and so one and and
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah generally shelters are operated by
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
many nonprofits but the primary
 
03:39:26.429 --> 03:39:26.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofit operator of Sheltering in the
 
03:39:29.309 --> 03:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
country is the American Red Cross so I
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
just throw that out as a thank you yes
 
03:39:34.469 --> 03:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
sir um if you'd be amenable to that I
 
03:39:38.910 --> 03:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
might no no no objections okay thank you
 
03:39:41.389 --> 03:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
represented Hill thank you Mr chairman
 
03:39:43.030 --> 03:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my
 
03:39:45.710 --> 03:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
question um I'm not a huge F of
 
03:39:48.750 --> 03:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
commissions anyway I've never seen one
 
03:39:53.229 --> 03:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
that did anything any good um but I um
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
kind of surprised that there isn't such
 
03:40:00.189 --> 03:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
a thing already or or perhaps as I'm
 
03:40:04.389 --> 03:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
reading this um maybe there already is
 
03:40:06.389 --> 03:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
this organization because it appears
 
03:40:08.429 --> 03:40:08.439 align:start position:0%
like they're determining the Readiness
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
of the plan so someone must have created
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
the plan at some point this is just to
 
03:40:17.950 --> 03:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
reexamine the plan is that how I
 
03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
03:40:20.960 --> 03:40:22.790 align:start position:0%
understand this
so

03:40:22.790 --> 03:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
um sorry no it's okay
 
03:40:26.160 --> 03:40:29.630 align:start position:0%
um sorry no it's okay
um

03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%

Allenstown merat County District 11 I am
 
04:03:53.389 --> 04:03:53.399 align:start position:0%
pretty much beginning my second
 
04:03:56.910 --> 04:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
non-concurrent term and starting my
 
04:03:58.950 --> 04:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
second term here on the transportation
 
04:04:00.510 --> 04:04:00.520 align:start position:0%

04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
that we've done and that we're
 
04:04:08.189 --> 04:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
doing and um my bill HB 259 the impetus
 
04:04:11.630 --> 04:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
for it was my father who is handicapped
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
and his story is kind of interesting
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
interesting he ran into a situation
 
04:04:18.159 --> 04:04:19.830 align:start position:0%
interesting he ran into a situation
where

04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a limit to the combination of
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
the number of handicap plates and
 
04:04:28.590 --> 04:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
handicap placards that an individual
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
household can get so in his particular
 
04:04:34.670 --> 04:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
case at the time he could only get one
 
04:04:37.269 --> 04:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
plate and one placard and what he chose
 
04:04:39.510 --> 04:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
to do was get the handicap plate for his
 
04:04:42.349 --> 04:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
motorcycle and use the placard for his
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
daily driver
 
04:04:47.590 --> 04:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
and very soon after that he was required
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
to go on a business trip for work and he
 
04:04:52.950 --> 04:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
realized that he didn't want to bring
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
his motorcycle to the parking lot at the
 
04:04:57.950 --> 04:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
airport and had he brought his daily
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
driver his uh four-wheel vehicle to the
 
04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
airport uh he wouldn't be able to park
 
04:05:05.149 --> 04:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
in the handicap section of the airport
 
04:05:07.950 --> 04:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
he'd have to park further away the
 
04:05:10.030 --> 04:05:10.040 align:start position:0%
reason being is that with his placard he
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
would have to bring the placard with him
 
04:05:13.710 --> 04:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
to where he was going on the business
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
trip so for the rental he could park in
 
04:05:18.750 --> 04:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
a handicap spot so that's just basically
 
04:05:21.309 --> 04:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit of the background here and
 
04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
what my bill does is it completely
 
04:05:28.149 --> 04:05:28.159 align:start position:0%
eliminates the limit to the number of
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
handicap plates an individual can get
 
04:05:34.030 --> 04:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
already with this bill being filed there
 
04:05:36.510 --> 04:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
has been some feedback I've received and
 
04:05:38.910 --> 04:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
concerns concerning the
 
04:05:41.110 --> 04:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
um uh number of placards that an
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
individual can get largely those
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
concerned are centered around um abuse
 
04:05:49.870 --> 04:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
of the placard system and so forth um
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
but despite the the the the summary on
 
04:05:56.429 --> 04:05:56.439 align:start position:0%
the bill where it mentions both plates
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
and placards if you look at the language
 
04:06:00.630 --> 04:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill the language of the bill and
 
04:06:03.309 --> 04:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
the section that IT addresses only
 
04:06:04.630 --> 04:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
addresses the
 
04:06:07.710 --> 04:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
plates and that is the intent that I
 
04:06:09.389 --> 04:06:09.399 align:start position:0%
wanted when I filed the
 
04:06:13.030 --> 04:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill purely philosophically speaking if
 
04:06:16.030 --> 04:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
an individ ual is handicapped but they
 
04:06:19.269 --> 04:06:19.279 align:start position:0%
nonetheless are a let's say successful
 
04:06:21.630 --> 04:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
individual let's say said individual has
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
a fleet of 20 vehicles that they like
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
they register them all why not have all
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
the vehicles be equipped with a handicap
 
04:06:35.429 --> 04:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
plate I I feel that the handicap
 
04:06:38.110 --> 04:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
designation should be designated to the
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
individual not to the household or the
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
number of cars that they have or
 
04:06:48.149 --> 04:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
anything like that it to me if if
 
04:06:50.830 --> 04:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
somebody's handicapped they should uh be
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
able to designate each of their vehicles
 
04:06:56.189 --> 04:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
if they register with a handicap
 
04:07:00.309 --> 04:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
plate so I feel that this is fairly
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward and um I'm interested to
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
hear more feedback on this as it as it
 
04:07:08.630 --> 04:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
goes through the process and I welcome
 
04:07:08.640 --> 04:07:10.389 align:start position:0%
goes through the process and I welcome
anybody's

04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
anybody's
 
04:07:12.590 --> 04:07:12.600 align:start position:0%

something like that um do you do you
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
think that there's any room in your bill

for expansion so that it would be more
 
04:07:54.349 --> 04:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
helpful to those
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
caregiving thank you representative uh
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%

sure that we have her handicap placard
 
04:08:33.790 --> 04:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
and you know it's a little bit more
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
convenient for me to use it and help her
 
04:08:38.590 --> 04:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
and get the wheelchair from the casino
 
04:08:40.830 --> 04:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
drop her off and all all the things that
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
come along with being a one day
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
caregiver for somebody with mobility
 
04:08:48.030 --> 04:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
issues a walking walking
 
04:08:48.040 --> 04:08:50.070 align:start position:0%
issues a walking walking
disability

04:08:50.070 --> 04:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
disability
 
04:08:53.710 --> 04:08:53.720 align:start position:0%
um to answer your question directly I'm
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
learning as since I filed this and from
 
04:08:59.030 --> 04:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
some of the Outreach I've gotten from
 
04:09:01.590 --> 04:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
some of the different organizations that
 
04:09:03.630 --> 04:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
there are so many facets and so many
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
angles to um disability law and there's
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
all sorts of work to be done I do not
 
04:09:13.469 --> 04:09:13.479 align:start position:0%
think that addressing the complexities
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
of what may or may not be going on in
 
04:09:16.590 --> 04:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
terms of the
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
placards would be
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate as an amendment let's say to
 
04:09:23.189 --> 04:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
this bill I think
 
04:09:26.710 --> 04:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
that the wide spectrum of disability
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
laws that we have we can attack more on
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
an individual basis some of these issues
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
and and keep keep the walls up with with
 
04:09:39.670 --> 04:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
areas representative kaon
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
representative so am I correct in my
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the current law that
 
04:09:51.710 --> 04:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
it is I've heard one license plate per
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
person I've heard one per household am I
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
correct in the understanding that if uh
 
04:09:58.429 --> 04:09:58.439 align:start position:0%
if two disabled persons occupy the same
 
04:10:00.630 --> 04:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
household that one could get denied a
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
plate if the other one has a licensed
 
04:10:04.590 --> 04:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
plate due to domicile is that
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question
 
04:10:10.229 --> 04:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
representative gas um to my knowledge
 
04:10:12.590 --> 04:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question and your
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct uh in fact I've
 
04:10:18.870 --> 04:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh spoken to a uh couple of Advocates
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
who are in said situation and they did
 
04:10:25.109 --> 04:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
run into that very roadblock when both
 
04:10:28.149 --> 04:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
um the the spouses uh sitting behind me
 
04:10:30.870 --> 04:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
right here in fact um they both have uh
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
a walking disability and they did run
 
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
into some headwinds when they each
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to get a handicap plate for each
 
04:10:41.630 --> 04:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
of their cars um again I want to defer
 
04:10:43.469 --> 04:10:43.479 align:start position:0%
to what I mentioned earlier about the
 
04:10:46.950 --> 04:10:46.960 align:start position:0%
philosophical aspect of this why not why
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
can't an handicapped individual have a
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
handicap plate for every one of their
 
04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
cars um thank
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%

talked to her earlier and I don't know
 
04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
if you are for or against the bill
 
04:11:22.109 --> 04:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
because you said you're kind of going
 
04:11:23.830 --> 04:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
back and forth based on new information
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you chair and
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for allowing me
 
04:11:38.710 --> 04:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
to speak today in opposition of the bill
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I speak uh I just learned that um
 
04:11:46.030 --> 04:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is supposed to be about plates and
 
04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
not placards yet it's it's listed here
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
on on the bill as plates and placards so
 
04:11:56.910 --> 04:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to speak to that fact um I I
 
04:11:59.710 --> 04:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
am uh The Advocate coordinator for
 
04:12:02.830 --> 04:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
United spinal here in New Hampshire but
 
04:12:07.229 --> 04:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
I also uh work under Federal we also
 
04:12:11.550 --> 04:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
work with the access board um and uh
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
we're working with them and making the
 
04:12:18.070 --> 04:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
2010 changes up to date so um I'm going
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
to just read
 
04:12:22.950 --> 04:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
this the while the desire for additional
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
convenience is understandable we must
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
carefully consider the broader
 
04:12:29.229 --> 04:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
implications of this proposed change let
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
me explain the serious concerns this
 
04:12:33.790 --> 04:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
bill would create for our state New
 
04:12:37.710 --> 04:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has 166,000 residents with
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities and it's important to note
 
04:12:42.790 --> 04:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
that this number includes all types of
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
dis abilities not just those requiring
 
04:12:46.239 --> 04:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
dis abilities not just those requiring
parking

04:12:47.670 --> 04:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
parking
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
accommodations yet we currently have
 
04:12:50.239 --> 04:12:52.030 align:start position:0%
accommodations yet we currently have
over

04:12:52.030 --> 04:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:12:56.670 --> 04:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
680,000 permanent parking placards in
 
04:13:00.309 --> 04:13:00.319 align:start position:0%
circulation that's 30
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
1% more permanent parking placards than
 
04:13:07.790 --> 04:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
our total disabled
 
04:13:13.590 --> 04:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
residents our current rate of 60.2 seven
 
04:13:17.149 --> 04:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
placards per 100 population drastically
 
04:13:21.550 --> 04:13:21.560 align:start position:0%

adding more placards would only
 
04:14:29.870 --> 04:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
intensify these existing problems our

current system already has a simple

solution when someone gets a disability
 
04:14:38.429 --> 04:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
plate they also get a portable
 
04:14:41.229 --> 04:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
placard they can move between vehicles
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
with that placard according according to
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
the United spinals association's best
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
practices this approach works well just
 
04:14:52.309 --> 04:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
keep the placard in a purse or on a key
 
04:14:55.109 --> 04:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
rack or something and transfer it to
 
04:14:58.269 --> 04:14:58.279 align:start position:0%

meet with you and share more details

about our research we'd also like to
 
04:15:15.309 --> 04:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
encourage consultation with the

thank you for your time and I'm happy to
 
04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
04:15:25.800 --> 04:15:27.630 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
the

04:15:27.630 --> 04:15:27.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:30.670 --> 04:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
committee representer
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you Mr
 
04:15:38.070 --> 04:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
chair do you have any idea how how that
 
04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
can possibly be with 166 ,000
 
04:15:47.309 --> 04:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
disabled um residents in New Hampshire
 
04:15:47.319 --> 04:15:49.469 align:start position:0%
disabled um residents in New Hampshire
and

04:15:49.469 --> 04:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:54.070 --> 04:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
68,000 placards what I I don't how could
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
how does that happen well what we
 
04:16:01.349 --> 04:16:01.359 align:start position:0%
surmise is that the software programs
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
that DMV has needs to be
 
04:16:07.950 --> 04:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
updated um if you go if you look at the
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
Illinois Illinois is um a poster child
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
for the parking and and placards uh
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
programs what they did is they uh made
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
up four new placards they did a went to
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
a two-tier system and then they recalled
 
04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
all the
 
04:16:31.389 --> 04:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
placards gave everybody their new
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
placards and then anybody left over with
 
04:16:36.670 --> 04:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
the old placards the police confiscated
 
04:16:40.750 --> 04:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
them now we start a new the new software
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
came into the state and they were able
 
04:16:45.950 --> 04:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
to keep track of all of the placards
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
that were coming and going it's really
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
difficult it's like voting when someone
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
dies or moves or whatever it's very
 
04:16:54.950 --> 04:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to keep track of those
 
04:16:58.269 --> 04:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
placards but the new system has a code
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
bar they would be able to scan the
 
04:17:02.910 --> 04:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
police could go up to a car and just
 
04:17:05.550 --> 04:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
quickly scan that and know exactly who
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
owns that plaer if it's being abused or
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
if it's been stolen um we have online
 
04:17:12.359 --> 04:17:13.910 align:start position:0%
if it's been stolen um we have online
doctors

04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
that uh give out disability placards now
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
and we have uh people going on Amazon
 
04:17:23.070 --> 04:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
you can look on Amazon and just order a
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
placard uh if they're rampant so my big
 
04:17:30.469 --> 04:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
concern with this is if we increase
 
04:17:32.590 --> 04:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
these plates we're going to increase
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
placards now there is one option if he
 
04:17:40.670 --> 04:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
wants to say I have 10
 
04:17:44.109 --> 04:17:44.119 align:start position:0%
cars and I want a plate for every car
 
04:17:48.189 --> 04:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
you can purchase a specialty dis um
 
04:17:50.269 --> 04:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
accessible plate for each of those
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
Vehicles it's
 
04:17:55.109 --> 04:17:55.119 align:start position:0%
$50 but we need something written in the
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
rules that they cannot get a placard for
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
each one of those too because then those
 
04:18:03.550 --> 04:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
10 placards are going to be abused
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
somehow he might drop them getting out
 
04:18:08.550 --> 04:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
of the car the grandchild might grab it
 
04:18:10.830 --> 04:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
and use it for their
 
04:18:15.290 --> 04:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
car so we need to re that stuff in
 
04:18:15.300 --> 04:18:16.790 align:start position:0%
car so we need to re that stuff in
[Music]

04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:18:19.469 --> 04:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your
 
04:18:22.990 --> 04:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
question any other questions from the
 
04:18:27.109 --> 04:18:27.119 align:start position:0%
committee I actually have one yes
 
04:18:31.469 --> 04:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
um how does I guess my question is how
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.109 --> 04:18:40.119 align:start position:0%
this my brother has a disability he has
 
04:18:40.119 --> 04:18:40.910 align:start position:0%
this my brother has a disability he has
a

04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:18:43.109 --> 04:18:43.119 align:start position:0%
placard I guess what I'm asking is why
 
04:18:45.189 --> 04:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
did he get a placard versus
 
04:18:47.630 --> 04:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
plates is there a reason why someone
 
04:18:49.510 --> 04:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
would get plates versus a placard and
 
04:18:50.990 --> 04:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
someone else gets a placard versus a
 
04:18:53.790 --> 04:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
plate absolutely it's it's what they
 
04:18:56.670 --> 04:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
requested you have the option of asking
 
04:18:59.790 --> 04:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
for either one of them so whoever filled
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
out the
 
04:19:03.550 --> 04:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
application um put down what what they
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
thought was
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
best all right thank you you're welcome
 
04:19:08.710 --> 04:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for question any other
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:19:12.109 --> 04:19:12.119 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:26.070 --> 04:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
you okay the chair now would like to
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
Howard who is in support of the
 
04:19:35.349 --> 04:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill and is asking for three minutes
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
welcome back to Transportation
 
04:19:39.630 --> 04:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable committee members
 
04:19:43.229 --> 04:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
for having me yet again uh my name is
 
04:19:44.830 --> 04:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
04:19:46.389 --> 04:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington in
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 uh I'm in support of
 
04:19:52.469 --> 04:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
h259 because uh as the representative
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
who introduced The Bill had stated it
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
affects plates only and as somebody who
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
has a mo mobility disability I broke my
 
04:20:02.910 --> 04:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
back when I was 16 I had an L4 burst
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
fracture uh and I've needed uh handicap
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
placards ever since the thing is is that
 
04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the placards in
 
04:20:12.790 --> 04:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
this situation and that's a separate
 
04:20:16.109 --> 04:20:16.119 align:start position:0%
part of the RSA I do have uh the section
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
that is affected here which is RSA
 
04:20:22.550 --> 04:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
26188 uh and it the language in the bill
 
04:20:24.830 --> 04:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
says explicitly a person with a walking
 
04:20:27.550 --> 04:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
disability may receive uh separate
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
special number plates for each motor
 
04:20:31.870 --> 04:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle owned by a person it has nothing
 
04:20:35.109 --> 04:20:35.119 align:start position:0%
to do with the placards so that is why
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this as somebody who's
 
04:20:38.109 --> 04:20:38.119 align:start position:0%
family owns four different types of
 
04:20:40.389 --> 04:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
vehicles it is something where it is
 
04:20:43.510 --> 04:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
kind of playing uh a jug Ling game of
 
04:20:44.950 --> 04:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where I need to put
 
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
my placard uh the next day but it's
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
something where as a younger person as
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
somebody who has my uh my mental uh
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
faculty still in place there are older
 
04:20:56.910 --> 04:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who do need these disability
 
04:20:58.750 --> 04:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
placards where they do need to move it
 
04:21:00.710 --> 04:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
from car to car and sometimes they might
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
mess up it's easier if we just allow
 
04:21:05.229 --> 04:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
these people to have the plates on the
 
04:21:06.910 --> 04:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
front of their vehicle because then they
 
04:21:09.389 --> 04:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
will never be able to forget it uh with
 
04:21:10.830 --> 04:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
that being said uh I'm open to any
 
04:21:13.309 --> 04:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you any
 
04:21:15.109 --> 04:21:15.119 align:start position:0%

committee not seeing any thank you sir
 
04:21:17.640 --> 04:21:20.469 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you sir
thank

04:21:20.469 --> 04:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
you chair now would like to recognize uh
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
Rod Sims who's representing himself
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
who's requesting three minutes who is
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
also opposing the bill welcome to
 
04:21:34.670 --> 04:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation good afternoon committee
 
04:21:36.670 --> 04:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Rod Sims I'm the husband of
 
04:21:39.710 --> 04:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
Melinda Sims and her full-time caregiver
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
um my concern is the way we see the
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
wording it's it includes placards and
 
04:21:46.990 --> 04:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
right now since I'm the one that usually
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
does most of the driving and stuff uh
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
give you a day in my life sometimes
 
04:21:53.710 --> 04:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
we'll have to leave an hour or a half an
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
hour at least uh to allow time to go
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
find an adequate parking place at one of
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
her doctor's visits because um I'll pull
 
04:22:04.990 --> 04:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
in and we have a very large van she has
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
that her chair weighs 450 pounds without
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
her in it we have a commercial lift in
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
this van and when it deploys you have to
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
have the very large deployment area
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
um we'll pull up to some place and it'll
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
say van parking place and you'll see a
 
04:22:19.750 --> 04:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
little Toyota Corolla parked in there so
 
04:22:21.189 --> 04:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
we may have to sit there for a half hour
 
04:22:22.910 --> 04:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
or an hour to wait for the individual
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
who's parking in the van parking spot to
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
come out and move their vehicle now they
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
don't have a license plate saying
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
disabled but they have a placard laying
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
up on the dash because I'll literally
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
get out and look to see if they have a
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
disability plate displayed someplace and
 
04:22:39.109 --> 04:22:39.119 align:start position:0%
I sat there and wait for this person to
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
come out so now you see this guy that's
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
probably 177 18 years old skipping out
 
04:22:46.349 --> 04:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
of this building walking with no obvious
 
04:22:48.910 --> 04:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
disability whatsoever come out and get
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
in these car pull out and leave so to
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
me we've got too many plates floating or
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
we got too many placers floating around
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
that people are abusing don't know how
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
they're getting if grandma died Grandpa
 
04:23:01.550 --> 04:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
died and they took their their placard
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
we don't know but our system right now
 
04:23:06.309 --> 04:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't do a good job of
 
04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring where the placards are the
 
04:23:11.710 --> 04:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
plates are pretty much taken care of but
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
not the placards
 
04:23:15.389 --> 04:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
so I would support this bill if it said
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
that you could have as many license
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
plates as you want but only one
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
placard because uh the the situation
 
04:23:26.149 --> 04:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
reparo gave about his dad uh having
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
problems going to the airport parking
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
his truck but yet he still needed
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
his um placard to take with him to the
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
state that he was going to be driving a
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
rental car in that makes total sense so
 
04:23:39.790 --> 04:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
if his truck had had a plate on it
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
disability plate that problem wouldn't
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
have started to begin with
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
but my main concern is if we expand if
 
04:23:48.429 --> 04:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
somebody has 10 Vehicles they want 10
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
plates because right now I've got four
 
04:23:52.510 --> 04:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles and I've only got one plate on
 
04:23:54.750 --> 04:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
her van my ve my four vehicles that I
 
04:23:56.990 --> 04:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
drive none of them have plates so I
 
04:23:58.429 --> 04:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
constantly have to make sure I've got my
 
04:24:01.389 --> 04:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
placard with me um so I would support it
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
for plates but the placers should be
 
04:24:05.630 --> 04:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
limited to one placard because I see no
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
reason why you should need more than one
 
04:24:09.309 --> 04:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
placard and then we ought to bring the
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
system down to what my wife said like
 
04:24:13.510 --> 04:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
Illinois did and and we should recall
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
all the placards start from ground zero
 
04:24:18.870 --> 04:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
and you should have a medical purpose
 
04:24:21.630 --> 04:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
for having that placard and I think also
 
04:24:23.309 --> 04:24:23.319 align:start position:0%
it might be a good idea to have that
 
04:24:24.910 --> 04:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
placard listed on your license your
 
04:24:27.309 --> 04:24:27.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license as an assist of if you
 
04:24:28.950 --> 04:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
have to wear glasses or if you have to
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
have some kind of assistant device to
 
04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
operate the car it should be noted on
 
04:24:33.990 --> 04:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
there the serial number that's on your
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
placard should be called out on your
 
04:24:38.990 --> 04:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
license I think that would help a lot
 
04:24:40.149 --> 04:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
with people using them that wasn't
 
04:24:42.750 --> 04:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
entitled to use them thank you very much
 
04:24:45.309 --> 04:24:45.319 align:start position:0%

04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%

chair person like chair like now
 
04:27:19.910 --> 04:27:19.920 align:start position:0%

04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
DMV uh who's requesting three

04:27:30.990 --> 04:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the chair so
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
DMV is not in support or oppose we're
 
04:27:34.510 --> 04:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
here more for just informational um
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
based on some testimony we've heard here
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
today to answer some of your questions
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
you've had throughout this so the
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
placard and plate are tied to an
 
04:27:47.109 --> 04:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
individual so you have the option when
 
04:27:48.429 --> 04:27:48.439 align:start position:0%
you have a walking disability
 
04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
application filled out to either obtain
 
04:27:54.469 --> 04:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
one plate and one placard or two
 
04:27:56.830 --> 04:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
placards and then a few years ago it was
 
04:27:59.229 --> 04:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
changed through legislative process to
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
add that you can also have an additional
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
plate on a motorcycle So currently those
 
04:28:06.950 --> 04:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
are your options to have um addressing
 
04:28:08.990 --> 04:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
the two members in one household again
 
04:28:10.550 --> 04:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's tied to the individual so if you
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
have two members of a household who own
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
one vehicle one member could get one
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
plate on that vehicle and one placard
 
04:28:21.070 --> 04:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
the other member could get two placards
 
04:28:22.510 --> 04:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
so they would have three placards
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
amongst them in one plate if they owned
 
04:28:25.990 --> 04:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
a motorcycle they could also get a
 
04:28:28.670 --> 04:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
motorcycle plate uh we did run some
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
recent numbers I'm not sure where the
 
04:28:33.950 --> 04:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
600,000 placards came from um we
 
04:28:38.149 --> 04:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
currently have on file that there are
 
04:28:38.159 --> 04:28:39.670 align:start position:0%
currently have on file that there are
132,133

04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
132,133
 
04:28:43.950 --> 04:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
permanent placards and
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
3,715 temporary placards that are active
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
currently um so those are the current
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
numbers that we have um let's see we
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
have had recent discussions I was
 
04:28:56.510 --> 04:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned with the DMV systems about the
 
04:28:58.870 --> 04:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
placard process and we were working with
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission of disability
 
04:29:03.950 --> 04:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
on different processes with that
 
04:29:07.269 --> 04:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
whether there is a downfall when someone
 
04:29:09.309 --> 04:29:09.319 align:start position:0%
misplaces or loses or a placard is
 
04:29:11.349 --> 04:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
stolen on how that's replaced and so
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing different
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
protocols and how we handle that but
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
that is just a little bit more of
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
clarification that we want to provide on
 
04:29:21.510 --> 04:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
the placard process with the
 
04:29:24.550 --> 04:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
DMB any questions from the committee
 
04:29:24.560 --> 04:29:26.269 align:start position:0%
DMB any questions from the committee
representative

04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:29.309 --> 04:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
syes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question um as this bill is
 
04:29:36.990 --> 04:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
currently written does that mean that um
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
and under your current way of operating
 
04:29:42.910 --> 04:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
um each person could get their own plate
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
but they would be charged separately for
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
each plate for each plate correct and
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
the charge would be uh the plate for
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
handicap is $8 correct it's $8 for the
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
plate so it's so so it's only $8 to get
 
04:29:59.469 --> 04:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
a second plate if you have a second
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle if you are have two
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
people so right now you're not eligible
 
04:30:08.030 --> 04:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
for a second vehicle this bill is trying
 
04:30:11.229 --> 04:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
to enact that you are only eligible for
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
one plate
 
04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
and one plard for one person for one
 
04:30:18.990 --> 04:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
person but two people could in fact have
 
04:30:20.830 --> 04:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
two different plates if you own two
 
04:30:23.830 --> 04:30:23.840 align:start position:0%

132,133

04:31:07.750 --> 04:31:07.760 align:start position:0%

thank you representative foot thank you
 
04:31:16.030 --> 04:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
m thank you um on the placards there's a
 
04:31:18.550 --> 04:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
number on the bottom to the if a if a
 
04:31:20.309 --> 04:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
police officer was to look at that could
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
they ascertain who that belongs to if
 
04:31:24.630 --> 04:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
they were if they were checking on a
 
04:31:27.309 --> 04:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
spot they cannot buy the number um
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
however if you have a walking
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
disability privilege um it prints a
 
04:31:34.670 --> 04:31:34.680 align:start position:0%
handicap symbol on your
 
04:31:37.710 --> 04:31:37.720 align:start position:0%

Fox thank you Mr chair do you have the

if you'd like that okay please just out
 
04:31:55.189 --> 04:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
of curiosity thank you representative
 
04:31:57.590 --> 04:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr
 
04:32:00.830 --> 04:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm curious about what you know
 
04:32:02.830 --> 04:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
of the the placards that you can
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
purchase on Amazon um is that anything
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
that anybody is checking up on to see if
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
you actually can purchase New Hampshire
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
walking disability placards on Amazon I
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
do not know that and I have not looked
 
04:32:21.269 --> 04:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
that up thank you could you we we can
 
04:32:22.469 --> 04:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um what
 
04:32:30.269 --> 04:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
are some of the protocols that would be
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
considered to mitigate the lost and
 
04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
stolen placards like expiration dates or
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
barcodes or so we have talked about um
 
04:32:38.910 --> 04:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
so law enforcement uses a program called
 
04:32:40.590 --> 04:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
spots to look at when you're pulled over
 
04:32:42.349 --> 04:32:42.359 align:start position:0%
and whether or not we can report that
 
04:32:44.349 --> 04:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
placard number through there so when you
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
are looked up again this becomes more of
 
04:32:48.389 --> 04:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
an Enforcement issue on how law
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement were to enforce that um or
 
04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
as it was mentioned printing either the
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
placard number on the license or vice
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
versa printing the license number on the
 
04:33:02.670 --> 04:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
plaque Ard there's other both those
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:08.789 --> 04:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
discussed follow up would it make sense
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
to put a an expiration date on the
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
placard so that they are stolen or lost
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
they're only good for a limited amount
 
04:33:17.551 --> 04:33:17.561 align:start position:0%
of time so that they can't be so renewed
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
or that's actually a very good question
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
um so they actually do expire so even
 
04:33:22.990 --> 04:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
though they're permanent placards
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
they're only good for the term of your
 
04:33:26.429 --> 04:33:26.439 align:start position:0%
license so they match your license so
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
there are fiveyear expiration dates um
 
04:33:31.629 --> 04:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
whole punched into them and then every
 
04:33:33.869 --> 04:33:33.879 align:start position:0%
five years you bring in a new doctor's
 
04:33:37.349 --> 04:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
note um to have that
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
reassigned representative foot thank you
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
m i I'll uh yield
 
04:33:44.990 --> 04:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
my question was answered thank you any
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
committee not see
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:58.830 --> 04:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
$480 we got two
 
04:34:05.429 --> 04:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
on you you can buy a an ID number
 
04:34:07.869 --> 04:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
permanent blackard do they look like the

New Hampshire the blue and white yes
 
04:34:10.039 --> 04:34:10.709 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the blue and white yes
they

04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:34:14.349 --> 04:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
do interesting
 
04:34:14.359 --> 04:34:22.949 align:start position:0%
do interesting
$480

04:34:22.949 --> 04:34:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
interesting you can even get them for
 
04:34:25.279 --> 04:34:28.789 align:start position:0%
interesting you can even get them for
your

04:34:28.789 --> 04:34:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:31.150 --> 04:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
luggage thank you I feel like this is
 
04:34:33.150 --> 04:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
the Home Shopping Network right
 
04:34:36.109 --> 04:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
now representative foot thank you in
 
04:34:39.390 --> 04:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
light of that question so where the
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
police don't have access to that now is
 
04:34:43.390 --> 04:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
there a way to incorporate that so for
 
04:34:45.949 --> 04:34:45.959 align:start position:0%
these ones that a purchase online that
 
04:34:47.789 --> 04:34:47.799 align:start position:0%
they can validate that those are
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
accurate or not um we'd have to do
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
system changes um spots is a special
 
04:34:55.629 --> 04:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
program through them where they'd have
 
04:34:57.990 --> 04:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
to um have the real estate to list that
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
and then connect with the DMV map system
 
04:35:02.629 --> 04:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
to pull that information over um so
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's definitely something that can be
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
looked into Paul follow is there a a
 
04:35:07.840 --> 04:35:09.310 align:start position:0%
looked into Paul follow is there a a
large

04:35:09.310 --> 04:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
large
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
monetary to that or this changes it that
 
04:35:15.189 --> 04:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
would be dependent on how many hours
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
that work would need it be interfacing
 
04:35:21.390 --> 04:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
with a program so it could be a few like
 
04:35:24.150 --> 04:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
$30,000 probably thank you
 
04:35:24.160 --> 04:35:25.269 align:start position:0%
$30,000 probably thank you
representative

04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:27.429 --> 04:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
Crawford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:35:29.709 --> 04:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I've got I'm
 
04:35:32.310 --> 04:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
curious when they came out with the
 
04:35:33.789 --> 04:35:33.799 align:start position:0%
placard I was always under the
 
04:35:36.189 --> 04:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
impression that was a temporary thing so
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
if you had surgery or whatnot you got a
 
04:35:40.070 --> 04:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
placard and it lasted for six months
 
04:35:41.349 --> 04:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't walk and you know
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
you used it so the the problem here is
 
04:35:47.070 --> 04:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
is plates I'm assuming because people
 
04:35:48.750 --> 04:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
are carrying around placards because
 
04:35:51.670 --> 04:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
they can only get one set of plate for
 
04:35:55.310 --> 04:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
one person in the household right
 
04:35:58.109 --> 04:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it be better to give plates
 
04:36:00.109 --> 04:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
than to have these placards all over the
 
04:36:02.551 --> 04:36:02.561 align:start position:0%
place and only issue placards to people
 
04:36:04.830 --> 04:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
who are temporarily disabled because of
 
04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
the condition that they have that's
 
04:36:08.910 --> 04:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
another option so personal experience my
 
04:36:12.230 --> 04:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
mom has Ms um so she does have plate on
 
04:36:14.910 --> 04:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
her vehicle and then she carries the
 
04:36:17.310 --> 04:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
plard with her in her purse for when I
 
04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
pick her up and take her out so that's
 
04:36:21.470 --> 04:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
kind of the option of there and it's
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
opposite right now where the Placer
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
drives the walking
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
disability process where you always are
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
allocated a placard in our system no
 
04:36:32.670 --> 04:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
matter what and then you can choose to
 
04:36:34.750 --> 04:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
either get an additional placard or get
 
04:36:36.029 --> 04:36:36.039 align:start position:0%
a plate on your
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle welcome okay any other questions
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee not see any thank you
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%

04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
nobody else so at this point I will

close the hearing on HP
 
04:36:53.310 --> 04:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
259 our next bill will be HB 287 which
 
04:37:10.510 --> 04:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.520 --> 04:37:40.429 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

04:37:40.429 --> 04:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:38.429 --> 04:38:38.439 align:start position:0%

on HB 287 requiring police departments
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
to provide fire departments with certain
 
04:38:49.869 --> 04:38:49.879 align:start position:0%
motorist personel and insurance
 
04:38:52.510 --> 04:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
information following a motor vehicle
 
04:38:54.789 --> 04:38:54.799 align:start position:0%
incident the chair would like to
 
04:38:58.629 --> 04:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
recognize representative PR sponsor of
 
04:39:01.230 --> 04:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
the bill welcome sir I hope your car
 
04:39:04.949 --> 04:39:04.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
of the recer didn't show up for two
 
04:39:10.429 --> 04:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
hours I called tripa said Hey where's my
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
recer we don't have that call can we
 
04:39:15.070 --> 04:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
make it a call now that would be really
 
04:39:17.510 --> 04:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
great because it's getting cold out here
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
anyway my name is Mark PR representing
 
04:39:24.429 --> 04:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 15 Manchester Ward 8 um so
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
today I had a fire chief reach out to me
 
04:39:30.750 --> 04:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
um Tilton
 
04:39:33.349 --> 04:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
Northfield one of the Departments is
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
great on giving them information because
 
04:39:38.190 --> 04:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
if they use Speedy dry or booms or some
 
04:39:40.150 --> 04:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
kind of consumable they want to be able
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
to build that back to it
 
04:39:44.190 --> 04:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
Insurance the other police department
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
says yeah tough you didn't get it too
 
04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
bad I ain't giving it to you so he's
 
04:39:52.590 --> 04:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
just looking for some way to be able to
 
04:39:54.750 --> 04:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to a police department and say
 
04:39:59.030 --> 04:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
hey I need the information from that uh
 
04:40:02.070 --> 04:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
person and them having to come forward
 
04:40:04.030 --> 04:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
with you know their name address
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
insurance company policy number those
 
04:40:08.430 --> 04:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
kind of things pretty simple they
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
already have it it's a matter of walking
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
over to the the copy machine going here
 
04:40:17.310 --> 04:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
you go right but for some reason some
 
04:40:18.788 --> 04:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
police departments just don't want to
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
can't be bothered to furnish that
 
04:40:22.470 --> 04:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
information so that he's just looking
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
for a way to make that happen and I kind
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
of agree with him because we use a lot
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
of stuff and if we can't get in this day
 
04:40:32.230 --> 04:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
and age we can't get paid for ambulance
 
04:40:32.240 --> 04:40:33.230 align:start position:0%
and age we can't get paid for ambulance
calls

04:40:33.230 --> 04:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
calls
 
04:40:37.350 --> 04:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
so and now we're losing money on on on
 
04:40:39.390 --> 04:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
um the things that we have to use for
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
HazMat and things like that
 
04:40:44.190 --> 04:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
that's all I
 
04:40:47.230 --> 04:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
got any questions from the
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:40:53.550 --> 04:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
PR thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
04:40:56.030 --> 04:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question why is this
 
04:40:58.590 --> 04:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
information not a matter of public
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
record once the police department has it
 
04:41:03.430 --> 04:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's a really good
 
04:41:07.430 --> 04:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
question but uh it is they just choose
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
not to go through the effort to readily
 
04:41:13.110 --> 04:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
make it available some of them
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
apparently and I I have no idea
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
why because my Police Department that I
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
work with I work for eping fire and they
 
04:41:24.868 --> 04:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
need up follow
 
04:41:30.628 --> 04:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
up um I'll bet if you made a couple of
 
04:41:33.390 --> 04:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
91a requests formally that you would get
 
04:41:35.948 --> 04:41:35.958 align:start position:0%
the information every time that's way
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
too much
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
work representative Hill thank you Mr
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you repres
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
04:41:46.030 --> 04:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
if this
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
passes um and and you make that same
 
04:41:53.230 --> 04:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
request um from Tilton Northfield uh
 
04:41:56.190 --> 04:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
which is my fire department by the way
 
04:41:59.788 --> 04:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
um to uh to the police department and
 
04:42:05.430 --> 04:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
they say um no and you say it's the law
 
04:42:07.708 --> 04:42:07.718 align:start position:0%
then what happens then maybe we should
 
04:42:11.550 --> 04:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
have a penalty if they don't does I'm
 
04:42:14.190 --> 04:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
glad you brought that up maybe we should
 
04:42:16.510 --> 04:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
amend it to put a penalty in there you
 
04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
know I must be a nice guy because I just
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
think of if there's a law on the books
 
04:42:23.470 --> 04:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
and we say hey can can we have it that
 
04:42:25.030 --> 04:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
they would just say yes but you're
 
04:42:27.270 --> 04:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
probably right they'll probably just say
 
04:42:31.390 --> 04:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
no um follow up follow up thank you so
 
04:42:33.948 --> 04:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
let's say that there's a penalty on this
 
04:42:38.670 --> 04:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
um who's going to enforce it State Polie
 
04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
how about that AG's office
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
so we should look forward to an
 
04:42:46.868 --> 04:42:46.878 align:start position:0%
amendment coming I'd be happy to make
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
one thank
 
04:42:53.590 --> 04:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
you I actually have a question okay how
 
04:42:57.550 --> 04:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
often is this happening so I only have
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
this one person's
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
perspective um and like I said one of
 
04:43:06.270 --> 04:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
those police departments is forthcoming
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
the other one never does it so depending
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
on where the accident is
 
04:43:13.708 --> 04:43:13.718 align:start position:0%
and and I've also kind of heard
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
grumblings that there's some other
 
04:43:16.750 --> 04:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
police departments that can't be
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
bothered as well so it just makes it
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
more difficult you know and and
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't get that information
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
from that person at the time because
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
usually the police are yelling at me to
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
get my big red truck out of traffic so
 
04:43:35.430 --> 04:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
they can get it moving again so and they
 
04:43:36.868 --> 04:43:36.878 align:start position:0%
have the license they're getting their
 
04:43:36.878 --> 04:43:38.270 align:start position:0%
have the license they're getting their
report

04:43:38.270 --> 04:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:43:40.510 --> 04:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
information and sometimes I don't have
 
04:43:41.628 --> 04:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
access to it
 
04:43:44.030 --> 04:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
and I've gone through back to my Police
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
Department said hey you got that guy's
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
information yep sure it's here right
 
04:43:49.708 --> 04:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
right here here you go but apparently
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
some other police departments don't want
 
04:43:54.350 --> 04:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
to play that play
 
04:43:57.750 --> 04:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
nicely representative Peto thank you Mr
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:44:01.788 --> 04:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
question I forgive me in case I missed
 
04:44:06.030 --> 04:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
it but could you walk through
 
04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
um what the need is why would the fire
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
departments need these details provided
 
04:44:13.750 --> 04:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
to them by the police department so we
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
can build their auto insurance for our
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
consumables like Speedy dry if they dump
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
a bunch of fuel oil or radiator fluid we
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
have to put the Speedy dry down pick it
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
up sometimes we need to put the uh
 
04:44:34.670 --> 04:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
Hazmat Booms to block SES and stuff so
 
04:44:37.708 --> 04:44:37.718 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get into the uh drainage
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
system may I ask to follow up follow up
 
04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:43.868 --> 04:44:43.878 align:start position:0%
um in
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
in is there any consideration with how
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh an ambulance service ties into to the
 
04:44:52.670 --> 04:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
fire response are they always integrated
 
04:44:54.510 --> 04:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
or are they usually separate and is it
 
04:44:56.708 --> 04:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
based on the town and I only bring that
 
04:44:58.390 --> 04:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
up because of the the billing aspect as
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
you so based on the town some of them my
 
04:45:06.030 --> 04:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
eping is right but we're
 
04:45:08.350 --> 04:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
getting we don't get their Auto
 
04:45:11.868 --> 04:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
information we get their
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
um health insurance right and a lot of
 
04:45:20.190 --> 04:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
times we don't transport so we don't get
 
04:45:22.350 --> 04:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
anything we walk up to them hey you okay
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
or the police wave off the ambulance
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
because nobody's hurt but the firetruck
 
04:45:30.430 --> 04:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
stops to check for hazards electrical
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
fuel oil radiator fluid and any other
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
such hazards that we have to mitigate uh
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
so they don't create a bigger problem
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
down the road thank you
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I shut it off I always struggle
 
04:45:51.590 --> 04:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
with these things
 
04:45:54.868 --> 04:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure is there additional I don't know
 
04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
the answer to this which is why I'm
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
asking the question um is there add are
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
there additional requirements that would
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
be necessary under the rsas to allow
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
fire departments to bill
 
04:46:13.708 --> 04:46:13.718 align:start position:0%
for ancillary services that like I know
 
04:46:15.868 --> 04:46:15.878 align:start position:0%
I know they have they can build for
 
04:46:15.878 --> 04:46:16.948 align:start position:0%
I know they have they can build for
ambulance

04:46:16.948 --> 04:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
04:46:19.948 --> 04:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
services but they there are some things
 
04:46:22.030 --> 04:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
they can't build for and I'm just I want
 
04:46:25.390 --> 04:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure we cover that base if the
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
as far as I know from the chief that
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
asked me to put this in when he gets
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
that information he is billing with
 
04:46:36.548 --> 04:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
success so I'm assuming it's
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to make sure we
 
04:46:47.350 --> 04:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
cover the base so that it can be done if
 
04:46:51.868 --> 04:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
it's if if you know we get far enough
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
along any other questions from the
 
04:46:58.110 --> 04:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%

04:47:07.030 --> 04:47:07.040 align:start position:0%

04:47:39.840 --> 04:48:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

2:51 I'm going to open the public

where removal is reasonably necessary
 
04:52:11.310 --> 04:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
for repair or
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
restoration and the chair would like to
 
04:52:16.070 --> 04:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
recognize representative home who is the
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor welcome sir to
 
04:52:21.070 --> 04:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank you Mr chairman
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee I'm
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
putting in this bill at the request of a
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
client of mine client a constituent of
 
04:52:31.110 --> 04:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
mine from Nashville Nash The Honorable
 
04:52:33.070 --> 04:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative Larry Arts former House
 
04:52:36.350 --> 04:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
member who has a hobby and a business
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
restoring antique
 
04:52:40.548 --> 04:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
cars now the problem when you restore
 
04:52:43.310 --> 04:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
antique cars is that they get pretty
 
04:52:45.590 --> 04:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
Rusty and once in a while that rust
 
04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
comes out to the side of the car where
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
the name plates
 
04:52:51.510 --> 04:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
attached and if you got to replace the
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
piece of rust that has the uh V the vent
 
04:52:57.548 --> 04:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
plate on it
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
um then you got a problem trying to move
 
04:53:01.750 --> 04:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
that vent plate to the repaired part of
 
04:53:04.030 --> 04:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
the car it's not legal to take a vent
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
plate off and put it on a different
 
04:53:08.708 --> 04:53:08.718 align:start position:0%
chassis and technically this is a
 
04:53:10.750 --> 04:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
different chassis when you repair the
 
04:53:14.470 --> 04:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
part that had the V plate on it so the
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
bill is to allow res people who restore
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
antique Vehicles defined as model year
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
1981 and earlier to do these kind of
 
04:53:25.230 --> 04:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
repairs to not just repair the upper
 
04:53:27.628 --> 04:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
body but to repair some of the chassis
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
and specifically be able to move the
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
vent plate to the new
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
chassis and with that I'd like to turn
 
04:53:37.110 --> 04:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
the testimony over to uh my colleague
 
04:53:38.628 --> 04:53:38.638 align:start position:0%
representative The Honorable
 
04:53:40.110 --> 04:53:40.120 align:start position:0%

04:53:41.708 --> 04:53:41.718 align:start position:0%
Larry
 
04:53:45.070 --> 04:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
Ys he's next on my list so hold up on
 
04:53:48.190 --> 04:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
that any questions from the
 
04:53:50.910 --> 04:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative gon thank you
 
04:53:53.670 --> 04:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair sir would it make more sense to
 
04:53:56.230 --> 04:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
put a time uh line rather than a year on
 
04:53:58.948 --> 04:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
this such as a vehicle 40 years older
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
older 45 years old or older because it
 
04:54:04.548 --> 04:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
seems to me that 19881 is a specific
 
04:54:06.670 --> 04:54:06.680 align:start position:0%
point in time where the definition of
 
04:54:09.390 --> 04:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
antique is changing as we grow older
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
every minute it certainly does make
 
04:54:13.708 --> 04:54:13.718 align:start position:0%
sense uh it used to be 25 years for an
 
04:54:16.430 --> 04:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
antique car this is over 40 years I go
 
04:54:18.150 --> 04:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
back to kind of the premission days when
 
04:54:20.548 --> 04:54:20.558 align:start position:0%
he could actually work on
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
cars uh but I'll defer that response to
 
04:54:28.110 --> 04:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
my uh colleague rep uh Mr
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%

04:54:33.868 --> 04:54:33.878 align:start position:0%

you with that I'd like to call up uh
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
Larry Arts who's representing himself
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
who is in support of the bill welcome
 
04:54:45.310 --> 04:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
sir to Transportation thank you Mr chair
 
04:54:46.830 --> 04:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
04:54:48.750 --> 04:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
record my name is Lawrence Arts I live
 
04:54:52.110 --> 04:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
in Nashua and just a slight correction
 
04:54:54.510 --> 04:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
and it it I have it's not a business but
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
a hobby of mine restoring old cars I've
 
04:54:59.230 --> 04:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
been involved with that uh activity for
 
04:55:00.750 --> 04:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
many many
 
04:55:03.150 --> 04:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
years to answer your question
 
04:55:07.150 --> 04:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
representative about the 1981 cut off
 
04:55:10.590 --> 04:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
um 1981 was the beginning of the the
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
standardized 17 digigit Vin format that
 
04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
all cars all vehicles all motor vehicles
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
and trailers have to abide by when
 
04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
they're manufactured and that's why I
 
04:55:26.430 --> 04:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
requested that the uh the cut off be at
 
04:55:31.430 --> 04:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
1981 although if if the committee feels
 
04:55:35.868 --> 04:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
that um 40 years or some other
 
04:55:39.990 --> 04:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh age is appropriate then I have no
 
04:55:42.430 --> 04:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
problem with
 
04:55:48.030 --> 04:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
that uh back in the 50s and 60s the see
 
04:55:51.270 --> 04:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
the original Vin tampering law was
 
04:55:53.788 --> 04:55:53.798 align:start position:0%
written back at a time when no one
 
04:55:53.798 --> 04:55:54.868 align:start position:0%
written back at a time when no one
really

04:55:54.868 --> 04:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:55:59.310 --> 04:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
foresaw people restoring Motor Vehicles
 
04:55:59.320 --> 04:56:00.190 align:start position:0%
foresaw people restoring Motor Vehicles
as

04:56:00.190 --> 04:56:00.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:56:03.788 --> 04:56:03.798 align:start position:0%
Antiques and also at that
 
04:56:08.110 --> 04:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
time manufacturers had their own format
 
04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
their own placement for Vin plates
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
on these vehicles and as such um now
 
04:56:17.788 --> 04:56:17.798 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these cars that are being
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
restored had been sitting in junkyards
 
04:56:23.070 --> 04:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
been sitting in
 
04:56:26.628 --> 04:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
fields and just you know through
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
time they uh they have to undergo some
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
major restoration and with the
 
04:56:37.590 --> 04:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
proliferation of replacement parts that
 
04:56:39.628 --> 04:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
are body parts that that didn't really
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
exist as a a replacement that are now
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
available today people are taking a
 
04:56:46.910 --> 04:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
rusted body and actually restoring the
 
04:56:50.670 --> 04:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
car General Motors for instance they put
 
04:56:53.110 --> 04:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
their Vin plates on the a pillar down
 
04:56:54.430 --> 04:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
behind the door
 
04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
jam up on the windshield pillar like
 
04:57:00.670 --> 04:57:00.680 align:start position:0%
they were on the 55 through 7 Chevys or
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
they would put them somewhere on the
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
cowl but if that portion of the car
 
04:57:08.430 --> 04:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
needs to be replaced because it's rusted
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
or damaged it's going to
 
04:57:13.230 --> 04:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
NE necessitate moving the VIN
 
04:57:16.230 --> 04:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
temporarily to be able to repair that
 
04:57:17.470 --> 04:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
section of the
 
04:57:20.350 --> 04:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
car and then it gets reattached once the
 
04:57:22.750 --> 04:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
repair is complete but if you go if you
 
04:57:25.510 --> 04:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
go by the letter of the law it's
 
04:57:29.948 --> 04:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
technically an illegal activity and what
 
04:57:32.430 --> 04:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
happened I'll tell you a little bit of a
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
incident that happened here a few years
 
04:57:37.470 --> 04:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
ago there was a man in Kansas who bought
 
04:57:41.948 --> 04:57:41.958 align:start position:0%
a 1959 Chevy C vet he he actually bought
 
04:57:44.190 --> 04:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
the car in Indiana but he attempted to
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
register it in his home state when he
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
went to get the car inspected the uh
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
Highway Patrol determined that the VIN
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
had been removed and then reattached and
 
04:57:57.708 --> 04:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
then what happened was they impounded
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
his car as Contraband because they
 
04:58:02.750 --> 04:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
thought that maybe that the they they
 
04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
just presumed that the car was stolen
 
04:58:07.948 --> 04:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
because the VIN did not have its
 
04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
original rivets or its original
 
04:58:13.350 --> 04:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
um spot Wells or whatever the case may
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
be I think on a Corvette because it was
 
04:58:18.670 --> 04:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
fiberglass they uh riveted it and I'm
 
04:58:21.350 --> 04:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
not exactly sure because I'm not a I'm
 
04:58:24.390 --> 04:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
not uh really into the Corvettes per
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
se and according to Kansas law because
 
04:58:30.310 --> 04:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
that b had been removed the car would
 
04:58:31.948 --> 04:58:31.958 align:start position:0%
have had to been
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
destroyed because it would have been
 
04:58:36.310 --> 04:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
presumed until he proved otherwise that
 
04:58:37.670 --> 04:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
the car was not
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
stolen and uh so as a
 
04:58:43.230 --> 04:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
result of all kinds of litigation the
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
car sat outside for
 
04:58:50.548 --> 04:58:50.558 align:start position:0%
years while this uh issue wound through
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
the courts eventually he was able to
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
get he was able to Prevail and he was
 
04:58:58.670 --> 04:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
able to ultimately register it but it
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
became a extreme hardship for him and so
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
Kansas changed their law to basically
 
04:59:08.310 --> 04:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
the same language of what I've been
 
04:59:10.948 --> 04:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
proposing to uh to do here for New
 
04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um it they also the State
 
04:59:16.830 --> 04:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
of Arizona which is home to the Barrett
 
04:59:19.948 --> 04:59:19.958 align:start position:0%
Jackson auctions for classic
 
04:59:22.868 --> 04:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
cars they amended their law in the same
 
04:59:26.590 --> 04:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
fashion now federal law allows it but
 
04:59:28.708 --> 04:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
what I can see in New
 
04:59:30.670 --> 04:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state
 
04:59:34.708 --> 04:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
law allows no provision on in the on the
 
04:59:37.628 --> 04:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
activity of res of removing and
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
replacing the VIN to inorder order to
 
04:59:42.990 --> 04:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
facilitate a repair or restoration on
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
the car and I would like to have that
 
04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
exemption put in at the same
 
04:59:55.548 --> 04:59:55.558 align:start position:0%
time the language in the law does not
 
04:59:58.030 --> 04:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
allow for anybody to conceal the
 
05:00:00.310 --> 05:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
identity of a car if the if the person
 
05:00:03.190 --> 05:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
knows that it is stolen you leave those
 
05:00:05.070 --> 05:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
Protections in place but to just carve
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
out that exception for the person that's
 
05:00:10.510 --> 05:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
trying to restore the car
 
05:00:13.150 --> 05:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
and um needs and needs to be able to
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
temporarily remove that uh that VIN tag
 
05:00:18.590 --> 05:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
from the car because a lot of guys a lot
 
05:00:20.070 --> 05:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
of people they just do it and they don't
 
05:00:22.948 --> 05:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
tell anybody and you know then they then
 
05:00:24.830 --> 05:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
nobody says anything and you know they
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
can go for years and years but all it
 
05:00:27.990 --> 05:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
takes is just
 
05:00:31.230 --> 05:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
one one officer or something like that
 
05:00:33.948 --> 05:00:33.958 align:start position:0%
uh that that's real Eagle eyed and you
 
05:00:36.430 --> 05:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
know or or you know wants to make a
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
stink about it and they'll cause a lot
 
05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
of problems for that person and what
 
05:00:43.230 --> 05:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
what I would like to do is to avoid that
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
issue and so if anybody has any
 
05:00:46.718 --> 05:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
issue and so if anybody has any
um

05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:51.150 --> 05:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
questions so any questions from the
 
05:00:53.110 --> 05:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
Peto thank you Mr chair for taking make
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh for allowing me and thank you for
 
05:01:01.548 --> 05:01:01.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question um as a uh uh autor
 
05:01:01.558 --> 05:01:02.750 align:start position:0%
taking my question um as a uh uh autor
restoration

05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
restoration
 
05:01:05.430 --> 05:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
Enthusiast do you have any knowledge or
 
05:01:07.910 --> 05:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
comments to the idea of like the VIN
 
05:01:09.708 --> 05:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
number can be found in multiple spots in
 
05:01:11.830 --> 05:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
this same car I believe we have them on
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
the door the
 
05:01:17.708 --> 05:01:17.718 align:start position:0%
dashboard uh the engine block um
 
05:01:21.390 --> 05:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
do how long has that been a thing where
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
the VIN is stamped on strategic spots on
 
05:01:27.670 --> 05:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
the C you know okay different years um I
 
05:01:30.670 --> 05:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
know that in the late 80s they started
 
05:01:32.470 --> 05:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
putting VIN numbers
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
on major body panels like fenders or
 
05:01:42.110 --> 05:01:42.120 align:start position:0%
bumpers um but going back further like I
 
05:01:43.830 --> 05:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
know at least with General Motors
 
05:01:46.670 --> 05:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
Vehicles before
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
1968 the only other Vin that they had on
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
at least like on the Chevy Nova that I'm
 
05:01:56.310 --> 05:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
familiar with because I uh that's the
 
05:01:57.910 --> 05:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
cars that I'm
 
05:02:01.070 --> 05:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
into they have a partial Vin stamped at
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
two places adjacent to each other
 
05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
underneath the driver's side fender on
 
05:02:10.350 --> 05:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
the cowl flange but it's only a partial
 
05:02:14.628 --> 05:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
Vin the first five digits which uh
 
05:02:18.910 --> 05:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
denote the year and the body style is
 
05:02:21.230 --> 05:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
not included in there it's just the
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
plant that it the plant letter
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
designation and its serial
 
05:02:25.680 --> 05:02:27.548 align:start position:0%
designation and its serial
number

05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:02:30.190 --> 05:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
um some of the cars yes they have them
 
05:02:32.350 --> 05:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
in multiple locations but like I said
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
but prior to 1968 each manufacturer had
 
05:02:37.868 --> 05:02:37.878 align:start position:0%
their own methodology and
 
05:02:41.230 --> 05:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
putting uh VIN numbers on on their car I
 
05:02:45.990 --> 05:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
know also back in the 40s maybe even the
 
05:02:48.830 --> 05:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
50s they only put the serial number on
 
05:02:51.310 --> 05:02:51.320 align:start position:0%
the motor they didn't put it anywhere
 
05:02:53.230 --> 05:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
else on the car and if you change the
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
motor you've removed the the VIN number
 
05:02:58.190 --> 05:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
from the car and then in that case I
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't know what happens do they uh are
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
they allowed to make a new vin plate or
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
are they um allowed to um or does the
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
state have to give you a state issued
 
05:03:11.470 --> 05:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
Vin and in that case you have this white
 
05:03:13.590 --> 05:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
sticker that's got the state seal on it
 
05:03:16.150 --> 05:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
and it gets placed wherever the officer
 
05:03:18.670 --> 05:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
puts fixes it to the vehicle and it may
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
or may not be an appropriate place for
 
05:03:25.350 --> 05:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
the owner to like where it was
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
put thank you representative a thank you
 
05:03:30.948 --> 05:03:30.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:03:33.030 --> 05:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
question what are the ethics behind
 
05:03:36.350 --> 05:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
putting an original Vin tag on a on a
 
05:03:38.750 --> 05:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
body part that's been substantially
 
05:03:41.270 --> 05:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
repaired if you you had to make a
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
major patch for the for the part it's no
 
05:03:47.310 --> 05:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
longer original what how's that viewed
 
05:03:50.310 --> 05:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
by anti- car collectors and and the
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
marketplace well you you you you're
 
05:03:54.270 --> 05:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
repairing that section of the car that
 
05:03:56.230 --> 05:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
contains that bin plate I mean if it's
 
05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
just a like on the GM cars the uh the
 
05:04:00.430 --> 05:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
driver's sight pill or if that got
 
05:04:02.670 --> 05:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
smashed or if it got rusted and they put
 
05:04:06.868 --> 05:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
in a new a new piece on there a new you
 
05:04:09.830 --> 05:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
know section of that car to repair it
 
05:04:11.708 --> 05:04:11.718 align:start position:0%
the uh the the new piece does not have
 
05:04:14.708 --> 05:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
any numbers on it if you buy an a pillar
 
05:04:17.990 --> 05:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
for instance or if you're buying the
 
05:04:22.910 --> 05:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
cowl the the dashboard or the um the
 
05:04:25.670 --> 05:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
firewall um it just you're basically
 
05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
you're repairing that same car of course
 
05:04:29.910 --> 05:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
you don't want to take the vent plate
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
off of one car and put it on another
 
05:04:33.670 --> 05:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's not ethical at all but you want
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain the VIN number
 
05:04:39.230 --> 05:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
for that same car that you're restoring
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
because a lot of these car
 
05:04:44.510 --> 05:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
enthusiasts they the VIN number will
 
05:04:47.270 --> 05:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
tell you whether it's an SS whether it's
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
a a a real GTO or not just a tempest or
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
it you know it it has these certain
 
05:04:56.708 --> 05:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
options this type of motor or whatever
 
05:04:58.430 --> 05:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
and they like to be able to have their
 
05:05:01.708 --> 05:05:01.718 align:start position:0%
car continue to be matching to the rest
 
05:05:04.510 --> 05:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
of the car when they restore it these uh
 
05:05:07.868 --> 05:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
car rest restores they uh they go right
 
05:05:09.868 --> 05:05:09.878 align:start position:0%
into these details that most other
 
05:05:11.628 --> 05:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
people don't even think
 
05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
about representative Hill thank you Mr
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
question I think I'm following up on um
 
05:05:20.190 --> 05:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
representative V's
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
question would it are you envisioning
 
05:05:24.750 --> 05:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
some type of a disclosure that would
 
05:05:27.030 --> 05:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
have to follow the car um like you would
 
05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
do with a odometer change or something
 
05:05:32.708 --> 05:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
like that because it seems to me if you
 
05:05:35.868 --> 05:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership without disclosing
 
05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
that you have removed this tag and
 
05:05:41.670 --> 05:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
returned the same tag on there that
 
05:05:44.190 --> 05:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
someone down the line could get in
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
difficulty with a Eagle Eye officer as
 
05:05:49.150 --> 05:05:49.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying I mean it it would seem to
 
05:05:51.628 --> 05:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
me you'd need to have some kind of chain
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
or paperwork that would say this has
 
05:05:57.150 --> 05:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
been removed at some point and replaced
 
05:05:58.670 --> 05:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that that that would not be a
 
05:06:00.270 --> 05:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
problem if there was some kind of an
 
05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
official uh declaration or an affidavit
 
05:06:05.350 --> 05:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
or something like that to go along with
 
05:06:07.230 --> 05:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
the car I would be before
 
05:06:11.310 --> 05:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
that well um additionally I know when
 
05:06:13.948 --> 05:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
you homemade trailers or something like
 
05:06:16.708 --> 05:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
that you need to have someone come and
 
05:06:20.190 --> 05:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
view uh you know the the local police
 
05:06:22.628 --> 05:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
officer will come and and view that
 
05:06:24.990 --> 05:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
there is no or certify that there is no
 
05:06:27.990 --> 05:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
VIN number and and you end up with that
 
05:06:30.510 --> 05:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh sticker somewhere along the line
 
05:06:32.750 --> 05:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
would something like that help your
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
situation that all that someone would
 
05:06:36.990 --> 05:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
come and certify that the VIN number
 
05:06:40.070 --> 05:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
plate had been removed and and well that
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
CH basically changes the VIN number of
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
the car and it it changes its ientity
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
and its and its
 
05:06:52.310 --> 05:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
um I guess you know it's Prestige among
 
05:06:55.190 --> 05:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
the among the the car collector because
 
05:06:56.990 --> 05:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of times those that that VIN
 
05:06:59.150 --> 05:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
number denotes that whether or not that
 
05:07:02.270 --> 05:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
was a real super sport whether it really
 
05:07:05.628 --> 05:07:05.638 align:start position:0%
came equipped with a 327 or was it a 283
 
05:07:08.310 --> 05:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
car or was it a six-cylinder car whether
 
05:07:11.150 --> 05:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
or not it uh had you know had a certain
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
option package or something like that
 
05:07:15.510 --> 05:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I think what that would do if you
 
05:07:17.548 --> 05:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
had a state issued event it would
 
05:07:20.070 --> 05:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
devalue the car as far as the car
 
05:07:22.070 --> 05:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
collector is
 
05:07:25.110 --> 05:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
concerned Paul thank you I I don't think
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
I'm saying I'm changing the VIN number
 
05:07:31.110 --> 05:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
just just the fact that it was the plate
 
05:07:34.150 --> 05:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
was removed while you repaired that and
 
05:07:37.390 --> 05:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
then the plate is being put back on so
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't look like the original
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
rivet or something like that I would
 
05:07:46.030 --> 05:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
that not solve your issue if there was a
 
05:07:47.708 --> 05:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
um if there was like you mean like a a
 
05:07:50.310 --> 05:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
certificate that went with the car there
 
05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
you go that that that I wouldn't have an
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
issue with that okay if that yeah
 
05:07:57.270 --> 05:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative frat yes thank you Mr
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
chair um following on this
 
05:08:04.470 --> 05:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
discussion uh I'm not sure that I
 
05:08:07.708 --> 05:08:07.718 align:start position:0%
understand exactly what the interest of
 
05:08:10.310 --> 05:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire is
 
05:08:11.628 --> 05:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
in this
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
process um clearly a title is not
 
05:08:18.990 --> 05:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
required for a vehicle that old and in
 
05:08:21.430 --> 05:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
your mind what would
 
05:08:25.548 --> 05:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
differentiate uh a 52 Chevy Corvette
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
from an 1890 Lin dresser which is also
 
05:08:29.160 --> 05:08:31.310 align:start position:0%
from an 1890 Lin dresser which is also
an

05:08:31.310 --> 05:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:08:31.320 --> 05:08:33.548 align:start position:0%
an
antique

05:08:33.548 --> 05:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
antique
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
well okay you it had two different
 
05:08:39.708 --> 05:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
questions here I I kind of lost um
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
I lost my train of thought on the first
 
05:08:43.830 --> 05:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
part of
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
that uh the first part of the question
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
is what exactly is the interest of the
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire because a title
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
is not required for a vehicle I believe
 
05:08:59.548 --> 05:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
25 years or
 
05:09:03.390 --> 05:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
older okay um I got got that part the
 
05:09:05.670 --> 05:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire allows a person
 
05:09:09.390 --> 05:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
to obtain an antique vehicle title for
 
05:09:12.510 --> 05:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
Vehicles over 25 years of age it's an
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
option for the for the vehicle owner and
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
it also helps when selling that vehicle
 
05:09:22.110 --> 05:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
to um people out of
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
state and the state's interest is
 
05:09:28.070 --> 05:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
that right now it's a crime to just
 
05:09:28.080 --> 05:09:29.070 align:start position:0%
that right now it's a crime to just
remove

05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
remove
 
05:09:33.430 --> 05:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
it to remove that VIN for any
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
reason and what what this bill would do
 
05:09:40.110 --> 05:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
is it would eliminate that potential
 
05:09:40.120 --> 05:09:43.110 align:start position:0%
is it would eliminate that potential
criminal

05:09:43.110 --> 05:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
offense the second part of the question
 
05:09:48.030 --> 05:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
the second part of the question is um
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
again what differentiates a antique 52
 
05:09:56.590 --> 05:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
chevy from a an 1840 Len dresser which
 
05:10:00.270 --> 05:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
also has antique value and if you're a
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
collector you want to know that what
 
05:10:06.830 --> 05:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:10.030 --> 05:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
article well the VIN number for for a 52
 
05:10:13.548 --> 05:10:13.558 align:start position:0%
chevy would have a standard format for a
 
05:10:16.548 --> 05:10:16.558 align:start position:0%
52 chevy and and the other uh vehicle
 
05:10:19.788 --> 05:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
I'm which I have no idea um I'm not
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with it um piece of furniture
 
05:10:25.390 --> 05:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
it's a piece of oh a piece of furniture
 
05:10:28.190 --> 05:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
it probably wouldn't have an A number
 
05:10:29.910 --> 05:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
that even closely resembles that of a
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
car I I'm not exactly sure how to answer
 
05:10:33.750 --> 05:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
that question that's kind of to me
 
05:10:35.548 --> 05:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
sounds like an apples and
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
oranges type of question when I'm trying
 
05:10:40.548 --> 05:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
to compare you know two different things
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
there okay we'll let it go with that
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:10:45.868 --> 05:10:45.878 align:start position:0%
representative any other questions from
 
05:10:45.878 --> 05:10:46.910 align:start position:0%

o from the DMV who's requesting uh five
 
05:11:01.628 --> 05:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
minutes welcome to
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
Transportation good afternoon committee
 
05:11:05.110 --> 05:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
members thank you for taking the time to
 
05:11:07.150 --> 05:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
hear me today my name is Jennifer o and
 
05:11:08.750 --> 05:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the title bureau administrator with
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
the division of Motor Vehicles I've been
 
05:11:12.910 --> 05:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
with the division for 22 years with a
 
05:11:15.230 --> 05:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
main focus in both registration and
 
05:11:17.350 --> 05:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
titling of vehicles I've heard your
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
questions today along with the testimony
 
05:11:21.070 --> 05:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill and I just wanted to
 
05:11:22.990 --> 05:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
provide some information and take any
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions you may have regarding this so
 
05:11:29.190 --> 05:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
when a vehicle whether it be antique or
 
05:11:32.310 --> 05:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
title required has a VIN removed and
 
05:11:34.670 --> 05:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
different major component parts added to
 
05:11:36.750 --> 05:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
it from a vehicle that bears a different
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
Vin this would be what we consider an
 
05:11:41.470 --> 05:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
assembled vehicle we would need to see
 
05:11:43.868 --> 05:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
all documentation pertaining to all
 
05:11:45.868 --> 05:11:45.878 align:start position:0%
vehicles with major component parts
 
05:11:47.948 --> 05:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
pertaining to vins regardless of the
 
05:11:50.350 --> 05:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
year of manufacturer and then we as the
 
05:11:51.948 --> 05:11:51.958 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire through our state
 
05:11:54.030 --> 05:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
police members would assign a New
 
05:11:56.110 --> 05:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire issued Vin whether it be
 
05:11:59.788 --> 05:11:59.798 align:start position:0%
titled or not if we have if we are
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill in a sense where we
 
05:12:04.990 --> 05:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
are going to remove a plate restore
 
05:12:07.350 --> 05:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
refinish and then put that plate exactly
 
05:12:08.708 --> 05:12:08.718 align:start position:0%
back on and we're not taking major
 
05:12:10.830 --> 05:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
component parts from any other VIN
 
05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
numbers then that I think would be a
 
05:12:13.948 --> 05:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
different story and I think there were a
 
05:12:15.590 --> 05:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
couple questions pertaining both of
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
those scenarios so I'll just open that
 
05:12:20.350 --> 05:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
up to you guys if you have any
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
05:12:22.320 --> 05:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
the

05:12:23.350 --> 05:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:12:26.948 --> 05:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
committee representative syes thank you
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
so you
 
05:12:31.350 --> 05:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
just in my mind at least you opened up a
 
05:12:33.390 --> 05:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
can of worms which I appreciate because
 
05:12:35.830 --> 05:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
I was wondering about this there's
 
05:12:37.868 --> 05:12:37.878 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill as it's currently
 
05:12:40.030 --> 05:12:40.040 align:start position:0%
written that would be
 
05:12:42.110 --> 05:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
that would differentiate between those
 
05:12:43.910 --> 05:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
two different scenarios that you just
 
05:12:47.230 --> 05:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
described that is correct and and do you
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
does the New Hampshire
 
05:12:52.670 --> 05:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
DMV is that is that a problem for the
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire DMV title bureau with the
 
05:12:56.590 --> 05:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
language that's in the bill that's
 
05:12:58.150 --> 05:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
written as is
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
today it is represented that the VIN
 
05:13:04.030 --> 05:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
there would be no penalty if the VIN was
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
removed for restoration and then
 
05:13:09.750 --> 05:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
replaced not the VIN taken off of this
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle that I have sitting here that I
 
05:13:13.310 --> 05:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
want to restore well I've taken a
 
05:13:15.628 --> 05:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
chassis that is in much better condition
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
than the one that I have the chassi is
 
05:13:19.868 --> 05:13:19.878 align:start position:0%
actually uh one of the major component
 
05:13:21.470 --> 05:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
parts that has a VIN from another
 
05:13:24.310 --> 05:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle so when we talk about the VIN
 
05:13:26.670 --> 05:13:26.680 align:start position:0%
describing where it was made when it was
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
made what the model is there is value
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
added to that and that is what
 
05:13:33.350 --> 05:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
collectors want to see in the vehicle
 
05:13:35.948 --> 05:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
but in our eyes when you're meshing
 
05:13:37.868 --> 05:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
multiple vehicles with multiple vins
 
05:13:40.150 --> 05:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
together there is a process that we go
 
05:13:42.390 --> 05:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
through what we don't want to see is we
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
don't want to see a VIN number for a
 
05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
frame that's attached to John's vehicle
 
05:13:50.670 --> 05:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
while that VIN plate on the public
 
05:13:52.910 --> 05:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
dashboard is taken off and placed onto
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
another vehicle that opens up for fraud
 
05:13:58.030 --> 05:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
and what we see there is masking of
 
05:14:00.590 --> 05:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles we see this going across the
 
05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
entire United States we have these
 
05:14:05.230 --> 05:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
checks and balances put in place that if
 
05:14:07.070 --> 05:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to take multiple vins and
 
05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
merge into one vehicle which we see all
 
05:14:11.230 --> 05:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
the time we are going to assign a New
 
05:14:13.230 --> 05:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Vin and we are actually going
 
05:14:16.390 --> 05:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
to merge those used vins into that so
 
05:14:19.390 --> 05:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
that if another Vin plate is taken and
 
05:14:21.868 --> 05:14:21.878 align:start position:0%
it's part of your chassis it's not going
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:31.350 --> 05:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
fraud representative Hill so I'm hearing
 
05:14:34.350 --> 05:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I'm
 
05:14:39.548 --> 05:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
hearing that you don't have a problem
 
05:14:41.350 --> 05:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
I think what you're saying is what
 
05:14:42.750 --> 05:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
they're asking
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
for there currently isn't a problem
 
05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
with removing the penalty for just
 
05:14:51.628 --> 05:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
removing the VIN and replacing it right
 
05:14:53.708 --> 05:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
back on the same vehicle would be on the
 
05:14:55.590 --> 05:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement side that would not have
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
anything to do with our process at the
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
division uh however uh there was a
 
05:15:02.470 --> 05:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
statement that was made in the testimony
 
05:15:04.110 --> 05:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
that talked about taking a chassis from
 
05:15:05.788 --> 05:15:05.798 align:start position:0%
another vehicle as part of the
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
restoration and that's what would open
 
05:15:10.230 --> 05:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
up um some issues on our with the
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork follow follow up follow thank
 
05:15:15.910 --> 05:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
you but that's not what the bill is
 
05:15:18.548 --> 05:15:18.558 align:start position:0%
talking about that second scenario your
 
05:15:21.270 --> 05:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
your your objection is to the testimony
 
05:15:23.070 --> 05:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about I'm providing
 
05:15:24.990 --> 05:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
information on the testimony yes it
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
sounds to me and maybe I'm wrong but it
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like if you spoke with the
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and uh the gentleman that
 
05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
testified it sounds like what they want
 
05:15:38.110 --> 05:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
to do is already available to be able to
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
no the what what they're asking to do
 
05:15:48.270 --> 05:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
just in this bin yeah if it isn't in
 
05:15:50.830 --> 05:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the testimony provided
 
05:15:52.548 --> 05:15:52.558 align:start position:0%
they would need the verbiage in here
 
05:15:54.270 --> 05:15:54.280 align:start position:0%
because it is current they are correct
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
that if you remove a VIN regardless if
 
05:15:58.548 --> 05:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
you're replacing it for whatever reason
 
05:16:00.708 --> 05:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
it is part of the penalty got it thank
 
05:16:02.270 --> 05:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
you you're
 
05:16:05.390 --> 05:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
welcome representative a thank you Mr
 
05:16:06.390 --> 05:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:16:09.430 --> 05:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
question um so
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
the scenario if you you have a rusted
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
out uh Fender and you take the tag off
 
05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
from inside the fender and you repair
 
05:16:21.150 --> 05:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
that that area you weld in a new piece
 
05:16:24.030 --> 05:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
of Steel and you you is it okay to put
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
that tag back on right that's not legal
 
05:16:26.840 --> 05:16:27.788 align:start position:0%
that tag back on right that's not legal
right

05:16:27.788 --> 05:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
now um no if if that sounds like that's
 
05:16:33.628 --> 05:16:33.638 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to achieve for
 
05:16:37.350 --> 05:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
models 81 or older in this language that
 
05:16:40.628 --> 05:16:40.638 align:start position:0%
that scenario yeah I guess it's more of
 
05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
a question followup follow more of a
 
05:16:45.830 --> 05:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
question for collector or an offici AO
 
05:16:47.590 --> 05:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
to how would that be perceived in the
 
05:16:49.510 --> 05:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
marketplace if you know it's the same
 
05:16:51.230 --> 05:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
Fender but it was repaired and the tag
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
put back on what that I I would not be
 
05:16:56.590 --> 05:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
able to provide that thank you
 
05:16:58.230 --> 05:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative Martin uh thank you Mr
 
05:17:00.310 --> 05:17:00.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh and thank you for appearing
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh it surprises me there is not more
 
05:17:04.990 --> 05:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
detailed federal law in this area are we
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
sure that we're not stepping on anything
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
Federal when we do this that is a
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
fantastic question uh we can reference
 
05:17:17.548 --> 05:17:17.558 align:start position:0%
CFR our 49 CFR uh to see if this would
 
05:17:20.708 --> 05:17:20.718 align:start position:0%
be um in violation of that I know that
 
05:17:21.990 --> 05:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
these are our New Hampshire enforcement
 
05:17:24.270 --> 05:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
laws right
 
05:17:26.350 --> 05:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
now representative
 
05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
patero thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you mentioned
 
05:17:33.670 --> 05:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
briefly the concept of an assembled
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle can you um explain in more
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
detail like what that is and like what
 
05:17:42.150 --> 05:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
to expect with the state giving a new
 
05:17:43.830 --> 05:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
vin to an assembled vehicle yeah
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely that's a great question thank
 
05:17:48.708 --> 05:17:48.718 align:start position:0%
you so if I take my
 
05:17:52.628 --> 05:17:52.638 align:start position:0%
1996 Honda Accord um it does not require
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
a title but it has a valid issued Vin
 
05:18:00.150 --> 05:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
and I take the frame of a 1990 Honda
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
Accord and uh remodel the vehicle
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
whether it be due to damage whatever
 
05:18:08.350 --> 05:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
it's what I could find at the scrapyard
 
05:18:11.110 --> 05:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
the size matches there are going to be
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
VIN numbers issued to both of those
 
05:18:15.948 --> 05:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
Vehicles both of those Vehicles will
 
05:18:18.030 --> 05:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
have chain of transfer right transfer of
 
05:18:19.708 --> 05:18:19.718 align:start position:0%
ownership that you're going to
 
05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
see the issue becomes that where these
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
VIN numbers are placed on different
 
05:18:27.190 --> 05:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
component parts and now these vehicles
 
05:18:29.830 --> 05:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
are essentially being parted out and put
 
05:18:32.628 --> 05:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
together we need to create one single
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
VIN number and essentially kill off the
 
05:18:37.590 --> 05:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
other bin numbers so that those aren't
 
05:18:39.470 --> 05:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
being used fraudulently
 
05:18:42.628 --> 05:18:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:46.110 --> 05:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
world representative Fox thank you Mr
 
05:18:48.430 --> 05:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:18:50.230 --> 05:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
question and this is kind of
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
hypothetical because I'm not versed on
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
antique cars at all but I know the VIN
 
05:18:58.670 --> 05:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
number in my vehicle now is on a plate
 
05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
on the dash if I were to own an ant a
 
05:19:04.548 --> 05:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
vehicle older than
 
05:19:09.548 --> 05:19:09.558 align:start position:0%
1981 with the VIN number there let's say
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
hypothetically and I needed to replace
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
that dash for some reason I wanted to
 
05:19:17.590 --> 05:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
remove the the VIN number put a new Dash
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
in replace the VIN
 
05:19:23.830 --> 05:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
number under the law current law I can't
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
do that that is correct under the new
 
05:19:30.430 --> 05:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
law I would be able to do that that is
 
05:19:33.070 --> 05:19:33.080 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
05:19:35.000 --> 05:19:36.430 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
committee

05:19:36.430 --> 05:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:19:39.150 --> 05:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
nope not seeing any thank you so thank
 
05:19:41.470 --> 05:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
you for your time and with that I have
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
nobody else um on the docket so at this
 
05:19:45.390 --> 05:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
point I'm going to close the public
 
05:19:47.948 --> 05:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
298 our next bill would be HB 326 we'll
 
05:20:35.590 --> 05:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:35.600 --> 05:20:55.390 align:start position:0%
 
our

05:20:55.390 --> 05:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
good to see you I'm sorry you didn't ask
 
05:21:00.788 --> 05:21:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:12.558 --> 05:21:45.430 align:start position:0%
 
that's

05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:48.390 --> 05:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
okay it's 3:22 I am going to open up the
 
05:21:51.150 --> 05:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
326 which is prohibiting the operation
 
05:21:56.948 --> 05:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
of antique passenger vehicles model year
 
05:22:00.990 --> 05:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
1968 or older on state or or local
 
05:22:03.628 --> 05:22:03.638 align:start position:0%
highways for more than 20 miles unless
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is fitted or retrofitted
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
with seat or safety belts
 
05:22:12.510 --> 05:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
at this point i' like to chair like to
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
call up representative Tim haran yes
 
05:22:17.990 --> 05:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill welcome
 
05:22:30.230 --> 05:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation I'm I'm resident Timothy
 
05:22:34.150 --> 05:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
Horan from straford County District 10
 
05:22:37.390 --> 05:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham and um I subed here
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
several times the last session so many
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
so like uh one person asked me oh are
 
05:22:45.150 --> 05:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
you on transportation again I said like
 
05:22:47.948 --> 05:22:47.958 align:start position:0%
no I was on Judiciary but uh and this
 
05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
bill um it was a suggestion from a
 
05:22:52.030 --> 05:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
friend of mine whose brother was killed
 
05:22:55.670 --> 05:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
in a in an accident and I think probably
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh uh I I've seem to I I think the
 
05:23:01.390 --> 05:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
anti-ar collecting Community doesn't
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
like the bill as as written and um so
 
05:23:05.670 --> 05:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's uh I just have to acknowledge
 
05:23:08.590 --> 05:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
that up front and they're compared to
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of the other uh other lobbies have
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
inspired the IR of um I feel a little
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
bit bad about that because they're very
 
05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
they all seem to be very nice and
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
cheerful people so unlike some others
 
05:23:20.150 --> 05:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
I've inspired the IR of but anyway I'll
 
05:23:20.160 --> 05:23:21.390 align:start position:0%
I've inspired the IR of but anyway I'll
start

05:23:21.390 --> 05:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
start
 
05:23:23.708 --> 05:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
um so first off the first piece of
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
testimony here which was uh which was
 
05:23:29.070 --> 05:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
from a friend
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
who uh suggested it to me it was uh Kate
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
Miller from Meredith who's actually a
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
former State Rep served uh from 200 9 to
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
2010 and um her brother was an antique
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
car ficado so I guess I'll read her
 
05:23:45.670 --> 05:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
statement it would probably be much
 
05:23:47.548 --> 05:23:47.558 align:start position:0%
better if if she was here she's a much
 
05:23:49.150 --> 05:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
better speaker much better writer than
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
me but anyway she says my brother John
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
Warner IV was an antique car and
 
05:23:55.868 --> 05:23:55.878 align:start position:0%
airplane defishing AO he maintained a
 
05:23:57.868 --> 05:23:57.878 align:start position:0%
garage in Melbourne Village which is a
 
05:23:59.708 --> 05:23:59.718 align:start position:0%
gathering spot for fellow old car
 
05:24:01.750 --> 05:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
junkies to trade advice and tell tall
 
05:24:04.430 --> 05:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
stories um something she didn't add to
 
05:24:05.910 --> 05:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
was that the name of his garage was
 
05:24:07.990 --> 05:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
actually the Melvin garage so that was
 
05:24:10.470 --> 05:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
but on a particularly sparkling New
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire day two years ago in June John
 
05:24:13.868 --> 05:24:13.878 align:start position:0%
decided a quick errand would be the most
 
05:24:16.590 --> 05:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
fun if taken in one of his antiques with
 
05:24:19.230 --> 05:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
the top down not far down the road we
 
05:24:21.110 --> 05:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
presume he saw an oncoming car drifting
 
05:24:23.270 --> 05:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
across a center line that driver post
 
05:24:25.510 --> 05:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
accident recalls hearing a horn and then
 
05:24:27.708 --> 05:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
seeing a white light that light
 
05:24:29.788 --> 05:24:29.798 align:start position:0%
apparently was the impact of my car
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
hitting my brother's vehicle with enough
 
05:24:33.868 --> 05:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
force that he was ejected killing him on
 
05:24:35.190 --> 05:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
on upon
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
impact this fanciful anti car neither
 
05:24:39.990 --> 05:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
seat belt nor automatic steering nor
 
05:24:42.350 --> 05:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
brakes and yet it was legally registered
 
05:24:43.628 --> 05:24:43.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire since it was in the
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
antique category if New Hampshire
 
05:24:47.750 --> 05:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
require seat belts for all individuals
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
under a certain age parenthetically I
 
05:24:52.310 --> 05:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
believe that's 18 why does it not in
 
05:24:55.070 --> 05:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles in vehicles over certain age
 
05:24:56.788 --> 05:24:56.798 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the statistics are low for
 
05:24:58.868 --> 05:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
access in category but they're not low
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
in my family so and then um my testimony
 
05:25:04.750 --> 05:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
which I put on the portal but I don't
 
05:25:07.150 --> 05:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
think I have emailed to you um and maybe
 
05:25:09.470 --> 05:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'll uh this bills inspired the death of
 
05:25:11.150 --> 05:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
a wonderful man who dialed suddenly much
 
05:25:12.750 --> 05:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
too soon a car crash near his home in
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
Melvin Village two years ago John Warner
 
05:25:18.310 --> 05:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
IV um his obituary sites a very specific
 
05:25:22.030 --> 05:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
time 1:44 p.m. June 12 2023 he was
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
driving one of his many treasured
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
antique Vehicles when he died on an
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise ordinary Monday afternoon I
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
mean it was sparkling but
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
ordinary the old car did have a horn and
 
05:25:34.190 --> 05:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
he was able to honk it before the other
 
05:25:35.948 --> 05:25:35.958 align:start position:0%
driver hit him but it lacked a number of
 
05:25:37.868 --> 05:25:37.878 align:start position:0%
other modern safety features including
 
05:25:41.190 --> 05:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
seat belts the accident likely would
 
05:25:42.390 --> 05:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
have been a minor one if he'd been
 
05:25:44.788 --> 05:25:44.798 align:start position:0%
wearing a seat belt I guess not everyone
 
05:25:46.030 --> 05:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
behind me is going to agree with that
 
05:25:48.708 --> 05:25:48.718 align:start position:0%
but um but it became a tragedy I'm
 
05:25:50.230 --> 05:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill because I don't
 
05:25:51.628 --> 05:25:51.638 align:start position:0%
want any other families to go through
 
05:25:53.230 --> 05:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
what John Warner's family is going
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
through since 20123 and um he did um he
 
05:26:00.510 --> 05:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
did many great things in his hometown of
 
05:26:03.030 --> 05:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
Clinton Illinois about 160 Mi south of
 
05:26:04.868 --> 05:26:04.878 align:start position:0%
Chicago in New Hampshire's Lake Region
 
05:26:06.310 --> 05:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
and elsewhere so here in New Hampshire
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
is probably best known for leadership
 
05:26:09.990 --> 05:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
role at the W Museum of World War II at
 
05:26:12.830 --> 05:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
Wolf Baro which I place I'm sure many of
 
05:26:14.510 --> 05:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
you visited um Everybody in the room
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
should visit that place it's a one of
 
05:26:18.030 --> 05:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
the most interesting museums in New
 
05:26:19.548 --> 05:26:19.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so he took a keen interest in
 
05:26:22.230 --> 05:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
the vehicles articles and other items on
 
05:26:25.708 --> 05:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
displ museum I know him uh better as the
 
05:26:27.628 --> 05:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
brother a former State represent Kate
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
Miller John didn't always wear a seat
 
05:26:32.670 --> 05:26:32.680 align:start position:0%
belt U but his sister always wears her
 
05:26:33.910 --> 05:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
even though she lives in New Hampshire
 
05:26:35.948 --> 05:26:35.958 align:start position:0%
where seat belts are optional this bill
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
was based on her suggestions so my
 
05:26:41.868 --> 05:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
original idea was to ban all pre 1968 SE
 
05:26:43.670 --> 05:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
seat BS cars in the highway but that
 
05:26:46.390 --> 05:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
that's obviously extremely excessive and
 
05:26:51.628 --> 05:26:51.638 align:start position:0%
um in theory um 1968 that was the 1967
 
05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
model year when the federal law was
 
05:26:56.948 --> 05:26:56.958 align:start position:0%
passed making C belts mandatory um they
 
05:26:59.350 --> 05:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
and I think there aren't any cars post
 
05:27:02.030 --> 05:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
1968 which lacked seat belts unless you
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
know some strange thing happened so and
 
05:27:07.548 --> 05:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
and uh seat belts they were not they're
 
05:27:09.750 --> 05:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
fairly common place even before the 1968
 
05:27:11.590 --> 05:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
model year and the now standard
 
05:27:13.390 --> 05:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
retractable three-point shoulder belt
 
05:27:14.830 --> 05:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
which we all have in our cars and
 
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully everybody in the room actually
 
05:27:20.310 --> 05:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
uses theirs um that was invented in 1959
 
05:27:22.390 --> 05:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
by a Volvo engineer named Neils Boland
 
05:27:25.708 --> 05:27:25.718 align:start position:0%
in 19659 and quickly spread worldwide
 
05:27:25.718 --> 05:27:26.750 align:start position:0%
in 19659 and quickly spread worldwide
and

05:27:26.750 --> 05:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:28.990 --> 05:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
um then I have like a little paragraph
 
05:27:31.150 --> 05:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
here I'll skip over about my dad's 1963
 
05:27:34.110 --> 05:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
Ford Falcon which uh had front lap belts
 
05:27:35.670 --> 05:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
as standard equipment you can actually
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
still get seat belts and then my mother
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
is having aftermarket lap belts
 
05:27:41.830 --> 05:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
installed in the back anyway it's a very
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
short de detail Bill the details of
 
05:27:47.350 --> 05:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
implementing might well obviously we
 
05:27:48.830 --> 05:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
need a lot more detail than what is
 
05:27:51.470 --> 05:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
shown here and that was why I asked to
 
05:27:54.350 --> 05:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
give the do rulemaking Authority and
 
05:27:59.708 --> 05:27:59.718 align:start position:0%
probably um there is um well I'm um be
 
05:28:01.628 --> 05:28:01.638 align:start position:0%
pleasantly surprised if this idea goes
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
too far but like uh there are other
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
states that have laws in that California
 
05:28:08.548 --> 05:28:08.558 align:start position:0%
is a very extensive one which uh
 
05:28:10.750 --> 05:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
anyway so anyway whatever you do at this
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill I hasten to add that even if you do
 
05:28:15.310 --> 05:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
pass it um it merely changes
 
05:28:18.628 --> 05:28:18.638 align:start position:0%
requirements for making pre-1968 cars um
 
05:28:21.390 --> 05:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
you know from before the 1967 from the
 
05:28:25.430 --> 05:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
1966 model year and older um street
 
05:28:27.830 --> 05:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
legal doesn't change our existing laws
 
05:28:29.708 --> 05:28:29.718 align:start position:0%
about wearing seat belts if you are an
 
05:28:32.590 --> 05:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
adult you still wouldn't be actually
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
legally required to wear your car's seat
 
05:28:36.910 --> 05:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
belt no matter how old the car is and
 
05:28:39.830 --> 05:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm guess I'll also say at the end this
 
05:28:41.590 --> 05:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
is this is probably a difficult year to
 
05:28:43.390 --> 05:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
be introducing any seat belt bill you
 
05:28:45.548 --> 05:28:45.558 align:start position:0%
know even though um even when we had
 
05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
this baate of accidents in I95 uh the
 
05:28:50.350 --> 05:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
former Governor you know said they're
 
05:28:51.910 --> 05:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to en Force the laws on distracted
 
05:28:54.270 --> 05:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
driving and U well we don't have a state
 
05:28:56.070 --> 05:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
seat Bel law so they couldn't enforce a
 
05:28:58.110 --> 05:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
non-existent law but like he didn't even
 
05:29:01.830 --> 05:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
urge people to buckle up but um
 
05:29:04.310 --> 05:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
so so anyway that that's the bill I
 
05:29:05.830 --> 05:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
think there's a good idea there I
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
certainly my ideal preference would be
 
05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
have the committee retained it and work
 
05:29:11.628 --> 05:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
it because I probably need more than
 
05:29:15.190 --> 05:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
just the 20 miles unless you're going to
 
05:29:18.750 --> 05:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
a parade or a car show so even if so you
 
05:29:21.590 --> 05:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to accommodate uh anti- car
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
collectors uh you probably would need
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
you probably need more exceptions of
 
05:29:30.590 --> 05:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill and um so that uh
 
05:29:32.750 --> 05:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's my bill and former
 
05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
representative Miller's testimony and
 
05:29:36.150 --> 05:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
wish she would have been better if she
 
05:29:37.270 --> 05:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
was there she would have delivered it
 
05:29:39.270 --> 05:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
much better than I did but so I'm happy
 
05:29:41.708 --> 05:29:41.718 align:start position:0%
to take any questions any questions for
 
05:29:44.510 --> 05:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
the committee yeah representative G yeah
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have a question and a
 
05:29:47.948 --> 05:29:47.958 align:start position:0%
followup um thank you Mr chair so my
 
05:29:50.750 --> 05:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
initial question is yeah
 
05:29:53.310 --> 05:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of what this would do
 
05:29:55.548 --> 05:29:55.558 align:start position:0%
to the value of the of the vehicles that
 
05:29:57.030 --> 05:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
would be modified in terms of their
 
05:29:59.190 --> 05:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
collectibility and their appraisal
 
05:30:02.150 --> 05:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
initially and are you aware also that
 
05:30:04.510 --> 05:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
this would um trigger actually a
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
criminal action for people coming over
 
05:30:09.110 --> 05:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
the Border who do not have to face these
 
05:30:10.510 --> 05:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions as collectors were they
 
05:30:15.270 --> 05:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
coming to a car show u i I guess guess
 
05:30:17.030 --> 05:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
the law I mean the second thing that's
 
05:30:19.030 --> 05:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
something you could you could put if you
 
05:30:20.910 --> 05:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
like the bill except for that one thing
 
05:30:22.708 --> 05:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
um you could put an exception for
 
05:30:24.830 --> 05:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles registered from out of state
 
05:30:27.910 --> 05:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
and um so um looking at the wrong
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
looking at this other Bill let's
 
05:30:33.310 --> 05:30:33.320 align:start position:0%
see yeah it does refer to all antique
 
05:30:34.910 --> 05:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles regardless of where
 
05:30:36.788 --> 05:30:36.798 align:start position:0%
they're registered so that's U you know
 
05:30:38.430 --> 05:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
if you just want to change it definition
 
05:30:40.150 --> 05:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
of what a street legal vehicle is and
 
05:30:42.910 --> 05:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
tweak the definitions or create another
 
05:30:44.910 --> 05:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
class of antique Vehicles you could do
 
05:30:46.150 --> 05:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
that I think that's what they did in the
 
05:30:48.270 --> 05:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
California law although I haven't had a
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
chance to I looked at a few weeks ago
 
05:30:51.628 --> 05:30:51.638 align:start position:0%
but I Haven a chance to look at that so
 
05:30:51.638 --> 05:30:52.868 align:start position:0%
but I Haven a chance to look at that so
that's

05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:30:56.788 --> 05:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that's for the value that's
 
05:30:58.510 --> 05:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
decision you can make we did as I said
 
05:31:00.190 --> 05:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
we did put in least we already put in
 
05:31:02.070 --> 05:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
like some exceptions anyway so you don't
 
05:31:03.910 --> 05:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
have to if you don't want to put one in
 
05:31:07.350 --> 05:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
your car uh you you you don't have to I
 
05:31:08.310 --> 05:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
think the one involv bomed in the
 
05:31:11.110 --> 05:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
accident was a roadster from the 1940s
 
05:31:12.470 --> 05:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard from somebody else
 
05:31:14.190 --> 05:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
who seen the police report and that you
 
05:31:16.390 --> 05:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
know I don't know whether that would uh
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
I think probably some people did have
 
05:31:20.750 --> 05:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
crude seat belts back then but some
 
05:31:23.990 --> 05:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
didn't yes all yes and and don't get me
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
wrong I sympathize with these losses um
 
05:31:28.350 --> 05:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
individuals have the right to make these
 
05:31:30.548 --> 05:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
modifications should they so choose but
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
my followup is specifically to uh
 
05:31:34.548 --> 05:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
traffic enforcement without the police
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
going on a fishing Expedition when they
 
05:31:38.110 --> 05:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
pull somebody over they don't know how
 
05:31:39.628 --> 05:31:39.638 align:start position:0%
long you've been on a public roadway for
 
05:31:40.590 --> 05:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from where they're
 
05:31:43.670 --> 05:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to um to me I I believe that this
 
05:31:46.110 --> 05:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
would create a set of circumstances
 
05:31:47.708 --> 05:31:47.718 align:start position:0%
where you would have an expectation of
 
05:31:49.750 --> 05:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
the police to do um basically an
 
05:31:51.868 --> 05:31:51.878 align:start position:0%
unwarranted deep search how would this
 
05:31:55.470 --> 05:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
be enforced in your opinion um I that's
 
05:31:58.190 --> 05:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
probably a question you should either
 
05:32:00.230 --> 05:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
ask of someone else or you have a work
 
05:32:01.948 --> 05:32:01.958 align:start position:0%
session to get into that detail I
 
05:32:05.150 --> 05:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
believe this is um this is something
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
would probably be enforced you know at
 
05:32:09.910 --> 05:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
the time of at the time of registration
 
05:32:11.150 --> 05:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
so they have to add some sort of
 
05:32:13.070 --> 05:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
endorsement to the registration um
 
05:32:15.548 --> 05:32:15.558 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's one of the many issues
 
05:32:18.310 --> 05:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
why we gave dot rulemaking Authority in
 
05:32:20.390 --> 05:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
this bill to hash out those details or
 
05:32:22.830 --> 05:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
you can try to Hash them out in a work
 
05:32:25.230 --> 05:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
session or even the retain Bill during
 
05:32:27.430 --> 05:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
the summer should you should you want to
 
05:32:30.750 --> 05:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
pursue this idea at all so any other
 
05:32:32.070 --> 05:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:32:36.350 --> 05:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
05:32:39.270 --> 05:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
much and uh chair would now like to

important concern of any antique owner
 
05:34:56.990 --> 05:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
and Driver we know seat belts provide a

the passenger of modern
 
05:35:04.150 --> 05:35:04.160 align:start position:0%

05:35:06.948 --> 05:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
any data indicating seat belts or other
 
05:35:08.788 --> 05:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
Technologies are needed to lower the

05:35:19.230 --> 05:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
antique owners have added turn signals
 
05:35:20.910 --> 05:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
improved lights and other safety
 
05:35:24.548 --> 05:35:24.558 align:start position:0%
features which include seat belts uh to
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
their vehicles these features when
 
05:35:29.230 --> 05:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
present have been added at the will of
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
the owner and not because of unnecessary
 
05:35:36.868 --> 05:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
regulation I'd like to take a couple
 
05:35:38.390 --> 05:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
minutes and
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
at the end here and just go over some
 
05:35:40.320 --> 05:35:41.350 align:start position:0%
at the end here and just go over some

technical
 
05:35:44.310 --> 05:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
issues uh and then I'll explain why we
 
05:35:47.390 --> 05:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
think HP 326 should not become
 
05:35:50.670 --> 05:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
law the early automobile industry relied
 
05:35:52.628 --> 05:35:52.638 align:start position:0%
heavily on Carriage or coach
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%

the fledgling automobile
 
05:36:00.788 --> 05:36:00.798 align:start position:0%

05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
primary structural

05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%

05:36:21.390 --> 05:36:21.400 align:start position:0%

the engineering would be correct and
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
consistent this will be a tall order for

a retroactive installation

happen Cas in point
 
05:37:11.190 --> 05:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
would be any of the open
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
cars okay next I'd like to address
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
cost designed and installed at the
 
05:37:18.910 --> 05:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
factory allowed the cost to be
 
05:37:20.910 --> 05:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
transferred to the buyer at a much lower
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
per unit cost than possible on a
 
05:37:23.840 --> 05:37:25.708 align:start position:0%
per unit cost than possible on a
one-of-a-kind

05:37:25.708 --> 05:37:25.718 align:start position:0%
one-of-a-kind
 
05:37:29.390 --> 05:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
basis retroactive installation will only
 
05:37:31.788 --> 05:37:31.798 align:start position:0%
work if the state cares to engineer and
 
05:37:34.430 --> 05:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
regulate the design and then inspect
 
05:37:36.110 --> 05:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
each installation to ensure its
 
05:37:36.120 --> 05:37:37.750 align:start position:0%
each installation to ensure its
compliance

05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
05:37:39.628 --> 05:37:39.638 align:start position:0%
surely there would have to be a fee for
 
05:37:41.628 --> 05:37:41.638 align:start position:0%
inspection added to the cost of the
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
Professional installation therefore
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
substantially increasing the financial
 
05:37:49.430 --> 05:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
burden to the
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
hobbyist lastly
 
05:37:55.628 --> 05:37:55.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement how would HB 326 be enforced
 
05:37:58.150 --> 05:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
would antique Autos be pulled over by
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to determine if the
 
05:38:02.270 --> 05:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
documents were wearing the seat
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
belts will only Autos registered
 
05:38:11.350 --> 05:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
after 19 68 uh or excuse me will only
 
05:38:13.390 --> 05:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
Autos registered as antique be the
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
Target or will officers be trained to
 
05:38:17.708 --> 05:38:17.718 align:start position:0%
recognize any registered vehicle older
 
05:38:17.718 --> 05:38:18.590 align:start position:0%
recognize any registered vehicle older
than

05:38:18.590 --> 05:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:38:21.070 --> 05:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
1968 so they won't inconvenience
 
05:38:23.310 --> 05:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
occupants of newer Vehicles who don't
 
05:38:25.868 --> 05:38:25.878 align:start position:0%
even have to wear their seat
 
05:38:28.548 --> 05:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
belts it's logical to assume that some
 
05:38:30.590 --> 05:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
type of inspection will be
 
05:38:32.708 --> 05:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
required to ensure the belts are
 
05:38:35.150 --> 05:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
installed correctly and who will train
 
05:38:38.190 --> 05:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
and designate those professionals
 
05:38:40.868 --> 05:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
to summarize I believe the antique
 
05:38:43.190 --> 05:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
automobile Community will agree that the
 
05:38:46.990 --> 05:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
HP 326 is technically deficient
 
05:38:47.000 --> 05:38:48.868 align:start position:0%
HP 326 is technically deficient
unenforceable

05:38:48.868 --> 05:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
unenforceable
 
05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
impracticable discriminating and
 
05:38:52.990 --> 05:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
needless reg
 
05:38:56.190 --> 05:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
regulation in fact it's likely that New
 
05:38:58.990 --> 05:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be the only state in the
 
05:39:01.788 --> 05:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
State of the Union that requires it I
 
05:39:04.948 --> 05:39:04.958 align:start position:0%
assume HB 326 was written without the
 
05:39:07.948 --> 05:39:07.958 align:start position:0%
aid of statistical data relevant to the
 
05:39:10.110 --> 05:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
frequency of traffic accidents involving
 
05:39:10.120 --> 05:39:11.030 align:start position:0%
frequency of traffic accidents involving
antique

05:39:11.030 --> 05:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
antique
 
05:39:13.390 --> 05:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
Autos so I can only
 
05:39:16.910 --> 05:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
conclude that law enforcement resources
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
and our tax dollars would be more useful
 
05:39:22.190 --> 05:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
if directed to more effective existing
 
05:39:24.310 --> 05:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
regulations and we know what they are
 
05:39:26.830 --> 05:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
the speed limits impaired and distracted
 
05:39:31.430 --> 05:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
drivers reckless driving Etc thank
 
05:39:33.948 --> 05:39:33.958 align:start position:0%
you any questions from the committee
 
05:39:36.750 --> 05:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative Peto thank you Mr chair
 
05:39:39.230 --> 05:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
05:39:43.070 --> 05:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
you mentioned um a situation where with
 
05:39:46.708 --> 05:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
these antique cars um the state doesn't
 
05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a requirement for certain um safety
 
05:39:51.788 --> 05:39:51.798 align:start position:0%
features you mentioned specifically turn
 
05:39:56.230 --> 05:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
signals as wondering if um if you could
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
expand a little bit on um how how the
 
05:40:03.070 --> 05:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
breakdown of of those regulations are
 
05:40:04.910 --> 05:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
whether they're purely Federal if it's
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
on a state-by-state basis I'm talking
 
05:40:10.468 --> 05:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
about like tail lights and turn signals
 
05:40:12.430 --> 05:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
like the third red brake light for
 
05:40:14.788 --> 05:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
example like like how is you as a Model
 
05:40:16.990 --> 05:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
A enthusias tackle those and make sure
 
05:40:20.270 --> 05:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
you're tackling it so everyone's
 
05:40:22.750 --> 05:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
satisfied I'm not sure I understand the
 
05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
the total uh scope of your question
 
05:40:30.548 --> 05:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
but dire turn signals or directional
 
05:40:31.910 --> 05:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
lights are a good
 
05:40:34.910 --> 05:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
example uh to to help answer NE your
 
05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
question there are uh equipment
 
05:40:42.190 --> 05:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
available for antique cars that can can
 
05:40:47.350 --> 05:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh provide that s uh feature and it it's
 
05:40:49.070 --> 05:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
easy to
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
install uh the companies will give you
 
05:40:54.750 --> 05:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
good directions we're even using uh LED
 
05:40:57.468 --> 05:40:57.478 align:start position:0%
lights now or bulbs and in tail lights
 
05:40:59.910 --> 05:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
and so forth all of those things can be
 
05:41:03.628 --> 05:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
done without remarkably changing the
 
05:41:05.990 --> 05:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
character of the vehicle and
 
05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
this uh speaks to the
 
05:41:12.430 --> 05:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
value they can be put on by a hobbyist
 
05:41:13.868 --> 05:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
without any
 
05:41:16.590 --> 05:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
problem there are actually there are
 
05:41:18.468 --> 05:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
seat belt kits
 
05:41:21.190 --> 05:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
available but interesting enough if you
 
05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
purchase one the there are no Specific
 
05:41:26.190 --> 05:41:26.200 align:start position:0%
Instructions how that should be
 
05:41:26.200 --> 05:41:27.788 align:start position:0%
Instructions how that should be
installed

05:41:27.788 --> 05:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
installed
 
05:41:31.750 --> 05:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
correctly if you call the manufacture
 
05:41:35.230 --> 05:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
they will refrain from advising you of
 
05:41:37.548 --> 05:41:37.558 align:start position:0%
how to install it and that giv gets back
 
05:41:39.548 --> 05:41:39.558 align:start position:0%
to my point about in order to have the
 
05:41:42.548 --> 05:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
seat belts effective and safe they need
 
05:41:44.590 --> 05:41:44.600 align:start position:0%
to follow Federal Regulations or
 
05:41:47.750 --> 05:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
somebody's regulations and the average
 
05:41:50.670 --> 05:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
hobbyist is is not likely to be able to
 
05:41:53.430 --> 05:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
do that even though many of our people
 
05:41:55.190 --> 05:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
already have installed seat belts on
 
05:41:58.430 --> 05:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
their own accord and my point is that's
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
the way it should be done on our own
 
05:42:02.990 --> 05:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
accord we don't need it regulated we
 
05:42:05.110 --> 05:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
don't need all the extra expense
 
05:42:07.628 --> 05:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
associated with it if we design to have
 
05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
them we'll put them
 
05:42:12.310 --> 05:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
on follow thank you um so along those
 
05:42:16.510 --> 05:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
lines um are you aware of a federal law
 
05:42:18.788 --> 05:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
or regulation as it pertains to seat
 
05:42:23.390 --> 05:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
belts for antique Autos yeah not thank
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%

05:42:28.030 --> 05:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
05:42:31.390 --> 05:42:31.400 align:start position:0%

sir thank you Mr chairman members of the

committee for the record my name is
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
Lawrence Arts from Nashville New
 
05:42:51.230 --> 05:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I own a couple of antique
 
05:42:56.430 --> 05:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles in 19 51 Ford Custom sedan
 
05:42:58.990 --> 05:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
which was an original car that I didn't
 
05:43:00.788 --> 05:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
actually look for the car the car kind
 
05:43:04.350 --> 05:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
of found me and it was uh inside of a
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
garage since
 
05:43:09.750 --> 05:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
1970 and I also own a 63 Chevy 2 Nova
 
05:43:09.760 --> 05:43:10.948 align:start position:0%
1970 and I also own a 63 Chevy 2 Nova
station

05:43:10.948 --> 05:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
station
 
05:43:13.788 --> 05:43:13.798 align:start position:0%
wagon right now I'm my station wagon's
 
05:43:13.798 --> 05:43:14.948 align:start position:0%
wagon right now I'm my station wagon's
undergo

05:43:14.948 --> 05:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
undergo
 
05:43:17.070 --> 05:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
restoration and I was looking at putting
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
seat bels into that
 
05:43:22.708 --> 05:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
car I had the whole interior taken
 
05:43:26.750 --> 05:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
out and I'm analyzing the B pillar if I
 
05:43:29.070 --> 05:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
were to put seat belts in that
 
05:43:31.350 --> 05:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
car I'm going to have to put some kind
 
05:43:33.990 --> 05:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
of a reinforcement inside the
 
05:43:36.788 --> 05:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
billar which means I'm going to have to
 
05:43:38.468 --> 05:43:38.478 align:start position:0%
cut into
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
it put in some kind of an e/ inch plate
 
05:43:43.270 --> 05:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
with a threaded hole or a nut welded on
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
the back side and somehow install it
 
05:43:48.110 --> 05:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
into that b pillar without distorting
 
05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
the B pillar from
 
05:43:54.030 --> 05:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
welding and try to make it look
 
05:43:56.350 --> 05:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
nice but I looked at that I looked at
 
05:43:58.590 --> 05:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
that pillar and said boy I don't want to
 
05:44:00.430 --> 05:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
the paint is so nice on the inside of
 
05:44:03.868 --> 05:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
that car I don't want to touch
 
05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
it if I screw it up if I make a mistake
 
05:44:10.230 --> 05:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to look awful when I when I
 
05:44:11.708 --> 05:44:11.718 align:start position:0%
put it together but the thing is you
 
05:44:15.590 --> 05:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
have in order to put seat bels in that
 
05:44:18.190 --> 05:44:18.200 align:start position:0%
car it takes it takes a lot of thought
 
05:44:21.230 --> 05:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
and and and planning on how to do it and
 
05:44:22.750 --> 05:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
you know I want to I'd like to put seat
 
05:44:25.868 --> 05:44:25.878 align:start position:0%
bels in that car but I don't it's it's
 
05:44:30.110 --> 05:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
too much it's too much involved to do it
 
05:44:32.030 --> 05:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
and then I looked at my 51 Ford my
 
05:44:35.150 --> 05:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
original 51 Ford the B pill is curved at
 
05:44:38.830 --> 05:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
the bottom and and uh I don't know how I
 
05:44:40.750 --> 05:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
would make a mount for that there's no
 
05:44:43.070 --> 05:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
crossmember underneath it I can't fasten
 
05:44:44.628 --> 05:44:44.638 align:start position:0%
I have to I have to have something
 
05:44:46.948 --> 05:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
strong underneath if I just go ahead and
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
bolt seat belts to the floor I get into
 
05:44:50.468 --> 05:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
an accident they'll just rip right out
 
05:44:52.708 --> 05:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
of that sheet metal there has to be some
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a reinforcement installed in it
 
05:44:55.990 --> 05:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
which means I'm going to have to
 
05:44:57.910 --> 05:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
fabricate something and so I am opposed
 
05:45:01.590 --> 05:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
to this bill and the other thing is it
 
05:45:03.750 --> 05:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
starts setting a precedent if you start
 
05:45:03.760 --> 05:45:05.310 align:start position:0%
starts setting a precedent if you start
retroactively

05:45:05.310 --> 05:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
05:45:08.830 --> 05:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
mandating especially equipment in cars
 
05:45:10.150 --> 05:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
then they're going to start mandating
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
dual pot Master cylinders antilock
 
05:45:17.190 --> 05:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
brakes um side marker lights head
 
05:45:19.548 --> 05:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
restraints um padded
 
05:45:21.510 --> 05:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
dashboards even
 
05:45:24.990 --> 05:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
airbags and you know it just won't end
 
05:45:26.510 --> 05:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
it won't end and pretty soon you have a
 
05:45:28.270 --> 05:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
car that that that you can't even
 
05:45:29.910 --> 05:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
recognize from the original car and it
 
05:45:32.510 --> 05:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
kind of defeats the purpose of having an
 
05:45:34.468 --> 05:45:34.478 align:start position:0%
antique car for having the uh unique
 
05:45:37.230 --> 05:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
features that it does have so for those
 
05:45:39.910 --> 05:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
reasons I am opposed to this
 
05:45:42.150 --> 05:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you any questions from
 
05:45:45.230 --> 05:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
the committee representative gon yes can
 
05:45:49.030 --> 05:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
you please speak to um the question of
 
05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
what the value of that vehicle is right
 
05:45:53.150 --> 05:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
now any of those vehicles in your
 
05:45:55.110 --> 05:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
collection Vice what the value would be
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
with these modifications what would your
 
05:45:59.030 --> 05:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
loss on your investment potential as a
 
05:45:59.040 --> 05:46:01.990 align:start position:0%
loss on your investment potential as a
collector

05:46:01.990 --> 05:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:05.110 --> 05:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
be with the modifications made I
 
05:46:07.510 --> 05:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
mean fully restored
 
05:46:10.190 --> 05:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh Chevy 2 I've seen them as high as
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
like 24 $25,000 they probably would you
 
05:46:16.750 --> 05:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
know 15 18,000 it's kind of hard to put
 
05:46:18.628 --> 05:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
a number on it because you know really
 
05:46:21.548 --> 05:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
the value of the car is uh what one's
 
05:46:23.670 --> 05:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
willing to pay for it and I'll tell you
 
05:46:27.030 --> 05:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
they'll get good money if the car was as
 
05:46:29.670 --> 05:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
original as can be and not all cut up
 
05:46:29.680 --> 05:46:31.868 align:start position:0%
original as can be and not all cut up
and

05:46:31.868 --> 05:46:31.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:46:34.270 --> 05:46:34.280 align:start position:0%

05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%

currently the president of the central
 
05:47:02.110 --> 05:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire model te Club um I have uh
 
05:47:04.788 --> 05:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
four cars that I own that are uh model
 
05:47:07.468 --> 05:47:07.478 align:start position:0%
year 1930 or earlier so pretty familiar
 
05:47:09.910 --> 05:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
with the antique um as as n been
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned those of us in the antique car
 
05:47:13.670 --> 05:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
Community are are um very concerned
 
05:47:15.468 --> 05:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
about safety we do a lot to make sure
 
05:47:16.868 --> 05:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
that our cars are safe to drive we like
 
05:47:18.190 --> 05:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
to drive them we obviously don't want to
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
get an accidents within our club and I
 
05:47:21.990 --> 05:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
know some of the other clubs we actually
 
05:47:24.270 --> 05:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
have um Tech sessions sometimes where we
 
05:47:25.830 --> 05:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
will get the club members together and
 
05:47:27.990 --> 05:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
go over and and you know put it up on a
 
05:47:29.468 --> 05:47:29.478 align:start position:0%
lift and say you should be checking this
 
05:47:32.030 --> 05:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
you should be checking this and um also
 
05:47:33.868 --> 05:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
has already been mentioned um a lot of
 
05:47:36.910 --> 05:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
us have added stuff to the cars um to
 
05:47:38.590 --> 05:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
make them much safer in the Model T
 
05:47:41.310 --> 05:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
world that's usually directional signals
 
05:47:43.310 --> 05:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
um better braking systems better
 
05:47:46.868 --> 05:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
lighting things like that um those um
 
05:47:49.548 --> 05:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
things can mostly be added to the car in
 
05:47:52.830 --> 05:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
a way that they could be removed okay
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
and generally um have neutral uh impact
 
05:47:58.030 --> 05:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
on the value of the car or increase the
 
05:47:59.788 --> 05:47:59.798 align:start position:0%
value of the car because they're not
 
05:48:01.868 --> 05:48:01.878 align:start position:0%
really destroying the car as it is as
 
05:48:06.510 --> 05:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
it's original um but that said um even
 
05:48:08.948 --> 05:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
um even with our our focus on safety we
 
05:48:10.548 --> 05:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
don't believe that this proposed bill
 
05:48:13.868 --> 05:48:13.878 align:start position:0%
for seat belts um is is is a wise idea
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
there's a number of points that like to
 
05:48:18.070 --> 05:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
make um about that um one is a couple
 
05:48:19.670 --> 05:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
points are kind of technical one one
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
says in the in the bill it says that um
 
05:48:24.030 --> 05:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
the section is not intended to supersede
 
05:48:26.548 --> 05:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
any other law requiring the use of seat
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
or safety belts um and um there's it's
 
05:48:34.590 --> 05:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
RSA 26 266 62a says any motor vehicle
 
05:48:36.390 --> 05:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
whose model year 60 years or old shall
 
05:48:38.868 --> 05:48:38.878 align:start position:0%
be ex from all motor vehicle equipment
 
05:48:41.070 --> 05:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
and inspection requirements if the motor
 
05:48:42.430 --> 05:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle is equipped as it was
 
05:48:44.190 --> 05:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
manufactured or in accordance with the
 
05:48:46.430 --> 05:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles original equipment
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
specifications so that seems to be um in
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
conflict and would make this
 
05:48:51.948 --> 05:48:51.958 align:start position:0%
unenforceable and it kind of answers
 
05:48:54.910 --> 05:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
your question earlier um the cars are
 
05:48:57.750 --> 05:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
generally required to be equipped as
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
they were when they were manufactured so
 
05:49:01.670 --> 05:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
if a car if there's no requirements for
 
05:49:03.350 --> 05:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
directional signals at the time the car
 
05:49:05.628 --> 05:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
was manufactured there's no requirement
 
05:49:07.070 --> 05:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
to have it now you can still stick use a
 
05:49:08.590 --> 05:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
hand signals out your window if you want
 
05:49:10.310 --> 05:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
to although that's a very common
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
modification because we want to be seen
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:20.150 --> 05:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
um as you know uh New Hampshire only
 
05:49:24.468 --> 05:49:24.478 align:start position:0%
requires seat belt use for um persons
 
05:49:26.830 --> 05:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
younger than 18 years old um this
 
05:49:29.230 --> 05:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill States all people in the
 
05:49:32.590 --> 05:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
car is no exception for um for any age
 
05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
so that seems to be a discrepancy as
 
05:49:38.110 --> 05:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
well um ALS so in New Hampshire any
 
05:49:41.190 --> 05:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle that's 25 years old or older can
 
05:49:43.468 --> 05:49:43.478 align:start position:0%
be registered as an antique but when you
 
05:49:45.548 --> 05:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
do register a car as an antique there
 
05:49:47.070 --> 05:49:47.080 align:start position:0%
are certain restrictions that come with
 
05:49:48.548 --> 05:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
that as to where you can use it you know
 
05:49:49.868 --> 05:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
you can't use it as your daily driver
 
05:49:52.230 --> 05:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
for example if it's an antique car so
 
05:49:54.310 --> 05:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
some people with cars that are 25 years
 
05:49:56.830 --> 05:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
or older um choose to do standard
 
05:49:58.510 --> 05:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
registration instead of antique
 
05:49:59.990 --> 05:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
registration because they want to use
 
05:50:03.788 --> 05:50:03.798 align:start position:0%
them more as a normal car um there's no
 
05:50:06.350 --> 05:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
definition in this proposed bill as to
 
05:50:07.868 --> 05:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
what you know where would the where the
 
05:50:10.070 --> 05:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement be if you have a 1960 car
 
05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
that you're daily driving is not antique
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
register does that count as an antique
 
05:50:14.788 --> 05:50:14.798 align:start position:0%
car or not you know and where there's a
 
05:50:17.270 --> 05:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
lot of uh sort of enforcement actions
 
05:50:20.430 --> 05:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
there um that are kind of
 
05:50:24.150 --> 05:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
difficult um the next Point uh HP 326
 
05:50:27.030 --> 05:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
proposed HP 326 refers to the applicable
 
05:50:31.510 --> 05:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
standards in USD um 49 CFR 571 207 to
 
05:50:34.070 --> 05:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
210 for seat belt requirements and that
 
05:50:38.270 --> 05:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
raises a lot of issues um
 
05:50:42.350 --> 05:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
49 C 57128 which talks about what safety
 
05:50:44.510 --> 05:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
equipment needs to be installed in cars
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
um only talks about cars from January
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
1st 1972 on so there's there's no
 
05:50:51.788 --> 05:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
reference in there for any older cars so
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
when you talk about app applicable
 
05:50:56.750 --> 05:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
standards from those cfrs are there even
 
05:50:58.310 --> 05:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
any applicable standards or how does
 
05:51:00.030 --> 05:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
that you know reference it it seems to
 
05:51:02.510 --> 05:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
be um quite a conflict
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
there um 571 207 is really about seat
 
05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
installations and how the seats are are
 
05:51:10.548 --> 05:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
mounted cars and stuff like that and
 
05:51:13.270 --> 05:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
that includes a lot of requirements um
 
05:51:15.708 --> 05:51:15.718 align:start position:0%
around longitudinal lateral Force
 
05:51:18.150 --> 05:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
testing and things like that um you know
 
05:51:19.990 --> 05:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's like 20 times the weight uh you
 
05:51:21.708 --> 05:51:21.718 align:start position:0%
know the seat structure has to hold seat
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
latches and stuff like that stuff that
 
05:51:26.030 --> 05:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
would be um virtually impossible to
 
05:51:27.948 --> 05:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
achieve in a car that wasn't designed
 
05:51:29.750 --> 05:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
for that you can't just modify the seat
 
05:51:31.910 --> 05:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
the whole car structure has to be
 
05:51:34.030 --> 05:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
designed around those requirements and
 
05:51:36.350 --> 05:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to be able to um
 
05:51:40.628 --> 05:51:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh to be met in a modified antique car
 
05:51:42.948 --> 05:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
um as was mentioned the structure of
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
many antique cars is not at all like a
 
05:51:49.190 --> 05:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
modern car um it was very common um back
 
05:51:52.030 --> 05:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
in the day that the car body um was not
 
05:51:54.628 --> 05:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
even made by the the branded car
 
05:51:56.468 --> 05:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
manufacturer they were added after or
 
05:51:58.510 --> 05:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
there was a in in the case of four they
 
05:52:00.830 --> 05:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
they were importing um bodies from a
 
05:52:02.150 --> 05:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
couple different cars and they put on
 
05:52:03.628 --> 05:52:03.638 align:start position:0%
there a lot of the body structures are
 
05:52:07.150 --> 05:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
wood um there simply are not seat belt
 
05:52:10.030 --> 05:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
anchor points in these cars um that you
 
05:52:11.230 --> 05:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
you you know you can't bolt it down the
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
floorboards that that are only held in
 
05:52:14.830 --> 05:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
by a couple sheet screws or something
 
05:52:16.230 --> 05:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
like that you know that's not going to
 
05:52:21.310 --> 05:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
hold anything at all um so it's it would
 
05:52:24.510 --> 05:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
be next to impossible to mount seat
 
05:52:26.390 --> 05:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
belts that would meet the requirements
 
05:52:29.788 --> 05:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
of 571 210 it just it just doesn't
 
05:52:32.510 --> 05:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
exist they're also in in that whole
 
05:52:35.868 --> 05:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
section that whole group of uh the cfrs
 
05:52:37.990 --> 05:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
um there extensive testing requirements
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
for how these things are tested which
 
05:52:40.910 --> 05:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
makes a whole lot of sense if you're
 
05:52:43.110 --> 05:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
designing a new car and and you're going
 
05:52:45.030 --> 05:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
through that testing but I've no idea
 
05:52:46.548 --> 05:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
how that would be accomplished if you
 
05:52:48.910 --> 05:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
were trying to retrofit an old car a lot
 
05:52:50.830 --> 05:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
of that destruct that that testing is
 
05:52:53.150 --> 05:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
destructive um so you know if you put a
 
05:52:54.788 --> 05:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
seat belt in and you and you and you
 
05:52:56.230 --> 05:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
pull on it and it doesn't quite meet the
 
05:52:58.030 --> 05:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and it rips the car apart
 
05:52:59.190 --> 05:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know that that really is
 
05:53:01.150 --> 05:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
incompatible with a custom um
 
05:53:03.230 --> 05:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
application that's going to be done um
 
05:53:04.468 --> 05:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
car by
 
05:53:07.150 --> 05:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
car um we also think if would be next to
 
05:53:09.628 --> 05:53:09.638 align:start position:0%
impossible to find a shop that would be
 
05:53:11.548 --> 05:53:11.558 align:start position:0%
willing to do any kind of sheet Bel
 
05:53:13.230 --> 05:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
installation like this um due to
 
05:53:15.830 --> 05:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
perceived liability you know if a shop
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
um you know there's some really good
 
05:53:18.590 --> 05:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
shops that work on antique cars in New
 
05:53:21.150 --> 05:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but if if a car was brought
 
05:53:23.150 --> 05:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
to them and say hey here's this new law
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
I need to have seat bels in store inall
 
05:53:26.270 --> 05:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
this card to meet these Federal
 
05:53:28.430 --> 05:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
standards I'm pretty sure all the shops
 
05:53:30.510 --> 05:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
would decline to do that um because if
 
05:53:32.110 --> 05:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
that car is in an accident and someone
 
05:53:36.190 --> 05:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
was hurt or injured um or or even killed
 
05:53:39.070 --> 05:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
um worst case um the lawyers are going
 
05:53:40.548 --> 05:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
to be coming back to that shop and say
 
05:53:42.110 --> 05:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
hey you didn't really do it right and
 
05:53:43.430 --> 05:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that's a liability they're not
 
05:53:45.628 --> 05:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
going to um want to take on and I
 
05:53:47.110 --> 05:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
believe the state would also face the
 
05:53:48.990 --> 05:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
liability as well um if the state's
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
required an installation to something
 
05:53:52.548 --> 05:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
that was essentially impossible to
 
05:53:55.150 --> 05:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
achieve and there was a serious accident
 
05:53:57.990 --> 05:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
um the the the state may may um May face
 
05:53:59.948 --> 05:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
some liability as
 
05:54:04.590 --> 05:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
well um as far as um and next
 
05:54:06.910 --> 05:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
point the older cars especially the cars
 
05:54:08.230 --> 05:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with tend to be a little
 
05:54:09.548 --> 05:54:09.558 align:start position:0%
bit top heavy so they're somewhat
 
05:54:11.350 --> 05:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
susceptible for rollover accidents you
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
know we you know we're not out driving
 
05:54:14.708 --> 05:54:14.718 align:start position:0%
on the highways and things like that so
 
05:54:17.390 --> 05:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
we we really accents are pretty rare but
 
05:54:19.670 --> 05:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
I've heard of that um prior to at least
 
05:54:22.510 --> 05:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
1930 the most popular car types were
 
05:54:24.310 --> 05:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
what they call touring and roadsters
 
05:54:25.750 --> 05:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's basically what you today call a
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
convertible right and there is no roller
 
05:54:31.270 --> 05:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
protection in those cars so if you were
 
05:54:33.430 --> 05:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
in a rollover accident and I've seen
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
some pretty horrible pictures and you
 
05:54:36.910 --> 05:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
were builted in you're guaranteed to be
 
05:54:40.270 --> 05:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
crushed by that car okay so you know
 
05:54:41.708 --> 05:54:41.718 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a trade-off right you
 
05:54:43.030 --> 05:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
know if you've thrown from the car
 
05:54:45.750 --> 05:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's not good either but if there's a
 
05:54:47.910 --> 05:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
2,000 pound car sitting on top of you
 
05:54:49.548 --> 05:54:49.558 align:start position:0%
upside down that's not going to be good
 
05:54:53.190 --> 05:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
at all um even the closed cars um again
 
05:54:54.830 --> 05:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know they look a lot stronger but
 
05:54:56.670 --> 05:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
they're not designed for rollover they
 
05:54:59.430 --> 05:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
just weren't back then so um you know a
 
05:55:00.910 --> 05:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
closed car and a roll over accid is
 
05:55:01.708 --> 05:55:01.718 align:start position:0%
probably going to give you more
 
05:55:03.270 --> 05:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
protection than an open car but it's
 
05:55:04.868 --> 05:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
it's not to give you the protection of a
 
05:55:08.350 --> 05:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:12.030 --> 05:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
um H the proposed HB 326 in the fiscal
 
05:55:14.350 --> 05:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
note um it says that there'll be no
 
05:55:16.070 --> 05:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
Financial impact at the state county or
 
05:55:17.910 --> 05:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
local level um we don't think that's
 
05:55:21.110 --> 05:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
true um there's a lot of uh antique car
 
05:55:22.750 --> 05:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
shows and tours that happen in the state
 
05:55:24.830 --> 05:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
every year um a couple of examples
 
05:55:27.190 --> 05:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
there's a a a very big show at Castle in
 
05:55:29.190 --> 05:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
the clouds every fall that that pulls
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
hundreds of cars from all over the state
 
05:55:33.830 --> 05:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
and even out of state um the horses
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
Carriage Club has a brass and gas Court
 
05:55:37.788 --> 05:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
uh tour every year every other the year
 
05:55:38.708 --> 05:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
that typically goes through New
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there's a lot of local
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
shows um that that are fundraisers for a
 
05:55:46.190 --> 05:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
lot of Charities and it's very typical
 
05:55:47.750 --> 05:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
for people to drive their empti cars
 
05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
farther than 20 miles to get there for
 
05:55:50.990 --> 05:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
me I I've been to cast Claus two or
 
05:55:52.590 --> 05:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
three times that's a 70 mile drive each
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
way in a 1915 car um and you know it
 
05:55:59.430 --> 05:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
which is obviously well out of the um of
 
05:56:02.708 --> 05:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
of the limit of the uh um the 20 miles
 
05:56:05.910 --> 05:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
um there also are um many of the clubs
 
05:56:07.390 --> 05:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
run tours where we'll get a bunch of the
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
cars together and run a tour around New
 
05:56:10.910 --> 05:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and go visit some tour spots
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that and those tours can
 
05:56:15.468 --> 05:56:15.478 align:start position:0%
easily be 50 or 100 miles or more um so
 
05:56:17.430 --> 05:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of that stuff would probably just
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
not happen if this was a requirement
 
05:56:20.708 --> 05:56:20.718 align:start position:0%
because people would not be doing these
 
05:56:22.948 --> 05:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
modifications to the car and that has an
 
05:56:25.548 --> 05:56:25.558 align:start position:0%
impact on on the um you know on
 
05:56:28.190 --> 05:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
fundraising for people on um on other
 
05:56:30.590 --> 05:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
businesses that are are being patronized
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
by people on these tours and stuff like
 
05:56:35.708 --> 05:56:35.718 align:start position:0%
that um despite the fact that there have
 
05:56:37.990 --> 05:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
been some accidents in in these cars
 
05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
they're it's not common um you know we
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
we know obviously in the community is
 
05:56:45.190 --> 05:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
pretty close and we know of accidents
 
05:56:46.548 --> 05:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
have happened we know if accidents have
 
05:56:48.510 --> 05:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
happened outside of New Hampshire um
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunate but it's not not a
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
common occurrence um you know we're not
 
05:56:53.830 --> 05:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
putting the kind of miles on these cars
 
05:56:56.110 --> 05:56:56.120 align:start position:0%
you put on your modern cars um we're
 
05:56:58.190 --> 05:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
driving them in appropriate areas in you
 
05:57:00.270 --> 05:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
know in cars from the the 20s and stuff
 
05:57:02.030 --> 05:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're not out on the highway with
 
05:57:03.390 --> 05:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
them we're on the back road and stuff
 
05:57:05.670 --> 05:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
like that so accidents do happen but we
 
05:57:08.310 --> 05:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
don't think that is um that the lack of
 
05:57:11.868 --> 05:57:11.878 align:start position:0%
seat belts is really um creating a big
 
05:57:15.070 --> 05:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
safety issue and um I don't know if you
 
05:57:17.150 --> 05:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
remember from the very early days of
 
05:57:20.430 --> 05:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
seat bels back in the 60s and 70s um you
 
05:57:24.110 --> 05:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
know a lat belt only um offer some
 
05:57:25.868 --> 05:57:25.878 align:start position:0%
protection but you know some in some
 
05:57:27.468 --> 05:57:27.478 align:start position:0%
cases it it held you in place while you
 
05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
get slammed into the steering column and
 
05:57:30.350 --> 05:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so there's definitely a
 
05:57:32.110 --> 05:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
trade-off there right and we're not
 
05:57:34.190 --> 05:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
trying to argue that driving antique
 
05:57:35.868 --> 05:57:35.878 align:start position:0%
cars is safe there's definitely a safety
 
05:57:37.990 --> 05:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
trade trade off with driving these cars
 
05:57:39.230 --> 05:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
but it's something that everyone's aware
 
05:57:40.430 --> 05:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
of and we're trying to make it as safe
 
05:57:42.788 --> 05:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
as possible and we don't believe that
 
05:57:45.708 --> 05:57:45.718 align:start position:0%
adding seat belts is going to help that
 
05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
um and just one final Point um you know
 
05:57:49.708 --> 05:57:49.718 align:start position:0%
it's been discussed a little bit is that
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
part of the value of anti cars is
 
05:57:55.548 --> 05:57:55.558 align:start position:0%
related to their originality right and
 
05:57:58.110 --> 05:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
um as I talked a little bit about here
 
05:58:00.270 --> 05:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
there is there is no way that you could
 
05:58:04.390 --> 05:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
add seat bels in a 1915 car or even a
 
05:58:07.510 --> 05:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
1960 car without major structural
 
05:58:10.350 --> 05:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
modifications um it the the car
 
05:58:12.548 --> 05:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
structure is just not designed for that
 
05:58:16.190 --> 05:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
and and it would um uh you know someone
 
05:58:17.708 --> 05:58:17.718 align:start position:0%
asked a question before about the value
 
05:58:19.670 --> 05:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
I there's no market for cars that are
 
05:58:21.230 --> 05:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
modified that way so it's very hard to
 
05:58:23.948 --> 05:58:23.958 align:start position:0%
say what the um what the value would be
 
05:58:25.708 --> 05:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
if the car was modified that way but if
 
05:58:28.590 --> 05:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
I add and and one thing in a mod to you
 
05:58:30.590 --> 05:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
can add aftermarket dis brakes on that
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
car that doesn't reduce the value of the
 
05:58:34.230 --> 05:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
car because they're very easy to take
 
05:58:35.510 --> 05:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
off if someone wants to buy it for
 
05:58:35.520 --> 05:58:36.788 align:start position:0%
off if someone wants to buy it for
originality

05:58:36.788 --> 05:58:36.798 align:start position:0%
originality
 
05:58:38.310 --> 05:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
and in some cases that's seen as a
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
safety feature that that increases the
 
05:58:41.150 --> 05:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
value of the cost so that's that's a
 
05:58:43.590 --> 05:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
whole different level of thing so um I
 
05:58:45.150 --> 05:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
think that the the significant
 
05:58:46.708 --> 05:58:46.718 align:start position:0%
structural modifications that would be
 
05:58:49.030 --> 05:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
made uh have to be made to an anti car
 
05:58:50.430 --> 05:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
to add seat bels that would meet all
 
05:58:53.030 --> 05:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
these standards um just makes it um
 
05:58:54.990 --> 05:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
impossible and I think most owners would
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
opt not to do that and would be limited
 
05:58:58.350 --> 05:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
to where they can drive their cars and
 
05:59:02.788 --> 05:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
stuff um so it it seems that HP 326 has
 
05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
been proposed without really fully
 
05:59:06.910 --> 05:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
considering all this stuff um we don't
 
05:59:08.990 --> 05:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
think that this is the right approach um
 
05:59:11.990 --> 05:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
to to addressing safety in antique cars
 
05:59:14.750 --> 05:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
and um we hope that this bill is is uh
 
05:59:17.830 --> 05:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
is is not passed so thank you any
 
05:59:19.310 --> 05:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you so
 
05:59:24.270 --> 05:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
much before I close out the hearing I
 
05:59:26.110 --> 05:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
see some people standing and sitting in
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
there do you want to add anything
 
05:59:29.590 --> 05:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
because I have no more cards left before
 
05:59:30.788 --> 05:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
I close the
 
05:59:33.070 --> 05:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on this
 
05:59:36.070 --> 05:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
bill I will I need a I need a pink C
 
05:59:38.990 --> 05:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
one we can fill out afterwards for
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
present Pro just let me
 
05:59:46.110 --> 05:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
know can make it short and quick it be
 
05:59:47.830 --> 05:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
pretty great I'm a True Believer on the
 
05:59:51.910 --> 05:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
three minute rule so I own a 67 Mustang
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
and pretty much all he said was right on
 
05:59:56.750 --> 05:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
it changes the value of the vehicle and
 
05:59:59.230 --> 05:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
whatever and if I remember right we were
 
06:00:02.430 --> 06:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
the last state to go to seat belts
 
06:00:09.628 --> 06:00:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:13.070 --> 06:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
oh right but before that we fought that
 
06:00:13.080 --> 06:00:15.030 align:start position:0%
oh right but before that we fought that
too

06:00:15.030 --> 06:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:00:18.350 --> 06:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
so why are we trying to impose this on
 
06:00:22.070 --> 06:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
old cars that I know when I drive my
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
67 I'm very careful with it I know other
 
06:00:28.548 --> 06:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
people aren't around me
 
06:00:32.708 --> 06:00:32.718 align:start position:0%
but so it so I really don't think we
 
06:00:35.270 --> 06:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
need to be forcing people to put seat
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
belt in cars that some of them don't go
 
06:00:42.628 --> 06:00:42.638 align:start position:0%
very fast anyway but just my two cents
 
06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate
 
06:00:47.468 --> 06:00:47.478 align:start position:0%
your letting me
 
06:00:49.590 --> 06:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
speak okay with that I don't have any
 
06:00:51.750 --> 06:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
other any other slips so at this point
 
06:00:54.030 --> 06:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
 
06:00:54.040 --> 06:00:55.990 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the public hearing on
