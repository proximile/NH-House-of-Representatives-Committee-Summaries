00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
thanks for being here I'm gonna open up
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work on HB 183
 
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.409 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work on HB 183
um

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
I would like to start actually if I can
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
have uh Justin cutting
 
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
come up and just share with us uh once
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
again some of the concerns that the fire
 
00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 align:start position:0%
academy has and and how they think that
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
this bill will will help to resolve
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
those and we can ask some questions and
 
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 align:start position:0%
kind of dig into the to the meat of it
 
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
so thank you for joining us sure good
 
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
morning sir uh for the record my name is
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
Justin cutting I am the director of the
 
00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 align:start position:0%
division of fire standards and training
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
in EMS
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
one of the struggles that we continually
 
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
have is finding enough instructors to
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
effectively deliver our programs and
 
00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
it's a significant challenge because EMS
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
and fire agencies across New Hampshire
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
are really struggling to recruit and
 
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
retain members and this is a two-part
 
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
issue if they put in the work and the
 
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
effort to recruit these members they
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
then look to us to provide sometimes the
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
initial training and at times the
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing training we offer a number of
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
different programs it does require
 
00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
people to effectively deliver those from
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
and we seem to have struggled more and
 
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:03.170 align:start position:0%
and we seem to have struggled more and
more

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
the last four or five years to fill
 
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 align:start position:0%
those spots so any efforts that can be
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
made to help not only the Recruitment
 
00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:12.139 align:start position:0%
and Retention but for us to be able to
 
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:14.699 align:start position:0%
adequately staff those positions is
 
00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:18.710 align:start position:0%
adequately staff those positions is
helpful

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
either of you guys have any questions
 
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.510 align:start position:0%
either of you guys have any questions
particularly

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
I have some so I'll dig in
 
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.330 align:start position:0%
I have some so I'll dig in
um

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
how many additional hours I mean if if
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
we do this it
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
I mean it's hard to say how much it will
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
bump up somebody's ability to
 
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
participate because we don't know how
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
much they're participating in other
 
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
Arenas that's limiting their hours how
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
many hours on average per person
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh do you think would allow you to meet
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
your goals so as opposed to say like
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
just suspending the rule altogether we
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
said well they have X number of hours
 
00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:57.419 align:start position:0%
that they can dedicate to the fire
 
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
academy that doesn't go towards other
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
hours do you have any concept of how
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
many hours maybe would be useful like
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
something without exempting the whole
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
thing I don't have a specific number and
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons is because what we're
 
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:13.259 align:start position:0%
trying to do as a really a customer
 
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
service organization is provide the
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
training that's needed we take in course
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
requests in addition to our normal
 
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
offerings so those courses could vary
 
00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
over time and they all take a different
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
level of our number of instructors per
 
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
module per program overall and it
 
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
depends on the number of each of those
 
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
programs that we deliver each year okay
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
how many instructors do you have
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
currently that are
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
classified as
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
working full-time at another at a fire
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
department in the fire service versus
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
those that you have that are retired
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
I don't have that number you mean so we
 
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
have a total of a 187 instructors about
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
25 percent of them are group two
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
retirees currently I don't have the
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
breakdown on who are actively full-time
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
working and working for us part-time
 
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.850 align:start position:0%
working and working for us part-time
absolutely

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
and you are aware of the cumulative 1600
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
hours that they can work in the year not
 
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
just the 24 hours per week so that can
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
be adjusted in the classes offered and I
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead this might be unrelated
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
but I was going to ask the first time we
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
had the meeting the so do you train
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
people that are not employed for
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
volunteer or professional for instance
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
somebody that just needs a certification
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
for their job do you know what I'm
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
trying to get it or those or that's not
 
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
handled by you at all that's so for
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
firefighter training there are
 
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.430 align:start position:0%
firefighter training there are
affiliated

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
affiliated
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
personnel which already belonged to a
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
department and then people that do not
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
belong to a fire department yet would be
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
non-affiliated we would train both of
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
them we give priority seeding to people
 
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019 align:start position:0%
who already work for a fire department
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to train those that
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
have made that commitment
 
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much appreciate you coming
 
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
thank you so much appreciate you coming
in

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
um did anybody else want to say anything
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
on 183 who's in the room
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
and do we have anybody from the
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system here
 
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry my name is Mark
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
Cavanaugh I'm associate Council and
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
compliance officer for the retirement
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
system of pinch hitting for Marty who
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
came down with covet yesterday
 
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
that's unfortunate I hope he's doing
 
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
well he's doing all right
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
um just real quick to start off one of
 
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
the major concerns with the piece of
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
legislation is just how it's going to
 
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
affect the uaal
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
um I think there's less concern if the
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
retirement system is fully funded but
 
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
obviously uh
 
00:11:08.569 --> 00:11:08.579 align:start position:0%
there is some concern that
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
pulling full-timers out of this out of
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
the system replacing them with
 
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
part-timers if we expand this will
 
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
affect the you know the pay down on the
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
uaal do you have any insight into how it
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
might affect that I do not believe that
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
this would have any effect because there
 
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
there are only so many full-time
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
positions at the Academy or at fire
 
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
standards in general and it's our
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that they're not intending
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
to reduce that full-time staff and
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
replace it with part-time people they're
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
just looking to allow their part-time
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
people to work more hours so we we
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
didn't we didn't even have the actuary
 
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:43.940 align:start position:0%
look at that such a small population
 
00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:46.019 align:start position:0%
even if they did it for a couple of
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
positions it would be such a de minimis
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
our other concern would be that as you
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
cover an exception for one cohort
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
people get in line and say me too
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
there'll be schools saying oh retired
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
teachers it'll be you know whatever
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
department or or or employer says why
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
don't I get the exception I have the
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
same retention needs and the like that
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
that would be our only long-term concern
 
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.130 align:start position:0%
that would be our only long-term concern
that

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
possibly full-time positions could be
 
00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
replaced with part-time positions okay
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you uh anybody have any yeah
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard would it be
 
00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:23.459 align:start position:0%
possible to put a sunset Clause into
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
this just to abbreviate any of those
 
00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
concerns I had been thinking something
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
similar we can discuss it during
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
yeah for sure
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate it
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
you're welcome yes representative Wolf
 
00:12:58.009 --> 00:12:58.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Dan Wolf from Newbury and
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'm the prime sponsor of this bill
 
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh a sunset provision
 
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
would be excellent to try it out see if
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
it solves the problem and you don't have
 
00:13:14.569 --> 00:13:14.579 align:start position:0%
it forever so uh I strongly recommend
 
00:13:14.579 --> 00:13:15.889 align:start position:0%
it forever so uh I strongly recommend
that

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
recommend that with most legislation I
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
agree with you thank you I think that
 
00:13:24.769 --> 00:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
could solve the immediate problem and if
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
it's not causing something you can renew
 
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
it again in five years or you let it
 
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
lapse so I would be more than acceptable
 
00:13:34.329 --> 00:13:34.339 align:start position:0%
to that Amendment
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
and just from the prime sponsor's
 
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:38.820 align:start position:0%
perspective what do you think an
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
adequate amount of time to let the
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
program run would be
 
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:44.940 align:start position:0%
you got to go at least three and maybe
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
up to five but I wouldn't go any more
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
than five yeah so if we went like four
 
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
that would give us two terms and then
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
the next legislation legislative group
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
could look at it I think that's a very
 
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.300 align:start position:0%
happy compromise between three and five
 
00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:58.019 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative appreciate it
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
oh sorry uh any questions would you take
 
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:09.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
the representative wolf and taking my
 
00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:12.889 align:start position:0%
the representative wolf and taking my
question

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I see here there is an amendment to
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
this from uh representative Boyd are you
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
in full agreement with the um presented
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
amendment that was to put it to the uh
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
police academy as well include the
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
police academy I think so they're having
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
the same situation
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
but uh you follow up let's go ahead but
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
it seems to be as it stands right now
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
the one that is very acute
 
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
with no real full time seems to be the
 
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:44.220 align:start position:0%
fire service correct that's correct and
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
it seems like the police do have some
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
instructors that are compensated
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
full-time that's correct
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else question for representative
 
00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.930 align:start position:0%
anybody else question for representative
wolf

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
wolf
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative appreciate it
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
um anybody else wish to speak on 183
 
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.850 align:start position:0%
um anybody else wish to speak on 183
foreign

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:13.860 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
all right well then why don't we go into
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
kind of executive discussion among the
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
members here
 
00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:19.730 align:start position:0%
members here
um

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
anybody have any uh any immediate gut
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a couple of different
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
issues one uh do we extend it from fire
 
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
to police as well
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
um to uh do we completely pull it out
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
um or do we limit it to a certain number
 
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
of hours that are Exempted and then
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
three potential Sunset Clause to it you
 
00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:43.139 align:start position:0%
know do we do we put a sunset closet and
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
when do we do that uh anybody have any
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts yeah representative Gerhard I
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
think three-year Sunset Clause would be
 
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
think three-year Sunset Clause would be
preferable

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
preferable
 
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
just shorter if it's good it works it's
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
not going to have a problem with passing
 
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.069 align:start position:0%
not going to have a problem with passing
again

00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative true I apologize my my
 
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
doctor was not on time
 
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.090 align:start position:0%
doctor was not on time
um

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
well I I missed
 
00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
any testimony from this morning
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
um was there any uh
 
00:16:15.889 --> 00:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
amount of hours listed that people would
 
00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:18.779 align:start position:0%
be looking for like how many hours does
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
the fire fighter Academy need
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
yeah that question was asked because of
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
the nature of it he wasn't able to give
 
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
us a direct answer to it basically if we
 
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
remove this
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
um provision uh for part-time from uh
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
the rsas uh a person would be able to
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
spend 29 and a half hours working for
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
the fire academy in 29 and a half hours
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
working elsewhere
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
um as a retired person so a total of 59
 
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.350 align:start position:0%
um as a retired person so a total of 59
hours

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
um so the question is is do we allow for
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
that much or do we limit it but we don't
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
have a specific number of what would be
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
useful to them to limit it to
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes I have a comment the previous limit
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
of 1600 hours as opposed to the 13th was
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
con was considered Enough by a lot of
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
people so I I was thinking you could put
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
a limit of 300 hours at the Academy on
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
top of whatever they worked outside if
 
00:17:22.429 --> 00:17:22.439 align:start position:0%
that would make sense because that would
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
allow them
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
and I'll wait to teach as necessary but
 
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
certainly not anywhere near full time so
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
that's just that's the difference
 
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:34.340 align:start position:0%
between the 1664 and the
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
yeah representative goalie
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chair and
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
my biggest concern is
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
like was stated by the retirement system
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
once we open up this box there's going
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
to be other folks in the next three
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
years here knocking on the door with the
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
same argument and
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
this committee it previously has taken a
 
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
strong stance on the number of hours are
 
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:10.620 align:start position:0%
the number of hours we're much more
 
00:18:12.409 --> 00:18:12.419 align:start position:0%
liberal than I think uh and I think we
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
can get the from the retirement system
 
00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
than other states surrounding us as the
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
number of hours we allow our retirees to
 
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.890 align:start position:0%
number of hours we allow our retirees to
work

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
um some other states I think are far
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
fewer hours
 
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.730 align:start position:0%
fewer hours
um

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
than we have so we're generous already
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
with the hours we allow our retirees to
 
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.789 align:start position:0%
with the hours we allow our retirees to
work

00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I might have clarification
 
00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:35.299 align:start position:0%
from the retirement system on Mike
 
00:18:35.299 --> 00:18:36.890 align:start position:0%
from the retirement system on Mike
yes

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:36.900 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
our hours are higher than most
 
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
some states don't allow it at all others
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
have it around 600 or 900 some have
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
exceptions for high need jobs like stem
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
teachers and the like the standards vary
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
in a lot of States just don't allow you
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
to work at all after you retire
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
but we have a very generous in terms of
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
number of hours right now it's 1352 if
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
you re if you're retiring after one one
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh 18. and or 19 and um
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
1664 if you had been retired before that
 
00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
long as you're still working with the
 
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
same employer you had been working with
 
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
same employer you had been working with
part-time

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.090 align:start position:0%
part-time
um

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
with respect to people who work for
 
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:24.740 align:start position:0%
multiple employers I think
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
from an administrative point of view
 
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
just having a number that's combined
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
that they can go to you know maybe take
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
1352 and make it 1664. for those people
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
however they mix it as opposed to saying
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
you can work
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
1352 with one employer plus X number
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
hours at the Academy maybe someone wants
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
to work 900 hours at the Academy and 400
 
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
hours somewhere else uh that that just
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
would provide more flexibility be easy
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
to administer if it was just a set
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
number of hours and then the person
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
could decide how to allocate that
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
um do you know
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not other states are
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
having similar issues with their
 
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
restrictive nature as far as routine
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a trend to to make
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
exceptions because of the same retention
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
issues that we Face here are the states
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
face the same especially in the teaching
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
profession so you've seen some movement
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
to create exceptions
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
um but it hasn't been a rushed to the
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
door it's it's not a huge trend okay
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Brown yes
 
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.529 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Brown yes
uh

00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:36.539 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Kavanaugh for taking my
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'll give you like an example and
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment and this
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
particular Bill uh like let's say in the
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
city of Nashua and I did do it but I
 
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
made sure I was under the hours but the
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
shortage of teachers so I did a little
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
bit of substitute teaching could have
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
worked more but I always tried to stay
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
within the letter of the law
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
but this would is this clearly
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
significant just to the fire academy and
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get into another entity such as
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
the school department or any other
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
Municipal employment
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
well well specifically it's designed to
 
00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
assist the the fire academy with with
 
00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
the challenges they're facing but if you
 
00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
were to say
 
00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
all your hours at the fire academy don't
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
work that frees up more hours you could
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
be doing teaching if you if your plan
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
was well I'd like to do the fire academy
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
and I do three or four hundred hours and
 
00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:39.059 align:start position:0%
that limits me in teaching to 900 hours
 
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
now I can do you know 1300 hours
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
teaching because they're not going to
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
count the fire academy how that kind of
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
knock-on effect might might occur I'm
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
not sure but it's a possibility
 
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.810 align:start position:0%
not sure but it's a possibility
certainly

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
yes just to confirm in my mind so what
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
you're saying this could have a negative
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
cumulative effect if I did some uh uh
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
training at the oh I did some teaching
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
at the fire academy and then also worked
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
as a substitute teacher uh cumulatively
 
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020 align:start position:0%
that sum total could affect this
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
particular situation correct
 
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that'd be negative
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
it would allow someone to work more than
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
1352 if we're not counting the fire
 
00:22:20.159 --> 00:22:21.289 align:start position:0%
1352 if we're not counting the fire
academy

00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
academy
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
that might be positive
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
person will pick up more days
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
substituting about the school make more
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
yes representative gerhardt I'm just a
 
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
little bit confused here thank you
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
chairman are we worried about newcomers
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
not being able to come into the system
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
and work is that what the main concern
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
is that we can have part-timers at
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
retirees working and then keeping out
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
new people from coming in to take these
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
jobs up
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
I I think that's one of the concerns
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
um yes that people who are retired would
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
then be working full-time taking up
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
full-time positions from people coming
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
into the system and once again if the
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
system was fully funded maybe not such a
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
problem from that perspective because
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to we're not trying to
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
fill a deficit that we have and if it
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
was fully funded then then a person's
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
retirement would be mostly based off of
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
their own work that they're putting into
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
it but right now it's a mixture of the
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
work that they're putting into it and
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
additional funds coming in from from the
 
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
employers so and representative goalie
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
might be able to speak a little bit more
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
to that did you want to say something
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
no I just wanted to mention
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
that when I had asked during the public
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
hearing about full-time staff that they
 
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
had and they basically didn't have any
 
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:38.900 align:start position:0%
or they retired
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
relied solely on part-timers that you
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
know I think one of the solutions is to
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
get into their budget some full-time
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
positions that I think would be very
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
helpful in alleviating this problem yeah
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
and I know that they feel that way as
 
00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:53.930 align:start position:0%
and I know that they feel that way as
well

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien yeah thank
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and just to reiterate on
 
00:23:58.559 --> 00:23:59.750 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and just to reiterate on
that

00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
um and for information to uh
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative Gearhead uh
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
coming from that type of venue and
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
everything we were always very careful
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
to uh not get out there into double
 
00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
dipping think about the public
 
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
okay you're working as a police officer
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
or a firefighter and now you're double
 
00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:21.049 align:start position:0%
or a firefighter and now you're double
dipping

00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
dipping
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
and I think you understand the
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
negativity of that what that entails
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
here even though it may be for a good
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
reason and what we're doing is the boat
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
is seems to be sinking and something
 
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
needs to radically be done because the
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
training is of the utmost important it's
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
got to save somebody's life I understand
 
00:24:45.049 --> 00:24:45.059 align:start position:0%
that but the thing is they're asking us
 
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
to use a non-waterproof Band-Aid on a
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
leaking boat you know and I agree with
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
representative gooli the true answer is
 
00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
for the state to fully fund the academy
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be a problem in that
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
department so we're we're doing a
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid approach to this and I hope
 
00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:06.919 align:start position:0%
that against some of your point you know
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
understanding to this
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
sort of so it's actually cheaper to have
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
a bunch of part-time people than
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
full-time position that's basically what
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
basically yeah if you look at the app
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
because they're already compensated as
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
far as health benefits and everything
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
else right there uh let's say if they
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
work for their uh community so they're
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
not dragging that into the state level
 
00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:30.539 align:start position:0%
all right thank you yeah and just real
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
quickly representative what if you're
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
going to speak you still have to come
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
through me so it doesn't evolve into
 
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
chaos so you can respond but just ask me
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
to respond first I'll let you I promise
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
all right thank you chairman you're
 
00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.649 align:start position:0%
all right thank you chairman you're
welcome

00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any
 
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.430 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any
gut

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
gut
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
response as to something that you would
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
like to see happen I don't need a motion
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
right off the bat just
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
yes no in what way yes representative
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
can we put the provision for the sunset
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
clause in okay yeah I mean absolutely um
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
is there anybody who if we move forward
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
with a piece of legislation would be
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to putting a sunset Clause into
 
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.190 align:start position:0%
opposed to putting a sunset Clause into
it

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'm not a member
 
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee but um we still
 
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
value you thank you I I just like I said
 
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:25.860 align:start position:0%
have that concern we started with the
 
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
fire academy police academies on board
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
and then over the next three years while
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
this is going there's going to be more
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
people knocking at the door saying you
 
00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:36.419 align:start position:0%
did them time for us as well we're
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
struggling help us out and this
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
committee has taken a strong stance
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
previously on this issue and I think
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
we've been generous as a state as you
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
heard what other states are doing
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
allowing our retirees to work so I just
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
caution concern that we're going down
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
that road so
 
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
um once again so this particular part of
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
the conversation is mostly just about if
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
we were to do something putting a sunset
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
clause in or not just from your
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
perspective because I'd be curious if we
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
did move forward with it we put a sunset
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
clause in it it didn't seem to have any
 
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:09.539 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the state or how it
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
operated on the retirement system how it
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
operated would that alleviate concerns
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
about extending it potentially to other
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
branches or are we is it just on
 
00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:20.149 align:start position:0%
branches or are we is it just on
principle

00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
I think it's based on the principle that
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
we've gone forward with we're allowing
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
retiree people to retire collect their
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
full benefit and come back and work
 
00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
again for the another
 
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.010 align:start position:0%
again for the another
entity

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.510 align:start position:0%
entity
and

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
that could at some point affect
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
part-time job full-time jobs that are in
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
the system and that's the caution I put
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so I know that one of the concerns is
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to get people with
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
experience to do the to fulfill these
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
training positions most of them are
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
going to be taking a major step down in
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
pay in order to do it
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and so getting them to agree to
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
prolong their benefits in order to take
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
a step back and pay and stay on for
 
00:28:11.409 --> 00:28:11.419 align:start position:0%
another five six seven years to to teach
 
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes a tough sell so there's that
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
angle to it too yes representative true
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:19.970 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
we did we have anyone from the fire
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
academy here today yes
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
um maybe just a general question to you
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
um well you can ask him if you'd like
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
right now they're allowed 13 52 hours
 
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
that they have to put all 1352 to the
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
fire academy they could if they wanted
 
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.990 align:start position:0%
fire academy they could if they wanted
to

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.130 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the extra hours would
 
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:47.820 align:start position:0%
be good for
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
if they've already got 1300 hours they
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
can put the academy and if I may
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
just it's it's anecdotal but I was
 
00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
talking to a fire chief from a volunteer
 
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
fire department so he's full-time
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
um he thought the fire academy was very
 
00:29:04.679 --> 00:29:05.930 align:start position:0%
um he thought the fire academy was very
difficult

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:09.980 align:start position:0%
for his people to get training at
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
anecdotal he thought it was the fire
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
academy was basically for the for the
 
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
training for the full-time fire
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
departments who had cost constant need
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
to upgrade and maintain their fire fire
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
department skills
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
um but he was saying that it was very
 
00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:26.750 align:start position:0%
um but he was saying that it was very
difficult

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
he'd have to reach out months in advance
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
to get him or one of his some of his
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
volunteer lieutenants in for Advanced
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
I do have a little bit of a concern of
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh of extending the hours
 
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.090 align:start position:0%
uh of extending the hours
because

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
if 1300 hours Aren't Enough why would
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
sixteen hundred dollars be enough
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
I guess that's that's my my question
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
would you have anything that you might
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
be able to add to that from your
 
00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:05.149 align:start position:0%
be able to add to that from your
perspective

00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for that
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
question to be clear we train all
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters across New Hampshire
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
whether they're on call volunteer or
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
full-time about 75 percent of our
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
firefighter one and two programs which
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
are the initial training level are
 
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
delivered out in the field around the
 
00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:22.700 align:start position:0%
state and host departments
 
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
the struggle that this particular Chief
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
is facing is not unlike many others
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
there is a increasing demand for
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
training balanced with our ability in
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
terms of budget and Personnel to deliver
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
that training so that's that's what he's
 
00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.470 align:start position:0%
that training so that's that's what he's
facing

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
facing
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
and and to response or to respond to the
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
the total number of hours the 1352. if
 
00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
all of these retirees devoted that
 
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
entire amount of time to us that would
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
be very helpful oftentimes they
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
work in other part-time employment and I
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
don't track what they do outside of our
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
Academy that then
 
00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
eats into that total accumulation of
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
hours and doesn't allow them to work for
 
00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
in in stopping for the training levels
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
for the training hours for the fire
 
00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:24.769 align:start position:0%
for the training hours for the fire
academy

00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
academy
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
would you say it's mostly a small Cadre
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
of volunteers
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
that are well you get you have many many
 
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
volunteers to choose from
 
00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.289 align:start position:0%
volunteers to choose from
uh

00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
in order to get enough hours in for
 
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.649 align:start position:0%
in order to get enough hours in for
training

00:31:39.649 --> 00:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
being volunteer instructors yeah so we
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
do pay them they're a part-time per diem
 
00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
employees we have a large pool of them
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
and when we post a class when we have
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
any of our programs running we will
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
advertise the open instructor positions
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
and on a voluntary basis they can sign
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
up for those
 
00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:00.419 align:start position:0%
so we can't assign them to classes
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
because they are part-time per diem to
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative goalie's Point frankly it
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
would be a lot easier to manage with a
 
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
larger contingent of full-time employees
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
because we could assign them to specific
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
programs at specific times
 
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:15.260 align:start position:0%
that's just not how it's worked for
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
generation at least
 
00:32:21.049 --> 00:32:21.059 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
just one quick question
 
00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
during the covet emergency did the
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
governor not waive the number of hours
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
that members could work
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
so they could work an almost an
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
unlimited number of hours during the
 
00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:36.649 align:start position:0%
unlimited number of hours during the
emergency

00:32:36.649 --> 00:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
I believe he did
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
that increase your pool or didn't people
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
work more hours during that time
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have any specific doubt on that
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
but during that period of time the fire
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
academy like most agencies shut down put
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of programs on hold so we didn't
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
comparison between the wages that are
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
paid for the academy and maybe other
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
part-time work that they're doing within
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
the fire department in other words are
 
00:33:11.529 --> 00:33:11.539 align:start position:0%
they likely to
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
prioritize working at a fire department
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
somewhere else over the academy because
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
of a pay discrepancy I I don't have any
 
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
details on that that is a fair
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you again thank you Mr cutting
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.919 --> 00:33:34.789 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:36.659 align:start position:0%
I will need a recommendation at some
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
point from somebody
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
as far as how we want to proceed with
 
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.690 align:start position:0%
as far as how we want to proceed with
this

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think we're pretty much all
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
agreed that if we do do something that
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
there would be a sunset provision in it
 
00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:50.519 align:start position:0%
so that it could give it an opportunity
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
to see what would happen and then bring
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
it to an end you know so it doesn't just
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
go uninterminably
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
Um I think that would also potentially
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
ward off some of the short term of other
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
people showing up and knocking on the
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
door because we can say that we're
 
00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
looking at it and waiting to see what
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
the results of it are before we you know
 
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
make any recommendations for the future
 
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.129 align:start position:0%
make any recommendations for the future
but

00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
um it certainly is going to I think open
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
up that door
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
so that's something to take into
 
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.129 align:start position:0%
so that's something to take into
consideration

00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:19.730 align:start position:0%
consideration
um

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
the bill as it stands
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
without further amendment to it
 
00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.450 align:start position:0%
without further amendment to it
um

00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
of just
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
removing the hours that are worked at
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
the fire academy from somebody's
 
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
part-time working hours of 29.5 hours
 
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.070 align:start position:0%
part-time working hours of 29.5 hours
um

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
are there direct concerns I know
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative tree you mentioned a few
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
but other than that are there direct
 
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
concerns with doing that
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
with removing those hours out of their
 
00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
that's gonna be scared I guess
 
00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:03.410 align:start position:0%
that's gonna be scared I guess
um

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm assuming that nobody's prepared
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
to make a recommendation at this point
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative Davis did you have any
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
down at the moment actually I'm still
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
new to this whole system here so a lot
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
of it doesn't make any sense to me why
 
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
are there no full-time instructors
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
um just I don't know what questions to
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
ask when I don't understand
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
why the two entities or other entities
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
aren't treated the same inside the same
 
00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:40.970 align:start position:0%
aren't treated the same inside the same
system

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
so the problem that's before us and this
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
is always the difficult thing with this
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
sort of conversation
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have any control in this room
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
over whether or not they have full-time
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
people and and I think many people
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
probably agree with you on that point
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
but knowing that they don't have them
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
and the situation that we're in right
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
now where at least we're being told that
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
um hours to cover the instruction that's
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
necessary and they're looking for this
 
00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
to be at least a solution in the interim
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
to get them from point A to point B
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
um you know that's sort of the question
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at and you know we'll
 
00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:14.460 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision within that
 
00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
Paradigm right I think that you should
 
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:17.630 align:start position:0%
Paradigm right I think that you should
get

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
I think you should be able to give them
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
the amount of structures instructors
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
they need I mean if there are people's
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
lives on the line a few extra hours here
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
and there
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
I mean is it do do the other entities
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
that you're worried about
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
um have the same need
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
to be training representative Bowie
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
yes because you are also talking about
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
that would go to part-time police
 
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:43.849 align:start position:0%
that would go to part-time police
officers

00:36:43.849 --> 00:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
as well as part-time firefighters
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
working in District that we have held
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
firm on 24 hours so even in the towns
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
working part-time for those departments
 
00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
we've held firm on
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just I'm still kind of
 
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
um well here's what I'll recommend
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
because we have just a little bit more
 
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
time I think we've got a lot of
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
information today uh we'll give you guys
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
a bit of a chance to think about it
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
further we'll come back next week at 9
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
00 a.m does that would that work for
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
everybody come back next week at 9 A.M
 
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
and at that point we will actually have
 
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
to make a decision on this
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr and did we discuss the
 
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.370 align:start position:0%
I thank you Mr and did we discuss the
amendment

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
as far as bringing the police academy
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
into it uh we have not discussed it um
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
would you like to discuss it
 
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
um I think I have misgivings about that
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't know enough about the
 
00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh to speak intelligently on it but I
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
would think part-time people working at
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
the police academy which has full-time
 
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.450 align:start position:0%
the police academy which has full-time
employment

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
could have a negative effect on the
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
retirement system itself as far as
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
part-time people retired not paying into
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.450 align:start position:0%
the system
um

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
that's it so so I I had misgivings about
 
00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment okay uh
 
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions about the bill itself
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
but miss givings about the amendment
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
I would say at this particular point in
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
time I'm hesitant to extend it to the
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
police academy as well until you know if
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to move forward with
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
something I'd like to see how it works
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
in a more confined space and I'm sure
 
00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
that will Garner complaints if we move
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
in that direction eventually but
 
00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
um well we can discuss it further next
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
time but hopefully everybody feels a
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
little bit better educated on the topic
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
than they did when they come it came in
 
00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
give it a week think about it make some
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
phone calls
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
um get a little bit more educated we'll
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
come back next Wednesday and be prepared
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
to actually
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
make a motion of some sort so that's
 
00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:04.030 align:start position:0%
make a motion of some sort so that's
unreasonable

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
let's um
 
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
close up on 183 for right now then we'll
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
close up exec on that and I will open up
 
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.910 align:start position:0%
close up exec on that and I will open up
193.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
so in the case this has been recorded
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm representative Tony
 
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
Lucas representing Hillsboro 38 the
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
towns of Hudson and Litchfield
 
00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:33.829 align:start position:0%
towns of Hudson and Litchfield
um

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment which I sent to the
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
committee I don't see a copy printed
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
here and I don't have more than one to
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
amend part one and
 
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.470 align:start position:0%
amend part one and
um

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's up to the chair how you
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
want to handle this I can just deal with
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
that or I can go through all eight
 
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
sections again if you like or answer
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
questions or whatever you want
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
what would be helpful to the committee
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
would you like them to go through each
 
00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.150 align:start position:0%
would you like them to go through each
section

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
I think just yes representative
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much time we have left
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
message about 20 minutes maybe 15.
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
well the representative is testifying
 
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
I think I need to know the why why are
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
we doing this
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
um I haven't been able to figure out
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
much of the why
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
okay I can
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
at least briefly go through each section
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
and explain the why in general it's for
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
the most part it's uh
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
cleanup of some language this was at the
 
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
request to the retirement system this
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
um Carol asked me to to take this on
 
00:40:40.609 --> 00:40:40.619 align:start position:0%
and I went and met with them and this
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill is the result so
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
for the part one
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
um there's already a program where you
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
can have two teachers share
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
a job
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
there was some concern that the language
 
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear there were actually
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the original or current
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
language I guess and there were some
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
things that got appealed to the
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
retirement system they made some
 
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
decisions on that uh this supposedly
 
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
cleans that up and then the amendment to
 
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:14.660 align:start position:0%
this section was requested by the
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
lobbyists from the Nea National
 
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
Education Association and it act and
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh the retirement system agrees
 
00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
with it and when this was written the
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
idea was that I mean what this is is you
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
can have two teachers that share one job
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
and the original thought was that some
 
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
would be you know they've been on one
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
day or another day what the original
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
Bill didn't allow for is if they were
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
say one did the morning and one did the
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
afternoon because it was just in days
 
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
not hours
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
and so the amendment
 
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
um you know clarifies that and changes
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know which the employer designates a
 
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:53.700 align:start position:0%
position as a job share each individual
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
schedule worked 50 percent of the
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
regularly scheduled hours days or hours
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
in that semester for such position and
 
00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.750 align:start position:0%
in that semester for such position and
so

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
um you know that's what the amendment
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.450 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
um again it's it there was some
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding I guess and it needed
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
to be clarified
 
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
isn't yeah would you like the
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative from the retirement
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
Mark Kavanaugh from the retirement
 
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.349 align:start position:0%
Mark Kavanaugh from the retirement
system

00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:42:36.359 --> 00:42:37.010 align:start position:0%
system
um

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
the clarification here is that
 
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
job sharing for teachers is mentioned in
 
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
two parts of the statute one refers to
 
00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.770 align:start position:0%
two parts of the statute one refers to
equal

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
equal
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
the other doesn't so we wanted to clean
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
it up so it said equal in both places
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
and then we wanted to clarify what equal
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
meant the whole idea of job sharing is
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
without that provision you'd have two
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
part-time people didn't work enough
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
hours to participate so this allows two
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
people to participate
 
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:08.220 align:start position:0%
for one what is essentially one
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
full-time slot a full-time equivalent
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
position so we're awarding service
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
credit to two people even though they're
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
not working full-time and this is an
 
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
accommodation that the legislature made
 
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
for a common Arrangement that schools
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
have with teachers who aren't available
 
00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
to work full-time but can split a job
 
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:30.780 align:start position:0%
between two people
 
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
um and so we just wanted to clean it up
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
and then make it clear what what equal
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
meant because
 
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.329 align:start position:0%
meant because
um

00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
we thought well 50 50 is equal
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to say 60 40 that's fine
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
but if you get to 75 25 should a person
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
get service credit for only working 25
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
of the time so you know 50 50 seems to
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
be the best arrangement we're not
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
adverse to a 60 40 if uh if it provided
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
some more flexibility
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
so uh can we move on to two part part
 
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
two I think we can okay
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so there's some special case uh
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
things in the uh on the statute around
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
how the
 
00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:20.339 align:start position:0%
uh pay for extra special duty is handled
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
you know that's normally if you have uh
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know utility companies paying for a
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
police officer to be there when they're
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
doing work you know on the lines or
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
something like that it's being paid for
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
by a third party the thing here is to
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
clarify that you know if you have let's
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
say a grant from the federal government
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
or something else that's paying for a
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
policeman to do what he would normally
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
do as part of his job that doesn't count
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
as extra special Duty
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
um and that's to uh to clarify that
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
because that was ambiguous
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
any any questions on that
 
00:44:59.870 --> 00:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead and continue then
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
just came up in the context of County
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
Deputy sheriffs doing prison transport
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
for ice in the federal courts and
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
the county was mistakenly calling this
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
special Duty because they were getting
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by a third party I.E the ice
 
00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:19.140 align:start position:0%
or the federal court system
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
but that resulted in people working
 
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
special Duty during their normal eight
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
hour shift instead of doing Deputy they
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
would say okay you're in prison
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
transport now for members hired after 1
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
112 special Duty doesn't count and so if
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
that person is working two days a week
 
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
doing prison they're only working three
 
00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
days a week as a deputy sheriff and
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
that's not enough hours to get them into
 
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
the system and so we had to clarify that
 
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's it's not special duty if it's your
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
normal job just because money the source
 
00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
of funds came from a third party special
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
duty is the phone company
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
paying for a guy to sit behind the truck
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
well the guys are climbing the poles and
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
then you building them 50 bucks an hour
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
or something for that more traditional
 
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:08.300 align:start position:0%
concept appreciate that clarification
 
00:46:11.569 --> 00:46:11.579 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr okay I'll move on to uh
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
section three
 
00:46:16.609 --> 00:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
um and I I may uh I'll let uh just came
 
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:18.380 align:start position:0%
out and take care of this but basically
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
it's dealing with uh potential ambiguity
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
between the terms newly appointed
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
positions and newly created positions
 
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll let you deal with the details
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
yeah when this provision was put in the
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
intent was to
 
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.809 align:start position:0%
intent was to
stop

00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:35.819 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:46:35.819 --> 00:46:37.069 align:start position:0%
stop
oh

00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
prevent the
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
addition of new positions that are fixed
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
for point a point of our fixed term that
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
are exempt or have optional membership
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
the problem is one part it talked about
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
newly appointed instead of newly created
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
and created uh confusion as to whether
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
someone who was newly appointed to a
 
00:46:58.849 --> 00:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
pre-existing position had the option or
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
not and we're just clarifying that the
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
the option applies to any position that
 
00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
existed at the time the law changed it's
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
only newly created positions that don't
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
get the option
 
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.230 align:start position:0%
get the option
okay

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
you go ahead representative if uh if
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
people are happy with that we can go on
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
with section four
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
um this is a situation where somebody
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
was in the retirement system they left a
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
job they withdrew their contributions
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
and you know they might have rolled it
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
into a 401k Ira or whatever they did
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
um and then they come back and work for
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
a job that's under the retirement system
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
they're permitted
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
um to buy back that prior credit but
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
they have to pay the full Actuarial cost
 
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:44.339 align:start position:0%
the issue is it's mentioned in two parts
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
of the statute and in one place it says
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
they uh the minimum amount they can buy
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
back is six months service and the other
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
place it's a year and so the statutes in
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
conflict with itself and this just
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
straightens that out and makes it uh six
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
months in both places
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
so any questions from the committee yes
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative true thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
and so and thank you for taking my
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
question so what would it cost to buy
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
back six months
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
they would uh they would pay back what
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
they were given when they withdrew their
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
contributions plus additional interest
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
in the interim
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
now the reason we have six months is
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
that uh if a person starts working and
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
leaves the job within six months if they
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
take their contributions back we give
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
back the employer those contributions if
 
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's more than six months we don't give
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
them back so if a person comes back and
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
buys back and they give us their
 
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
contributions we don't have the employer
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
so that's why we that's why I had six
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
months the next time thank you you're
 
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.890 align:start position:0%
months the next time thank you you're
welcome

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas okay and I'll I'll
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
briefly say on on Section Five that um
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
this is to clarify
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
um you know who's responsible if the
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
employee doesn't enroll in certain uh
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
Provisions I will let Mr Kavanaugh take
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
this is what we call employer enrollment
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
oversight if you fail to enroll someone
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
when they're first eligible and that's
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
discovered later that person can file a
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
petition to ask to pay for the time they
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
pay their contributions to employer pays
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
their contributions
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
but they're not allowed to do that if
 
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
the failure to enroll was
 
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
through some fault or consent of the
 
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.790 align:start position:0%
through some fault or consent of the
member

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
and so this last section says creates a
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
presumption that it's the not the fault
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
of the member unless there is evidence
 
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:43.700 align:start position:0%
that the person person did
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
consent or the like and so this is we
 
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:49.619 align:start position:0%
want to say definite documentary
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
evidence of the person's election not to
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
participate so some employers protect
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
themselves by saying you're in opposite
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
optional position I want you to sign
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
this form that you're not joining and
 
00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's your choice
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
that overcomes a presumption in the
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
absence of that form it's a presumption
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
that it was all the employer's fault and
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
this is just clarifying that that the
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
election means the election of the
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
member not to participate
 
00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
so if there's no questions
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
all right can move on to section six
 
00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:22.619 align:start position:0%
military service credit
 
00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:24.050 align:start position:0%
military service credit
so

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
um first of all it removes some
 
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
redundant does a number of things
 
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
removed some redundant language you know
 
00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's just completely a copy of
 
00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:32.839 align:start position:0%
something earlier
 
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
and clarify a confusing current
 
00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:38.099 align:start position:0%
positions regarding what portion of
 
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
military service credit is free of cost
 
00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
and what Porsche requires the member to
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
buy it back I'll let Mr Kavanaugh deal
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
with that and also it deletes a section
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
um that's been preempted by the federal
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
military code
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't permit
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
um you know a certain
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
retirement things to be conditional and
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're receiving
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
military retirement so I'll let you take
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
the details yes so
 
00:51:08.089 --> 00:51:08.099 align:start position:0%
um there was some confusion the way the
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
statue was written before because of the
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
redundancy whether the three-year limit
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
on free service
 
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
was intended to apply per deployment or
 
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
cumulative over your career in the
 
00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.290 align:start position:0%
cumulative over your career in the
system

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:23.300 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
we felt that it was in our long-term
 
00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:28.619 align:start position:0%
inter long-standing interpretation was
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
that it was by career
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh recently a gentleman was
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
inadvertently allowed to purchase more
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
than three or was given more than three
 
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
years for free
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
because an old purchase from 30 years
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
ago didn't get make it through a
 
00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
computer conversion and so we
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
accidentally paid them for four years
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
gave him a fourth year because he had in
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
each of these multiple deployments he
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
had four different deployments
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
um he appealed and he won his appeal
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
before our Board of Trustees so we've
 
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
had to reverse and it's now a career
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
standard and our concern is that
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
theoretically someone could go out
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
and do
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
two years and 11 months stints
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
repeatedly through the career come back
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
and work for a few months for someone in
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
the system go back to the military
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
military in 30 years from now retire
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
with a 30-year pension but only actually
 
00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
worked for an employer for four or five
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
years was with the military and got all
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
that other time for free
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
um so I did a survey uh or I got access
 
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
to a survey by a national pension
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
Association that showed what other
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
states do you're not required to give
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
anything for free all you're required is
 
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
to allow them to buy back that time and
 
00:52:42.049 --> 00:52:42.059 align:start position:0%
give them their same job back while
 
00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
they're out that's the federal military
 
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
code that we're subject to as well
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
um some states
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
allow you to buy it back only if you're
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
not only discharged some will give you a
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
little bit some will give you some free
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
if you make a Congressional Medal of
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
Honor or a bronze star you get a year
 
00:53:00.609 --> 00:53:00.619 align:start position:0%
free but you got to buy it if you don't
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
and some just say you can buy it but we
 
00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:06.059 align:start position:0%
don't give any for free uh three years
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
is is the highest state I could find for
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
the number of free years given
 
00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:15.059 align:start position:0%
um so we felt that you know protective
 
00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
of the system uh that three-year wasn't
 
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate limit and in light of the
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
recent decision we need we felt that
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
needed to be codified
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
yes Robert no that's what it's for we
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
got we got three or four minutes off so
 
00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:32.089 align:start position:0%
got we got three or four minutes off so
um

00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question the three years free
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
is three years that a person was in the
 
00:53:40.079 --> 00:53:41.809 align:start position:0%
is three years that a person was in the
military

00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
military
 
00:53:41.819 --> 00:53:44.390 align:start position:0%
military
and

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
is getting
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
credit for three years
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire retirement system
 
00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:54.470 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire retirement system
correct

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
so who's paying for that I'm sorry well
 
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.329 align:start position:0%
so who's paying for that I'm sorry well
yeah

00:53:59.329 --> 00:53:59.339 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
it comes out of the fund
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
um which yeah if you could just a little
 
00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
bit that then gets reflected in employer
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
rates right just like anything if if it
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
employer rates or what pay for most
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
things and plus the employee
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
contributions so the the employer rates
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are variable based on
 
00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:20.339 align:start position:0%
liabilities and so that they
 
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:22.980 align:start position:0%
theoretically we'd go up some amount
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
based on the free service right so the
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
bottom line is it's all the to all the
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers Is Where It
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
ultimately comes from
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah go ahead representative it's
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
not um so it's not that
 
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
the the employer the town is not being
 
00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
charged twenty thousand dollars no right
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
now no it's reflected in the future
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
rates correct right all right thank you
 
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:50.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
and for the purpose of this bill
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
obviously too we're not instituting that
 
00:54:58.609 --> 00:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
it already exists more expansively so
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
right um I'll deal with seven and eight
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
together they're both a situation where
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
there was exactly duplicate language in
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
two places that there was no need for
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
and that just um you know cleans things
 
00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.270 align:start position:0%
and that just um you know cleans things
up

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
right and then if I'm going to nine and
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
the last one yep
 
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.450 align:start position:0%
the last one yep
um

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
in statute there are requirements that
 
00:55:24.059 --> 00:55:25.970 align:start position:0%
in statute there are requirements that
um

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:28.220 align:start position:0%
that the retirement system
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
follows certain standards
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
um Governor govern uh government
 
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:36.059 align:start position:0%
Accounting Standards Board gisb and the
 
00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
problem is the name has changed and so
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
it's just necessary to change the name
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
and statute to reflect the current name
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's all it is
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
thank you and that's it
 
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
and and what I uh what I'm asking uh the
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommend is to adopt the
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
amendment clarifying you know that the
 
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
teachers can share
 
00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
hours rather than only days because our
 
00:56:03.049 --> 00:56:03.059 align:start position:0%
situations were teach you know one
 
00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
person may be free in the morning and
 
00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
then they may have to do child care you
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
know take care of their kids or
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
something in the afternoon another one
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
it could be the other way around and
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
this permits that to happen and for them
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
still to be in the retirement system
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you so much appreciate you coming
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
um we're about five minutes till 10 when
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
the regular committee work is going to
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
start up so uh
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to discuss this today
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
we'll come back next Wednesday at 9 00
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
a.m and um we'll exec both
 
00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
um both of the subcommittee bills yes
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you Mr
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
chair so do we have to does the
 
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:39.900 align:start position:0%

00:57:26.089 --> 00:57:26.099 align:start position:0%
Bill probably will need a little bit of
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
time next week to deal with that
 
00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:28.849 align:start position:0%
time next week to deal with that
um

00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:28.859 align:start position:0%

thank you for joining us
 
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
perennial joke
 
01:02:59.210 --> 01:02:59.220 align:start position:0%
he also does both the same way I do
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Jordan ulery
 
01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:07.079 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro 13. I had the uh
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
honor of serving on an oplc uh
 
01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.630 align:start position:0%
honor of serving on an oplc uh
Commission

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
studying the issues regarding the
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
operation of oplc over this past summer
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
representing Ways and Means along with
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
now Senator Lang
 
01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.970 align:start position:0%
now Senator Lang
uh

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
one of the problems we found was is that
 
01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
under the structure of New Hampshire law
 
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
you have to expend your Monies
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:39.180 align:start position:0%
and then spending those monies if you
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
need extra money you have to take from
 
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
here which then
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
increases the cost that you're going to
 
01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:46.740 align:start position:0%
assess to the members
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
who have licenses under the fee
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
structure of oplc
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
what was determined from the commission
 
01:03:58.069 --> 01:03:58.079 align:start position:0%
was that a float was needed if you will
 
01:03:58.079 --> 01:04:00.109 align:start position:0%
was that a float was needed if you will
ah

01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
the derogatory term is slush fund but in
 
01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.970 align:start position:0%
the derogatory term is slush fund but in
fact

01:04:04.970 --> 01:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
it's a fund where you can take monies
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
from here put it over here and then it
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
comes back into here again
 
01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.670 align:start position:0%
comes back into here again
this

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
bill that we're permit uh submitting is
 
01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:18.410 align:start position:0%
bill that we're permit uh submitting is
changes

01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
the funding from the fees from a lapsing
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
fund to a non-lapsing fund and then it
 
01:04:27.049 --> 01:04:27.059 align:start position:0%
specifies the purposes for which those
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh non-lapsing funds are used and only
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
for those purposes
 
01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:34.619 align:start position:0%
so it's it's one of the more simple
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
bills it has to go through this
 
01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee for policy and then it goes to
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
ways and means and I can see one or two
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
modifications being made in ways and
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
means but the general policy is if we
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
establish a non-lapsing fund
 
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
then oplc has for example that they have
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
an investigation at next and they needs
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
to take place regarding
 
01:04:57.299 --> 01:04:58.670 align:start position:0%
to take place regarding
ah

01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'll pick one because they're up there
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
and no no aspiration massage parlors for
 
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:07.140 align:start position:0%
example are which so I'm sure some
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
people will immediately complain about
 
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.190 align:start position:0%
people will immediately complain about
but

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
um if they need to investigate the
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
licensees operation they need to hire
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
either a private investigator or or
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
another person to go out it takes time
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
from their budget or operating budget
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
this will go out to that and come back
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
in and then it does not have to raise
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
the fees of every
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
license holder in order to pay for the
 
01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:34.619 align:start position:0%
expenditure to investigate this one
 
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
particular group over here or one
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
particular license holder over there
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's that's a just an example it's not
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
I mean it could be a t it could be a a
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
doctor or it could be uh any one of the
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
other licensed agencies a psychiatrist
 
01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.470 align:start position:0%
other licensed agencies a psychiatrist
uh

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
one of the we did learn that uh
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
Midwifery is one of the ones that all
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
everyone complains about for some reason
 
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:05.339 align:start position:0%
I have no idea why uh I I worked with
 
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
midwives in the field and they're
 
01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
but you know it is what it is
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
but that's it's a simple bill
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
and the idea is to make oplc work better
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
what we did do and what Edna is now
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
we had a variety of different sections
 
01:06:29.809 --> 01:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
we divided that up this is the first
 
01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:30.770 align:start position:0%
we divided that up this is the first
part

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:30.780 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
you have a much larger bill
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
coming forward uh that will need some
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
greater discussion
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:42.059 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has a question
 
01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt does have a
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
question representative Schmidt
 
01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good to see you
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
Jordan uh so tell me this is uh you're
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill at the request of the
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
about PLC or is this uh I see you've got
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of people on the bill with you so
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
the origin of the bill is your own idea
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
or is it a request of the agency
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
a combination of the agency are coming
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
to the commission and saying we need
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
some help this is an idea the
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
commission's sitting down saying yeah it
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
looks like it's a pretty good idea and
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
that was a bipartisan commission you
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
know it was chaired by Senator Carson
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
but uh uh representing Merchant was on
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
it and uh uh with me and I don't
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%

01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
definitely bipartisan thank you
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
not seeing anyone thank you

foreign thank you Mr chairman for the
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%

Pearson I chair health human no I don't

get to the right room each time though I
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
I'm going to speak in my role as
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Department of Health and
 
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
Human Services oversight committee it
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
was brought to my attention last
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
September a series of articles in the
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
Boston Globe newspaper about 20
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
malpractice settlements
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a surgeon practicing at a
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
why it was brought to my attention is
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
those 20 malpractice settlements and
 
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
other malpractice settlements from other
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
Physicians were reported on the website
 
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
of the Massachusetts Board of Medicine
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
but not on the New Hampshire board it
 
01:08:47.329 --> 01:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
was silent
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
so I appointed a subcommittee and we
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
looked into this uh had some meetings
 
01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
and concluded that while further study
 
01:08:56.809 --> 01:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
was needed
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
we could identify two sticky spots one
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
may be our rules in New Hampshire on
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
what should be reported need to change
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
but secondly we discovered the Board of
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
Medicine in New Hampshire as a retired
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
physician serving very much part-time
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
and as a volunteer
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely he can give due diligence
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
given all of that to the complaints that
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
come his way in other words we need to
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
have a funded position and why the
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing part of the money at oplc is
 
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
important is absent that we have to wait
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
probably until the next budget cycle
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
why should we wait when we really have
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
identified a problem why should we wait
 
01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:51.299 align:start position:0%
that long if funds were available to be
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
designated on an as needed basis that
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
person could be functioning now that
 
01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.510 align:start position:0%
person could be functioning now that
would

01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
answer the questions that constituents
 
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
are asking me and maybe some of you as
 
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
to given all of this why is the board
 
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
not reporting these things we should be
 
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
able to answer that and by funds being
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
available in a non-lapsing way we could
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
strike immediately thank you Mr chairman
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
 
01:10:22.679 --> 01:10:24.530 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for the
representative

01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:27.169 --> 01:10:27.179 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
so I understand the idea of the
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
immediate availability of funds and that
 
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
that is that that the uh the fund would
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
be made whole subsequently uh where
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
would that money come from
 
01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
is is that going to fall on the rate
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
payers in any way to repay the fund for
 
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
fronting and the money it's that is
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
needed I I'll acknowledge that While
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
others perhaps could speak with greater
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
specificity as I understand that rather
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
than having
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
a surplus of funds in oplc being sent
 
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund oplc could
 
01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:13.100 align:start position:0%
retain some of that it would not be
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
additional money and no less a
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
financially cautious person than the
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
chairman of Finance assured me I don't
 
01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
have any problem with that
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weiler I said
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
back so it would not be an additional
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
taxation on us thank you
 
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
um the chair would like to call
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.189 --> 01:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chair members of the
 
01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Lindsey
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director office of
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
before you today regarding House Bill
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
445 which seeks to modify oplc's
 
01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:13.219 align:start position:0%
existing dedicated fund to a non-lapsing
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
fund just to give you a historical
 
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
background regarding oplc's funding
 
01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:20.530 align:start position:0%
background regarding oplc's funding
mechanisms

01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:20.540 align:start position:0%
mechanisms
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
the my understanding is that the boards
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
prior to oplc's Creation about half of
 
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
them at least were General funded they
 
01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
them at least were General funded they
created

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
um or they
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
um they received Revenue through
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
licensing dollars which went to the
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
general fund and then they were
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
appropriated funds when oplc was created
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
their fund or our fund was established
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
as a dedicated uh fund and we were
 
01:12:51.050 --> 01:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
determined to be self-funded at that
 
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
time the fund was non-lapsing and then
 
01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter I believe it was the
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle the statute was
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
modified to make our fund lapsing every
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
two years or every year that was
 
01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
problematic for us because our Revenue
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
stream is is very inconsistent we have
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
most licenses were new every two years
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
but it's not
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
um on a consistent basis so for example
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
we have extremely high volume renewals
 
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
and December and June and so the lapse
 
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
every year was a problem so the last
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
budget cycle we modified the statute to
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
create a lapse of every two years the
 
01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
lapse numbers I just wanted to share
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
with you since oplc's Creation in 2016
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
was 4.7 million dollars in 2017 5.5
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 2018 5.5 million
 
01:13:57.010 --> 01:13:57.020 align:start position:0%
dollars 2019 there wasn't a lapse
 
01:14:00.649 --> 01:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
2020 there was a lapse of 6.9 that was
 
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
for the two years and last year 2021 we
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
lapsed about four million dollars the
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
problem with this is that licensee
 
01:14:10.010 --> 01:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
dollars were completely self-funded
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
licensee dollars are supposed to be used
 
01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
for license licensing purposes and not
 
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
for any other purpose and if you look at
 
01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
the the numbers that we've been lapsing
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's been significantly over that 125
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
percent threshold and personally it's
 
01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's concerning to me that it
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
essentially we could be taxing
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and I think that was the
 
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
finding of the committee that was
 
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:37.100 align:start position:0%
established last year by Senate Bill 330
 
01:14:39.649 --> 01:14:39.659 align:start position:0%
and essentially why the recommendation
 
01:14:42.169 --> 01:14:42.179 align:start position:0%
was made to make our fund a non-lapsing
 
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
fund there are some directives in the
 
01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
bill which we fully support which is
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
that the remaining funds could only be
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
used for Capital expenditures or to
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
reduce licensing fees right now we
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to modify licensing
 
01:14:59.090 --> 01:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
fees there's a separate bill going
 
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
through that you may see to make clear
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
that oplc has the authority to establish
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
fees and rn10 is to level set all the
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
fees right now we have individuals or
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
boards that are not paying their their
 
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
fair share they're not meeting their
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
costs and we have other boards that are
 
01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
completely overpaying and we need we
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
need to level set that but we also need
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
to have funding available in order to
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
support the licensees and with that I'd
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions for
 
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
the director yes representative Gerhard
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman what would you say
 
01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:37.020 align:start position:0%
supporting the licensees includes is
 
01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
that oversight of licensees
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it could include oversight of
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
licensees but for example one of I think
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
you've seen the Dental Board audit one
 
01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:48.179 align:start position:0%
of the major issues with the Dental
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
Board audit that was cited was the fact
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
that our our licensing portal is
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
completely deficient
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
and that costs a lot of money in order
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
to procure that technology that
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
licensees can utilize to self-report
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
changes to self-report continued
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
education so that they um we aren't
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
creating barriers to Workforce by
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
allowing us to license people in an
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
efficient manner
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you all follow-up yes
 
01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:20.580 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you what would
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
is there any safeguarding place to keep
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
the licensee okay you want to return
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
money back to licensees if it's overpaid
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
but what's to prevent
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
your department just from creating
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
programs or more uh data driven whatever
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know I'm trying to get at what's the
 
01:16:37.970 --> 01:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
key what's to keep you from just
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
creating more infrastructure and
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy that's what I'm concerned
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
about yeah no that's I that that's
 
01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
legitimate there is obviously our
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
authority to do what we do is limited by
 
01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
Statute so if we were to create
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
additional programs it would have to be
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
statutorily authorized there's also the
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds committee that we have
 
01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
to report to the legislative committee
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is a dedicated fund and so
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
there would be oversight through the
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds committee
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Lucas
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't see anything in the bill but
 
01:17:11.689 --> 01:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that would limit
 
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
how large this fund could grow I mean I
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
I would expect that if it if it got
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
larger than needed fees would start to
 
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:20.820 align:start position:0%
be reduced but is there anything that
 
01:17:23.090 --> 01:17:23.100 align:start position:0%
requires that not in this bill I do know
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
that there was discussion about
 
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
potentially limiting to a an amount
 
01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.729 align:start position:0%
potentially limiting to a an amount
certain

01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:17:28.739 --> 01:17:29.930 align:start position:0%
certain
um

01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
we would certainly be open to that I do
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
know it's been my experience that that's
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
something that the dedicated fund
 
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
committee monitors how much money you
 
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
have in the dedicated fund and whether
 
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
you truly need the dedicated fund or not
 
01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
so is it not the case that the intent of
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
the the statutory solution or concept is
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
oplc is supposed to be self-funding but
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's not nowhere that I'm aware of
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
that is supposed to be a cash cow and to
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
the degree that the funds the excess
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
funds flow over instead of
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
being retained so that they can be
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
returned to the licensees so that they
 
01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
are not being overcharged for something
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
that is not necessary to fund their
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
their Co their coverage and their
 
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
their Co their coverage and their
Administration

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct so right now we are
 
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
our dollars are being utilized to fund
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
the general fund which
 
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
um is not the purpose of Licensing
 
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
dollars and it's concerning if that's a
 
01:18:44.689 --> 01:18:44.699 align:start position:0%
backdoor tax on licensees and so this is
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
intended to really remedy that problem
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
I just have
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
one so
 
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
um do you have any recommendations uh as
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
far as
 
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
limiting the funds like as
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
representative likos was saying there's
 
01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:10.219 align:start position:0%
no cap to this so as funds go up
 
01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:12.659 align:start position:0%
requiring that they be applied to
 
01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
certain things
 
01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and a certain percentage or you know
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
certain amount
 
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
um so I think the figure that and
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
somebody can correct me if I'm wrong the
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
figure that was discussed at the
 
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
committee or at the commission was five
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars the things that come to
 
01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
mind are really technology
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
that costs money in order to procure and
 
01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
the the problem with you know you don't
 
01:19:40.729 --> 01:19:40.739 align:start position:0%
want to completely change licensing fees
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
every time you need to do a procurement
 
01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.030 align:start position:0%
every time you need to do a procurement
um

01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'd have to give some more thought to
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
that but five million dollars is
 
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
certainly reasonable for us um you know
 
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
that's about a year and a half's worth
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
of an existing lapse right now which
 
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
would mean that we wouldn't have to
 
01:19:57.169 --> 01:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
modify licensing fees
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
um we will modify licensing fees as
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
noted because some people are paying too
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
much and others aren't enough but
 
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
assuming we didn't
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
um that would be about a year and a
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
half's worth of savings if you will
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas thank you um do
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
you have some general
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
guess as to the cost of some of these
 
01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
I.T infrastructure projects as I imagine
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
you might want to let that build up so
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
you had enough money to pay for it I'm
 
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
wondering how much that might be yeah so
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
the contract that was just approved by
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
governor and Council we thankfully were
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
able to get some arpa funding for that
 
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
and that funding is about 3.8 million
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
dollars I think that should be
 
01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
sufficient to at least get us migrated
 
01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:39.260 align:start position:0%
to a new system
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
but in terms of upgrading additional I.T
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
costs I'm not sure additionally that
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
contract is limited to a certain number
 
01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
of license types and so every time the
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
legislation or the rules change to
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
create or modify license types it
 
01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
requires additional development work
 
01:20:58.910 --> 01:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerard just a quick
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman the so some
 
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
licensees are more expensive to monitor
 
01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
where you say they're not paying their
 
01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
fair share
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
no what I'm saying is I mean so I think
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
your question is really how do we
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
allocate fees
 
01:21:16.189 --> 01:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
um and what is the cost of a license
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
um there's a whole discussion about how
 
01:21:20.450 --> 01:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
we allocate fees but generally the
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
shared costs we allocate to each
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
licensee the same so everybody should
 
01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
pay the same amount and shared costs but
 
01:21:30.890 --> 01:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
right now some boards when we allocate
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
those fees are not even meeting their
 
01:21:34.130 --> 01:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
costs I'll give you an example
 
01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:36.500 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and barbering
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
the boards used to have the authority to
 
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:41.219 align:start position:0%
set fees and some boards were being
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
subsidized by others and so there was no
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
motivation I think uh to change their
 
01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
fees uh cosmetology for example had only
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
charged 40 every two years for a
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
personal license for many years and the
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
true cost of a license is about 150
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
every two years so they're at about 40
 
01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
percent of their costs they also have
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
additional direct costs because they do
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
inspections as opposed to other boards
 
01:22:10.610 --> 01:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
so their costs are actually higher and
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
so we see other boards like Pharmacy
 
01:22:12.179 --> 01:22:14.030 align:start position:0%
so we see other boards like Pharmacy
accountancy

01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
accountancy
 
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.490 align:start position:0%
accountancy
um

01:22:15.490 --> 01:22:15.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:17.689 --> 01:22:17.699 align:start position:0%
paying more
 
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:19.860 align:start position:0%
um and the opposite and that's that's
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
the problem all right thank you
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:22:27.050 --> 01:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to call Stephen
 
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:39.950 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to call Stephen
rencourt

01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman committee
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
members my name is Stephen Rancourt I'm
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
a licensed electrician in state of New

Hampshire and um the executive director
 
01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
of the electrical contractors Business
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
Association the ecba and we're here to
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
support this bill in concept with a lot
 
01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that you've already
 
01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
raised in your questions
 
01:22:58.970 --> 01:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
um and I I do I have heard that there's
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a bill that probably
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
addresses that more about our concerns
 
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
about the dollar amount where it goes
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
what goes back to the licensing fee um
 
01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:09.060 align:start position:0%
licensees because it's kind of on the
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
tail end of the list where you look at
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
what they're going to spend it on and
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
again our concern as representative
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
brought up are we going to just add more
 
01:23:17.810 --> 01:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or more cost to use up
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
that money and never do it we would hope
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
at a minimum this would keep the fees
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
where they are because they were going
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
to have to increase them quite a bit
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
originally so hopefully this will help
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
if they do that it's important that it's
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
not it's non-lapsing because most of the
 
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
most if not all of the boards in this
 
01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
oplc are 125 we have been for a long
 
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
time so we create another 25 generate
 
01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
another 25 income for that and it's our
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
money it's not anything that's taught
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
the citizens paid for the tax pay is
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
paid for it's licensing fees that pay
 
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
for it and in the past you're supposed
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
to have that so if you have any issues
 
01:23:52.729 --> 01:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
one of our inspectors Kyle breaks down
 
01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
something like that we can replace it
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
but we've never had that ability it
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
always got put to the general fund so we
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
hope that this would this will make a
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
difference and help with all the issues
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
that the executive director has as well
 
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:05.900 align:start position:0%
as far as some of the infrastructure
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
the shared cost thing is again probably
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
discussed in a different Bill how they
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
come up with that
 
01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.430 align:start position:0%
come up with that
um

01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
the um we would hope that's something
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
like we mentioned maybe making sure that
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
a percentage of what was left went
 
01:24:23.209 --> 01:24:23.219 align:start position:0%
towards reducing licensing fees to make
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
sure it didn't get abused you know 30 40
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
50 or whatever might be left so they're
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
not spending it all on additional stuff
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
just because we need it but we also
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
would like to see the pay grades
 
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
increased for our inspectors we're
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
struggling to get inspectors right now
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
because the pay grade is not enough for
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
what's out there in the economy the way
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
it is we we're short one inspector we
 
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
can't fill that position so maybe things
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
like that can be addressed as well
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
whether it's in this bill or not or one
 
01:24:51.050 --> 01:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
coming forward but and I'll take any
 
01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.729 align:start position:0%
coming forward but and I'll take any
questions

01:24:52.729 --> 01:24:52.739 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:59.930 --> 01:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
so one of the issues that this committee
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
has labored
 
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
over for a long time is delays in
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
getting uh applications of stakeholders
 
01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
of licensees uh
 
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
dealt with processed expeditiously so
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
that in some cases it can be very
 
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
harmful to some businesses if they if
 
01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
they can't get their people in for in
 
01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
some cases a month or more
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh is this a phenomenon that your
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
particular field has suffered under
 
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
as far as not getting new people
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
licensed is that expeditiously
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that our particular field in
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
the electricians have done pretty well
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
with that we've been pretty
 
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
um they've had some technology issues
 
01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
which I know that the executive director
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
is trying to fix a part of this and the
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
funding is is the biggest issue with it
 
01:25:57.169 --> 01:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
right now it's not working 100 right but
 
01:25:57.179 --> 01:25:57.830 align:start position:0%
right now it's not working 100 right but
um

01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:59.629 --> 01:25:59.639 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
as we transition it's it's it's getting
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
better the initial change over to
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
electronic was tough
 
01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:06.709 align:start position:0%
electronic was tough
follow-up

01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman so uh
 
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're raising one of the cost aspects
 
01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
that we're also mindful about to the
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
degree that the agency is not as
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
functional as it might be because it
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't have adequate funding uh then
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
the ultimate uh burden falls on a the
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
licensees and their organizations but
 
01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:32.699 align:start position:0%
also on the people of New Hampshire who
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't get uh the service they need as
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
quickly as they as they would like it
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
and as they deserve because the system
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
is too sluggish because they don't have
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
either adequate technology or adequate
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
processing so uh you I appreciate your
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
testimony because this is an example and
 
01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
director Courtney mentioned already that
 
01:26:55.739 --> 01:26:57.010 align:start position:0%
director Courtney mentioned already that
their

01:26:57.010 --> 01:26:57.020 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:27:00.169 --> 01:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
revenues surf up and down and to the
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
degree that the elapsing aspect takes
 
01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
money away from them at a time when they
 
01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:06.980 align:start position:0%
ain't got it
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is not for the benefit of the
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you and if I may miss the chair
 
01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:16.139 align:start position:0%
that's that's definitely we're one of
 
01:27:17.689 --> 01:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
the few that it's been changed I believe
 
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
that was on a three-year cycle so and
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
our license were broken up over those
 
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
three years so if you took it in two
 
01:27:23.689 --> 01:27:23.699 align:start position:0%
year one year might be lower than the
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
other and it would affect it I mean the
 
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
director needs to have it as a whole
 
01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
picture and not be taking the funds
 
01:27:31.129 --> 01:27:31.139 align:start position:0%
every year like that to do it so it
 
01:27:33.370 --> 01:27:33.380 align:start position:0%
would make a huge difference
 
01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions yes
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
chairman the as far as the inspectors go
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
the pay is it indexed to inflation
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
I do know don't know the exact index I I
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
heard that they're hoping to increase it
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit come next year with some
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
increases but it's not it's not
 
01:27:50.570 --> 01:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
compatible with inflation if you take
 
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
that job right now that's why we can't
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
get anybody it doesn't mean what you'd
 
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:28:02.209 --> 01:28:02.219 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:03.719 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire did you want to
 
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
speak I don't have a pin card for you
 
01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.370 align:start position:0%
speak I don't have a pin card for you
okay

01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:21.649 --> 01:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair to follow up on some
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
of the discussion that had already taken
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
place regarding a cap on the funding and
 
01:28:29.629 --> 01:28:29.639 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
um this is a first this is a two
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee Bill a second committee bill
 
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
will go to Ways and Means normally in
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
ways it means we talk money
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
uh ad nauseam
 
01:28:43.139 --> 01:28:45.229 align:start position:0%
uh ad nauseam
so

01:28:45.229 --> 01:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking for the policy that this
 
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
should be set up at this at this point
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the details as to
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
whether or not a cap is necessary I do
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
agree and I will put in an amendment on
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
this bill when it goes before weights
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
and means in about
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
three weeks four weeks if if this bill
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
passes out up here uh affirmatively line
 
01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
passes the floor so about three weeks
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
after it passes the floor it should get
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
over to Ways and Means and I'll just
 
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:17.219 align:start position:0%
discussed with uh commissioner Courtney
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
and the 5 million cap seems to be
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable I don't disagree with that I
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
do agree with the cap understand that
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the bill is to provide
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
the operating funds rather than having
 
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
to renegotiate them over and over and
 
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
over and then reapply and say well we
 
01:29:39.649 --> 01:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
have to raise the individual licensing
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
fees which I used to be subject to not
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
with this office but with Department of
 
01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.729 align:start position:0%
with this office but with Department of
Safety

01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
now that's that's a process that doesn't
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
need to be done
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's a process it's an administrative
 
01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
process where you can take the funds
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
handle the situations that come up from
 
01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:01.139 align:start position:0%
available funds and then if excess funds
 
01:30:02.570 --> 01:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
are generated
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
roll those funds either back into the
 
01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
operation of the of the uh agency or
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
send them over to the general fund as
 
01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
you saw from the information that was
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
provided by uh commissioner Courtney you
 
01:30:16.199 --> 01:30:17.390 align:start position:0%
provided by uh commissioner Courtney you
have

01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
um three to five million dollars that
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
will be floating around and in the size
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
of our budget that's
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
not all that much money but I would be
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
happy to uh answer any questions and I
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
will assure the committee that I will
 
01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
put in an amendment uh five million
 
01:30:36.649 --> 01:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
dollars which is what uh the
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner has suggested
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:30:43.250 --> 01:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
for the representative
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
would anybody else like to speak on the
 
01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:49.910 align:start position:0%
would anybody else like to speak on the
bill

01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
not seeing anyone I'll close the public
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
hearing and without objection we'll move
 
01:30:56.689 --> 01:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
we are now an executive session on HP
 
01:30:59.639 --> 01:31:03.410 align:start position:0%
we are now an executive session on HP
445

01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative representative McGuire
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
moves out to pass second in by
 
01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
representative Grady uh representative
 
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
McGuire would you like to speak to your
 
01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:19.310 align:start position:0%
McGuire would you like to speak to your
motion

01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
is funded it has a dedicated fund but
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
due to
 
01:31:27.229 --> 01:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
timing issues
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
ends up accumulating enough that gets
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
lapsed to the general fund and so they
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
are a little handicapped and actually
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh having funds to take care of take
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
care of their
 
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
Improvement needs
 
01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
the executive director is looking at
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
license fees and I am proud to say that
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
in cases where the
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority for fees
 
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
was not there and a rule expired they
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
actually returned licensing fees to the
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
individuals because you can't enforce an
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
expired rule but some of the boards have
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
been paying too much
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
for years
 
01:32:19.490 --> 01:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
and we need and we need to give the
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have the flexibility
 
01:32:25.450 --> 01:32:25.460 align:start position:0%
to adjust the fees so that
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
the licensees are paying their fair
 
01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
share and not more
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that one of the reasons
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
they're building up a surplus
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
each individual board was
 
01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.930 align:start position:0%
each individual board was
um

01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
mandated to produce 125 percent
 
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
and the bigger boards did
 
01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
but that was
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
a number that when when you start adding
 
01:32:58.910 --> 01:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
up 125 for all the boards you end up
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
with extra money in in your pocket and
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
this will help to
 
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
smooth out some of those things
 
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you I hope I've made sense thank
 
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
you representative representative Grady
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to thank you
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
um for those of us who have been on this
 
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
committee for a while the discussion of
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
oplc and their fees is not a new subject
 
01:33:23.090 --> 01:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
and a commission was put together to
 
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
take a look at the agency overall to
 
01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:28.100 align:start position:0%
make it more efficient and bring parity
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
to within the organization and this bill
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
is a policy bill that does that and I
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to support
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
but anyone like to I would like to speak
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative likes yeah I think having
 
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
it be a non-lab scene fund makes
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
complete sense I mean having them end
 
01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
the uh end of the fiscal year with zero
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
money and starting over I I can't
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
understand how they can manage it in
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:55.139 align:start position:0%
um and you know we'll have complete
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
confidence in the current director who
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
knows what the future brings I would
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
like to see some cap but I'm glad to
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
leave that to Ways and Means
 
01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.209 align:start position:0%

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%

state house I'm going to ask to move
 
01:36:30.169 --> 01:36:30.179 align:start position:0%
those hearings to Friday because they're
 
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
all early bills and we really need to
 
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
hear them
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
to just just to warn you if the State
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
House is closed tomorrow uh we'll be in
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
on Friday
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
out the State House is closed last time
 
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
when it was closed on Monday they said
 
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.360 align:start position:0%
these committees are canceled
 
01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:16.270 align:start position:0%
these committees are canceled
Friday

01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%

01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
you like to have your supplement uh
 
01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can schedule it when
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
there's free time one day for
 
01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:02.270 align:start position:0%
there's free time one day for
subcommittee

01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
um I don't know can people make
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
we have anything Monday can people make
 
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:15.050 align:start position:0%
we have anything Monday can people make
Monday

01:38:15.050 --> 01:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:18.179 align:start position:0%
I will confirm that we're able to just
 
01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
move it up but one day yes
 
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative well Monday may not work
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
but we'll we can talk if it happens
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
I think that the closer we can come to
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
the scheduled uh time for the bills that
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
we uh would be hearing tomorrow if the
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
weather permits uh the the better it is
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
because a lot of those I have a couple
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
of important bills with people coming in
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
and and putting it off till Monday flips
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
the schedule a lot more than for the
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we don't know for sure
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be but I think your
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
attempt at dealing for in the unknown is
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
the prudent so thank you that those
 
01:39:02.290 --> 01:39:02.300 align:start position:0%
bills are important there's
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
six seven of them that we really need
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%

you've received from our community

and members of the Edna committee my
 
01:48:58.189 --> 01:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues it's uh an important bill
 
01:48:59.950 --> 01:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
that we bring you today
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with a real problem that exists
 
01:49:04.570 --> 01:49:04.580 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
but it's also something that we we it's
 
01:49:10.609 --> 01:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
important for us to understand what's
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
really at stake here so the in the
 
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
purpose of this licensing bill is
 
01:49:20.810 --> 01:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
protection of the State of New Hampshire
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire and the
 
01:49:27.250 --> 01:49:27.260 align:start position:0%
practitioners of legitimate
 
01:49:29.709 --> 01:49:29.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage
 
01:49:32.810 --> 01:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
01:49:37.930 --> 01:49:37.940 align:start position:0%
we have a situation here that uh it is
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
it's bad and it's getting worse
 
01:49:44.209 --> 01:49:44.219 align:start position:0%
and it's really important for us to
 
01:49:44.219 --> 01:49:45.010 align:start position:0%
and it's really important for us to
understand

01:49:45.010 --> 01:49:45.020 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
that the the towns that are being
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
impacted are suffering substantially and
 
01:49:55.729 --> 01:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
we will hear testimony from at least one
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
of the towns involved and I I actually
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
discovered that the city of Dover where
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
I live in where I represent Ward one
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
it also has one of these illegitimate
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
massage establishments so it's important
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
for for us to understand that we are
 
01:50:18.729 --> 01:50:18.739 align:start position:0%
actually involved in as I say protecting

01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
and it for those of you who are new let
 
01:50:30.050 --> 01:50:30.060 align:start position:0%
me just take a moment to to speak to the
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
aspect of Licensing because we we all
 
01:50:36.649 --> 01:50:36.659 align:start position:0%
have familiarity with our driver's
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
license it's it's given to us after
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that we have the capacity
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
to drive to operate on a motor vehicle
 
01:50:49.729 --> 01:50:49.739 align:start position:0%
safely but also an understanding of the
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
law with regard to using the public ways
 
01:50:58.129 --> 01:50:58.139 align:start position:0%
um and so this is uh this is not
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
dissimilar uh to what a therapeutic
 
01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.890 align:start position:0%
dissimilar uh to what a therapeutic
massage

01:51:02.890 --> 01:51:02.900 align:start position:0%
massage
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners do they have been examined
 
01:51:09.890 --> 01:51:09.900 align:start position:0%
they have been trained uh they are given
 
01:51:14.930 --> 01:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
a license uh reflecting their skill and
 
01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:16.639 align:start position:0%
their ethic
 
01:51:21.010 --> 01:51:21.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
this is a not a additional situation
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
some of you undoubtedly maybe all of you
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
have received emails regarding uh the
 
01:51:34.810 --> 01:51:34.820 align:start position:0%
fact that this is unfair to legitimate
 
01:51:38.689 --> 01:51:38.699 align:start position:0%
massage therapists but in point of fact
 
01:51:41.209 --> 01:51:41.219 align:start position:0%
and they say we've done nothing wrong we
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be penalized
 
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
but they've got it backwards it's not
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
that they are being penalized for for
 
01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
not doing anything wrong it's that they
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
are entitled to be licensed because they
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
are doing something right something
 
01:51:57.890 --> 01:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
legal something good Senate something
 
01:51:57.900 --> 01:51:59.209 align:start position:0%
legal something good Senate something
beneficial

01:51:59.209 --> 01:51:59.219 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
01:52:02.450 --> 01:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh so one of the aspects of licensure is
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
as you we all know in in the case of our
 
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses if you do something
 
01:52:10.370 --> 01:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
wrong your license can be suspended or
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
it can be revoked but one of the
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
important aspects of licensure is a
 
01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
license can also be denied
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
and that is the purpose one of the
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
important aspects of this bill is that
 
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
those who do not provide legitimate
 
01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:31.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
practice to the people of New Hampshire
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
who need it and who want it those people
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
can be denied a license because they are
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
not doing uh what the state provides so
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer any questions
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt are there
 
01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:53.270 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt are there
questions

01:52:53.270 --> 01:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Bailey
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
is this bill different in any way than
 
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
the one we had last year all right
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
I think it's slightly different in one
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
respect than that is it was brought to
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
our attention uh by uh the police chief
 
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
of dairy that uh that the bill has
 
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
originally drafted and that you're
 
01:53:20.990 --> 01:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
referencing that was presented last year
 
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
talked about therapeutic massage
 
01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:25.129 align:start position:0%
talked about therapeutic massage
establishments

01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
01:53:27.649 --> 01:53:27.659 align:start position:0%
okay but it was pointed out by the
 
01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
police chief that that the the illegal
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
practice that that many of the towns are
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
suffering from
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
um uh they advertise themselves as Asian
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh Bodywork or Asian whatever uh and
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
therefore uh that the bill might be
 
01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.930 align:start position:0%
therefore uh that the bill might be
technically

01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
technically
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
missing The Mark with regard to these
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
practitioners because it talks about a
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage whereas these
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
illegal operators are talking about
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
Asian practices or whatever
 
01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:09.179 align:start position:0%
um and therefore the amendment the
 
01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
reference that representative groder
 
01:54:13.129 --> 01:54:13.139 align:start position:0%
referenced is
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
um also a
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
deals with Asian body workers they this
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
committee about 10 or 12 years ago I
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
think I may be the one of the only ones
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
who is here uh separated Asian body
 
01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:31.460 align:start position:0%
works such as shiatsu Reiki
 
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
structural integrators and so forth
 
01:54:37.129 --> 01:54:37.139 align:start position:0%
separated them from the massage
 
01:54:40.010 --> 01:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
rubric because they said we're not doing
 
01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:41.510 align:start position:0%
rubric because they said we're not doing
massage

01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
massage
 
01:54:43.609 --> 01:54:43.619 align:start position:0%
We Don't Belong under massage it's kind
 
01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
of like asking a plumber to get an
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
electrician's license in order to do
 
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:48.950 align:start position:0%
electrician's license in order to do
plumbing

01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
plumbing
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
they don't they're not the same thing
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
they don't belong together so this
 
01:54:54.729 --> 01:54:54.739 align:start position:0%
committee and this and the legislature
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh did separate out all the Asian
 
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
practices uh and put them in their
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
separate section of the law and separate
 
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
governance separate board
 
01:55:09.709 --> 01:55:09.719 align:start position:0%
and so to the degree that the that the
 
01:55:11.709 --> 01:55:11.719 align:start position:0%
stat that the bill that we're offering
 
01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
addresses a particular section of the
 
01:55:18.649 --> 01:55:18.659 align:start position:0%
statutes and and the lawyers for the
 
01:55:21.649 --> 01:55:21.659 align:start position:0%
defendants potential he would say
 
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
That Ain't Us
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
so it's it's different in that respect
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:31.550 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
some some are here and some are not but
 
01:55:37.129 --> 01:55:37.139 align:start position:0%
my problem last year was and you kind of
 
01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
led me to that by saying what the police
 
01:55:43.490 --> 01:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
chief wants the problem here was
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
it didn't seem to be a licensing measure
 
01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:47.639 align:start position:0%
but a work a fourth amendment workaround
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
and you kind of went right to it by
 
01:55:51.890 --> 01:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
saying what the police chief wants the
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
police chief pointed out it's not what
 
01:55:55.970 --> 01:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
he wants he said the bill that we are
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
offering the unamended bill
 
01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:01.820 align:start position:0%
looks at therapeutic massage
 
01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
establishments and it doesn't doesn't
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
these Asian body workers does the police
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
chief have any association with oplc
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
does he have any associations
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know all right never mind thank
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
you I don't know whether he has any
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
association with it that's not the issue
 
01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
the issue is what is the town of dairy
 
01:56:33.169 --> 01:56:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.179 --> 01:56:34.370 align:start position:0%
 
hurt

01:56:34.370 --> 01:56:34.380 align:start position:0%

asking my asking
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
on there's one section that it says that
 
01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:58.189 align:start position:0%
on there's one section that it says that

which is fine but then it goes on to say
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
that if that person is providing
 
01:57:18.970 --> 01:57:18.980 align:start position:0%

well as I understand I'm not uh a
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
customer of I've never had a massage so
 
01:57:36.770 --> 01:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not speaking from a prior experience
 
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
but I do know that in many cases
 
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:41.229 align:start position:0%
but I do know that in many cases
um

01:57:41.229 --> 01:57:41.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
massage therapists perform their

their massage
 
01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.300 align:start position:0%
on someone who is unable to come to
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
their establishment so they the
 
01:57:57.649 --> 01:57:57.659 align:start position:0%
therapist goes to the home of the
 
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
client slash patient uh or sometimes I
 
01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
think they'll even use a hotel if
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
they're working out of town and so forth
 
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
so they may they may in certain
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
instances not be operating out of their
 
01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.729 align:start position:0%
instances not be operating out of their
usual

01:58:13.729 --> 01:58:13.739 align:start position:0%
usual
 
01:58:13.739 --> 01:58:15.589 align:start position:0%
usual
facility

01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
and and therefore
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
as I understand it they would need to
 
01:58:20.639 --> 01:58:21.850 align:start position:0%
as I understand it they would need to
have

01:58:21.850 --> 01:58:21.860 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
an establishment license but that's
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's a hypothesis of my part thank you
 
01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'll ask someone else representative
 
01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:33.830 align:start position:0%
I'll ask someone else representative

representative Schmidt I'm trying to
understand

01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:58:43.010 --> 01:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
the benefit to
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the bill and what and
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
Licensing accomplishing a goal Beyond is
 
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
it only for sex trafficking that we're
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill
 
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
labor trafficking as well yeah
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
trafficking though yes I think
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
trafficking is is involved but this is
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
this is to protect the people and uh and
 
01:59:08.570 --> 01:59:08.580 align:start position:0%
also the practitioners of legitimate
 
01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking in the state of New
 
01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:22.189 align:start position:0%
trafficking in the state of New
Hampshire

01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
it's it's that's not its main purpose
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
its main purposes but is to protect
 
01:59:27.119 --> 01:59:28.689 align:start position:0%
its main purposes but is to protect
legitimate

01:59:28.689 --> 01:59:28.699 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
practitioners who uh who in many in some
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
cases we had testimony a couple of years
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
ago when we first heard the bill that in
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
one of the communities the health
 
01:59:41.930 --> 01:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
officer was treating legitimate massage
 
01:59:44.890 --> 01:59:44.900 align:start position:0%
therapy as the same as
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
illicit sexual massage and and tarring
 
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
and tainting legitimate ethical
 
01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
practitioners of therapeutic massage
 
01:59:59.089 --> 01:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
by lumping them in with uh by illegal
 
02:00:02.810 --> 02:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
lumping them in with illegal practice
 
02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
is completely inappropriate
 
02:00:09.530 --> 02:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
so it's not just for the trafficking
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you

uh both sex trafficking and labor
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
trafficking Statewide uh in 2016 our
 
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary effort to combat
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
human trafficking was funded from the by
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
the U.S justice department uh and
 
02:01:31.729 --> 02:01:31.739 align:start position:0%
through that funding I oversee two Task

assigned to my office Statewide
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak today about human
 
02:01:51.649 --> 02:01:51.659 align:start position:0%
trafficking uh what it is our general
 
02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
approach to invest to investigating this
 
02:01:56.570 --> 02:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
crime and the threat that illicit
 
02:01:59.209 --> 02:01:59.219 align:start position:0%
massage businesses
 
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
um opposed to human trafficking
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
human trafficking is the use of force
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
fraud or coercion to compel an
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
individual into some kind of Labor
 
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
whether that's commercial sex acts or
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
any other kind of Labor we've seen it in
 
02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
the state in the agricultural uh
 
02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
industry as long as as well as the
 
02:02:23.450 --> 02:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
construction industry
 
02:02:25.729 --> 02:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh and and we investigate human
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
trafficking in whatever form it it
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
presents itself to us whether that's sex
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh sex trafficking is presented itself
 
02:02:40.010 --> 02:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
where familial or intimate or societal
 
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
relationships are present
 
02:02:45.410 --> 02:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
we take a victim-centered approach to
 
02:02:47.089 --> 02:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
investigating human trafficking that
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
means our ultimate goal is to hold
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
accountable the individuals who are
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
profiting the most from this sort of
 
02:02:58.669 --> 02:02:58.679 align:start position:0%
activity uh we we craft our
 
02:03:01.490 --> 02:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
investigative approach to avoid holding
 
02:03:03.770 --> 02:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
potential victims of human trafficking
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
accountable for relatively minor
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
offenses uh that have been committed
 
02:03:12.109 --> 02:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
incidental to having been trafficked
 
02:03:13.970 --> 02:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
human trafficking criminal human
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
trafficking cases are very difficult to
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
to make because we rely on testimony uh
 
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
and cooperation from the victims and in
 
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
order to gain that sort of testimony we
 
02:03:29.689 --> 02:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
have to overcome the dynamic that's
 
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
going on between the trafficker and and
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
the victim and that the the trafficker
 
02:03:38.450 --> 02:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
in these K the the victim in these cases
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
are reliant on these traffickers to meet
 
02:03:43.550 --> 02:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
their needs whether it's a drug
 
02:03:47.089 --> 02:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
addiction uh need or a housing need or a
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
food need uh
 
02:03:52.729 --> 02:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
in every human trafficking case that we
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
have investigated the victim is
 
02:03:56.330 --> 02:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
reluctant to cooperate with law
 
02:03:58.370 --> 02:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
enforcement as a result of these loyalty
 
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh these loyalties and out of fear
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
um though that type of dynamic is is
 
02:04:07.390 --> 02:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
present in our illicit massage business
 
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
uh investigations because we have
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
victims uh who are either foreign
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
Nationals or who are newly naturalized
 
02:04:20.689 --> 02:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
U.S citizens who have uh very limited
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
English ability
 
02:04:27.709 --> 02:04:27.719 align:start position:0%
the the jobs that the the ownership in
 
02:04:32.089 --> 02:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
these uh establishments are of that same
 
02:04:35.050 --> 02:04:35.060 align:start position:0%
uh ethnicity
 
02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh the employees are relying on the
 
02:04:40.129 --> 02:04:40.139 align:start position:0%
business owners for items such as living
 
02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
quarters transportation and even food in
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:50.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:52.609 --> 02:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
we've made criminal cases against
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
illicit massage business owners uh in
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
the past but they're very difficult to
 
02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
to obtain and we've done so without the
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
cooperation of the potential victims in
 
02:05:06.410 --> 02:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
these cases because we've been unable to
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
pierce that trust or that societal
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
obligation that the victim has towards
 
02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
the the trafficker so I want to right
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
now I want to dispel some a myth about
 
02:05:22.010 --> 02:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
human trafficking and and it's it's a
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
myth that we see in the in the media we
 
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
see it in in Hollywood if you've seen
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
the movie Taken you have a very
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
clear-cut example of human trafficking
 
02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
that victim was that portrayed victim
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
was was drugged and sold into the sex
 
02:05:39.010 --> 02:05:39.020 align:start position:0%
trade that's not what we see in reality
 
02:05:42.410 --> 02:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
on the uh on the streets what we're
 
02:05:46.129 --> 02:05:46.139 align:start position:0%
seeing is uh victims who are doing what
 
02:05:49.070 --> 02:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
they have to do in order to survive in
 
02:05:51.589 --> 02:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
order to feed that drug addiction or or
 
02:05:53.510 --> 02:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
in order to make a living and and and
 
02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
stay in the U.S so representative
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
Gerhart to to address your question
 
02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
earlier is this is this occurring
 
02:06:04.850 --> 02:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
between two
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
um consenting adults
 
02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
my initial answer would say I don't know
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
because there is that veil of uh of of
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
secrecy that's going on in these in
 
02:06:18.169 --> 02:06:18.179 align:start position:0%
these cases that I'm unable to pierce
 
02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
very often so if there's exploitation
 
02:06:24.169 --> 02:06:24.179 align:start position:0%
going on I'm not getting the cooperation
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
from the the victims in these cases
 
02:06:30.649 --> 02:06:30.659 align:start position:0%
um in order to establish that
 
02:06:30.659 --> 02:06:31.609 align:start position:0%
um in order to establish that
um

02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:34.729 --> 02:06:34.739 align:start position:0%
and to and and also my secondary answer
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
would be we have had juveniles go into
 
02:06:40.609 --> 02:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
illicit massage businesses and
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
um and and be assaulted frankly
 
02:06:47.030 --> 02:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
um sexually in in these in these
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
establishments so we we've coming from
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
from both both sides there we've we've
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
seen juveniles and I can't say that
 
02:07:00.290 --> 02:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
these are consulting or non-consulting
 
02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
consenting what I say Consulting
 
02:07:06.290 --> 02:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
consenting I'm sorry consenting yeah
 
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:08.810 align:start position:0%
consenting I'm sorry consenting yeah
yeah

02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:09.890 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
so one way that we address uh the human
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
trafficking threat posed by these
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
businesses is by Our Own federal
 
02:07:20.570 --> 02:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
um regulatory Authority I have one
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
Auditor in the state and he's
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh identifying these
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
illicit businesses and he
 
02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
um serves the appropriate paperwork and
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
he audits them for our audit Authority
 
02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that business owners comply
 
02:07:38.460 --> 02:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
um ensuring that business owners comply
with

02:07:40.070 --> 02:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:07:43.129 --> 02:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
um uh with with their responsibility
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
their their um lawful that that their
 
02:07:49.550 --> 02:07:49.560 align:start position:0%

02:07:51.709 --> 02:07:51.719 align:start position:0%
U.S and have employment authorization

have filled out for our employer
um

02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
the regulatory Authority in this bill
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
will help uh this regulatory approach to
 
02:08:06.649 --> 02:08:06.659 align:start position:0%
combating human trafficking in a
 
02:08:10.010 --> 02:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
victim-centered manner uh it will assist
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
us in our efforts to hold accountable
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
the potential trafficker and the ones
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
who are capitalizing from this activity
 
02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
and not the potential victim
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your time I'm certainly
 
02:08:24.290 --> 02:08:24.300 align:start position:0%
available to answer questions thank you
 
02:08:26.089 --> 02:08:26.099 align:start position:0%
uh this bill will be going to
 
02:08:28.129 --> 02:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so we may ask you to
 
02:08:30.470 --> 02:08:30.480 align:start position:0%

okay representative Dolan thank you
 
02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:35.099 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh and thank you for the the
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
work that you do my question is given
 
02:08:41.089 --> 02:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
the current porosity of the of our
 
02:08:43.490 --> 02:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
border situation are you seeing an
 
02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:45.050 align:start position:0%
border situation are you seeing an
uptick

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
uptick
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
downtick or about the same level of uh
 
02:08:51.169 --> 02:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
of problem that you're describing
 
02:08:53.450 --> 02:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
here in the state I'm seeing about about
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
the same I don't think that the the
 
02:08:58.129 --> 02:08:58.139 align:start position:0%
threat posed by these illicit massage
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
businesses are a reflection of what's
 
02:09:03.410 --> 02:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
going on at the border uh in in fact the
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh the employees at these in these
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
businesses are generally lawfully
 
02:09:12.109 --> 02:09:12.119 align:start position:0%
present in the U.S they um they
 
02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
they have a Asylum status permanent
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
residence status or even
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
um naturalized U.S citizen status thank
 
02:09:26.450 --> 02:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.490 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:09:28.490 --> 02:09:28.500 align:start position:0%

Fitzpatrick excuse me thank you madam
chair

02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:34.729 align:start position:0%
chair
uh

02:09:34.729 --> 02:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:39.530 --> 02:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
would it be accurate to uh Khan
 
02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
conclude that the victims have their own
 
02:09:44.689 --> 02:09:44.699 align:start position:0%
form of uh
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be a syndrome where they
 
02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
are under the spell of a of a trafficker
 
02:09:57.250 --> 02:09:57.260 align:start position:0%
and and certain
 
02:09:59.570 --> 02:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
psychological issues are going on and
 
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
they feel like they owe a duty to their
 
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh their employer I I would is that what
 
02:10:08.109 --> 02:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
you mean by stock follow-up yeah uh
 
02:10:10.689 --> 02:10:10.699 align:start position:0%
obviously they're they're being fed
 
02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
housed clothed and and just like a
 
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
kidnapping victim over a period of weeks
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:23.570 align:start position:0%
 
re

02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
re
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
re excuse me I stutter fruits who don't
 
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.609 --> 02:10:34.619 align:start position:0%
relationship with their uh abductor in
 
02:10:37.689 --> 02:10:37.699 align:start position:0%
in this case a kidnapping victim but but
 
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
the way that I'm reading what you're
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
saying they form their own type of uh
 
02:10:46.010 --> 02:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
stockholming Stockholm syndrome with
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
their employer in this case
 
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
I would generally agree with that I'm
 
02:10:52.250 --> 02:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
not a psychologist and I don't think I'm
 
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
in the in a position to make that kind
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
of diagnosis diagnosis but okay I would
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
generally agree representative Gould
 
02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that this bill that's
 
02:11:05.990 --> 02:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
really about a policy for
 
02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
um licensing
 
02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
massage therapists are is turning into a
 
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
sex trafficking but there's a comment
 
02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:15.659 align:start position:0%

02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
from your testimony that I couldn't let
 
02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
from your testimony that I couldn't let
pass

pass
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
having worked with victims of
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%

all of the sex trafficking issues are
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
about immigrants and that there are no
 
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
white rich powerful men in New Hampshire
 
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:39.540 align:start position:0%

02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%

being here today to talk about this
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
difficult subject my question is that
 
02:12:03.050 --> 02:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
how would you categorize
 
02:12:03.060 --> 02:12:05.410 align:start position:0%
how would you categorize
the

02:12:05.410 --> 02:12:05.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
businesses that you're seeing this sex
 
02:12:14.089 --> 02:12:14.099 align:start position:0%
trafficking in versus the multiple
 
02:12:14.099 --> 02:12:15.830 align:start position:0%
trafficking in versus the multiple
good

02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
massage therapy businesses that are out
 
02:12:19.790 --> 02:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
there in other words how how would you
 
02:12:22.010 --> 02:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
if you were to make a left side of the
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
column and the right side of the column
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
how do you identify these from a
 
02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
distance or from your trained eyes at
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
what you're looking at I spoke recently
 
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
to a town in New Hampshire that was
 
02:12:37.129 --> 02:12:37.139 align:start position:0%
easily able to identify them I want to
 
02:12:39.729 --> 02:12:39.739 align:start position:0%
know how do you identify and categorize
 
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
the left column versus the right column
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
please thank you yes ma'am that's a
 
02:12:46.609 --> 02:12:46.619 align:start position:0%
great question and I um I don't want to
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
get into too many particulars about our
 
02:12:50.569 --> 02:12:50.579 align:start position:0%
investigative approach to to
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
establishing this but we take a um a few
 
02:12:56.209 --> 02:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
different a few different steps one
 
02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
would be a report from the general
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
public or from the local police
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
department that there is uh commercial
 
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
sex activity occurring in these
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
establishments we would we would take
 
02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
certain steps such as
 
02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:11.209 align:start position:0%
certain steps such as
um

02:13:11.209 --> 02:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:13.050 align:start position:0%
uh looking at
 
02:13:13.050 --> 02:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
uh looking at
[Music]

02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.350 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
publicly available information to
 
02:13:22.729 --> 02:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
um to conclude that there's a a high or
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
a high probability that prostitution is
 
02:13:27.229 --> 02:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
going on in these in these
 
02:13:27.239 --> 02:13:33.050 align:start position:0%
going on in these in these
establishments

02:13:33.050 --> 02:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.970 --> 02:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
follow-up Madam um
 
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
just a brief one it's I believe he's
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
stated he doesn't want to give you too
 
02:13:41.689 --> 02:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
much information
 
02:13:46.970 --> 02:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
my my question then would be is there
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
any way in your experience that from an
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
ordinance standpoint with as you said a
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
report from the public a report from the
 
02:14:04.129 --> 02:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
police department things that are
 
02:14:07.129 --> 02:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
publicly available that could could be
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
constructed at an ordinance level rather
 
02:14:13.550 --> 02:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.770 --> 02:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't understand the
 
02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:18.950 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't understand the
question

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
may I clarify Madison
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
my my question is
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
is there in your opinion is there any
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
way to
 
02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
is there any other way to fix or fix
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
these problems without overlaying an
 
02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:41.099 align:start position:0%
entire RSA across all massage therapists
 
02:14:44.209 --> 02:14:44.219 align:start position:0%
by use of ordinance does that clear it
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
up yeah uh and no not not that I can
 
02:14:51.430 --> 02:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm happy to just to talk about
 
02:14:54.890 --> 02:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh Alternatives but I I
 
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
I can't think of one of my own
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gerhart thank you
 
02:15:02.930 --> 02:15:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
so as far as identifying these
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
businesses we received some online
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
testimony from various people one was a
 
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
owner of a massage parlor and I just
 
02:15:15.050 --> 02:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
read briefly from her email as an LMT I
 
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
cannot tell I cannot Oh weird I cannot
 
02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
being to tell you how many phone calls I
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
get in a week asking if I offer more
 
02:15:23.569 --> 02:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
than just massage I am buntly X if I
 
02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
offer Happy Endings I have no recourse
 
02:15:26.209 --> 02:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
with these calls there's nothing
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
misunderstood in the attentions of the
 
02:15:29.450 --> 02:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
caller I advise a call that I'm book
 
02:15:30.770 --> 02:15:30.780 align:start position:0%
style and they can call the following
 
02:15:32.689 --> 02:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
phone number then I give them the police
 
02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
non-emergency line as a therapist I need
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
recourse to have action taken against
 
02:15:38.510 --> 02:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
these callers when I called the police
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
they tell me that no offense has
 
02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
occurred and that and that no I'm just
 
02:15:43.970 --> 02:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
fixing it there's nothing that can be
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
done I'm being solicited for sexual
 
02:15:48.050 --> 02:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
favors how is this not an offense now
 
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to say that is or isn't an
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
offense I don't know and that's not my
 
02:15:53.569 --> 02:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
thing but if people can actively call
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
these places and ask for these Services
 
02:15:57.290 --> 02:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
is there really much investigation be
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
done besides just sitting with a Rolodex
 
02:16:01.250 --> 02:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
and calling these businesses do we need
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
this bill that's what I'm trying to get
 
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
it seems like these these businesses
 
02:16:04.850 --> 02:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
that are soliciting this are doing it
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
openly because she's receiving calls so
 
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
this is not something in the dark thank
 
02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:11.870 align:start position:0%
this is not something in the dark thank
you

02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
well she's receiving cold calls she's
 
02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
not receiving any calls from someone
 
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:19.669 align:start position:0%
not receiving any calls from someone
that

02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
any kind of response to any kind of
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
advertisement that she's
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
put out that would somehow somehow
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
02:16:30.589 --> 02:16:30.599 align:start position:0%
her business is
 
02:16:32.330 --> 02:16:32.340 align:start position:0%
engaging in this in this sort of
 
02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:33.830 align:start position:0%
engaging in this in this sort of
activity

02:16:33.830 --> 02:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:37.370 align:start position:0%
activity
um

02:16:37.370 --> 02:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.380 --> 02:16:39.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:40.969 --> 02:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm having a hard time
 
02:16:40.979 --> 02:16:42.530 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm having a hard time
understanding

02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:16:44.589 --> 02:16:44.599 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by the word
 
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
investigation a regulatory investigation
 
02:16:48.889 --> 02:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
or a criminal investigation because if
 
02:16:49.849 --> 02:16:49.859 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a criminal
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
investigation which is what my office
 
02:16:54.650 --> 02:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
predominantly does we do some some
 
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
audits but
 
02:16:57.650 --> 02:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
um I have one auditor I have nine
 
02:16:59.690 --> 02:16:59.700 align:start position:0%
criminal investigators
 
02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:00.410 align:start position:0%
criminal investigators
um

02:17:00.410 --> 02:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
on on the criminal side just that sort
 
02:17:03.719 --> 02:17:05.209 align:start position:0%
on on the criminal side just that sort
of

02:17:05.209 --> 02:17:05.219 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
um solicitation or and and this and the
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
the advertisements aren't explicit
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
they don't specifically say we offer sex
 
02:17:17.690 --> 02:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
acts they they they're just
 
02:17:20.089 --> 02:17:20.099 align:start position:0%
um they're known in the community
 
02:17:22.610 --> 02:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
um to to provide sex acts the word the
 
02:17:25.129 --> 02:17:25.139 align:start position:0%
word gets out so that but that in itself
 
02:17:28.429 --> 02:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
without an act we wouldn't be able to to
 
02:17:32.469 --> 02:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
if I may representative Gerhart I think
 
02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
he's concerned that you don't need a
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
whole lot of Investigation if you can
 
02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
just call them up and say you know do
 
02:17:44.270 --> 02:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
you offer sex and they say oh sure what
 
02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
when do you want an appointment
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
I mean that that would be
 
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know and and then what
 
02:17:54.410 --> 02:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
well then you've identified your uh your
 
02:17:56.509 --> 02:17:56.519 align:start position:0%
suspects right off the bat yeah but we
 
02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
way beyond our scope to be honest with
 
02:18:05.690 --> 02:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
you I think the
 
02:18:05.700 --> 02:18:09.589 align:start position:0%
you I think the
uh

02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for testifying
 
02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:16.849 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for testifying
today

02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:18:21.049 --> 02:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
we heard on the bills last year and and
 
02:18:23.690 --> 02:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
previous bills that part of the
 
02:18:27.730 --> 02:18:27.740 align:start position:0%
difficulty with investigating these
 
02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
illicit businesses was and right now the
 
02:18:34.969 --> 02:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
fact that it's controlled by local
 
02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances and we heard that one of
 
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
these businesses would operate in one
 
02:18:44.450 --> 02:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
town and if they were being investigated
 
02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
they would just shut down and move to a
 
02:18:48.129 --> 02:18:48.139 align:start position:0%
different jurisdiction
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that this bill
 
02:18:54.049 --> 02:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
would help overcome that difficulty and
 
02:18:55.570 --> 02:18:55.580 align:start position:0%
still be able to
 
02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.139 align:start position:0%
investigate these businesses wherever
 
02:18:59.629 --> 02:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
they go to
 
02:19:02.209 --> 02:19:02.219 align:start position:0%
no I don't I don't believe that this
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill would prevent them from picking up
 
02:19:08.089 --> 02:19:08.099 align:start position:0%
shop and moving moving somewhere else uh
 
02:19:09.849 --> 02:19:09.859 align:start position:0%
that's that's something that we do see
 
02:19:13.129 --> 02:19:13.139 align:start position:0%
uh and we've seen it as a result of our
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
regulatory action uh as well I I don't I
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that would stop
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gould
 
02:19:27.709 --> 02:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
do you think this bill will

morning my name is Beverly Donovan I'm
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
the economic development director for
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
the town of Derry
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to rehash what's already
 
02:20:43.130 --> 02:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
been said so I thought maybe it would be
 
02:20:45.650 --> 02:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
helpful to take you through our process
 
02:20:47.809 --> 02:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
to understand even how we can
 
02:20:51.050 --> 02:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the legitimate
 
02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:52.030 align:start position:0%
differentiate between the legitimate
um

02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
organizations that provide massage
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
versus some of the illegitimate
 
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
in the town of Derry part of my job is
 
02:21:06.410 --> 02:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
to get to know all of the businesses so
 
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
when somebody comes in to start a new
 
02:21:10.610 --> 02:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
business I usually meet with them we
 
02:21:12.170 --> 02:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
talk about what they'll be doing where
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be going and so on and
 
02:21:16.010 --> 02:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
I help them through what we call our
 
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
change of use paperwork which I think
 
02:21:20.110 --> 02:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much every town has this system
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that all of the Departments are aware
 
02:21:26.650 --> 02:21:26.660 align:start position:0%
of who is in business in town emergency
 
02:21:29.690 --> 02:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
contacts and so on
 
02:21:32.330 --> 02:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
um in that change of use over the past
 
02:21:34.010 --> 02:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
five years that I've been working for
 
02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
dairy we've changed that so that we now
 
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and this was partly because of covid
 
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
we now ask for more detail about where
 
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
people live and can be reached in the
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
event that shutdowns happen or so on and
 
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
we also ask for our description of their
 
02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
business and this is across the board
 
02:21:54.170 --> 02:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
for every business
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
um what we've been finding
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
um is there's just one segment of the
 
02:22:03.770 --> 02:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
population offering massage and there
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
are many many legit therapeutic massage
 
02:22:09.410 --> 02:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
businesses but there is a segment in
 
02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
particular and this is how they are
 
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
called out is Asian Body Works and this
 
02:22:19.010 --> 02:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
is starting to become an issue somebody
 
02:22:21.230 --> 02:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
had asked how you know well
 
02:22:23.469 --> 02:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
it's the frequency
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
when these businesses come in it's
 
02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
usually with somebody that they call a
 
02:22:32.750 --> 02:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
house manager brings in the person who
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
is then the translator for this person
 
02:22:38.530 --> 02:22:38.540 align:start position:0%
they sign up for that business
 
02:22:43.190 --> 02:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
and across the board it's been the same
 
02:22:46.190 --> 02:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
translator for we now have six of them
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
with a seventh on the way
 
02:22:52.429 --> 02:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
um when something happens when they
 
02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
by chance have an inspection because of
 
02:22:58.250 --> 02:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
a fire alarm or whatever the issue is a
 
02:22:59.929 --> 02:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
lot of times we find that they live in
 
02:23:02.210 --> 02:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
there their food is delivered to them
 
02:23:05.090 --> 02:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
they have no means to leave
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
and what will happen is the fire
 
02:23:10.610 --> 02:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
department will issue a violation they
 
02:23:13.370 --> 02:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
will have to shut down in almost like
 
02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
clockwork the very next week they will
 
02:23:19.550 --> 02:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
come in with a new owner
 
02:23:22.130 --> 02:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
um with their translator and this
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
happens over and over again in most
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
cases at least once a year
 
02:23:29.690 --> 02:23:29.700 align:start position:0%
um in one of our recent cases three
 
02:23:31.370 --> 02:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
times in one year
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
one place
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
um somebody asked about
 
02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
consensual I'm going to go a little bit
 
02:23:41.809 --> 02:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
deeper and say that in Dairy our zoning
 
02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow for money for sex it just
 
02:23:47.330 --> 02:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't and I don't think the state does
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
either so
 
02:23:52.370 --> 02:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
um I I just that's not something that I
 
02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
want to dig into but anyway
 
02:23:57.889 --> 02:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
um local police have no authority to
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
just go in and inspect any of these
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
businesses without a complaint and I I
 
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:04.740 align:start position:0%
don't think you're going to hear many
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
calls come in from people that had a bad
 
02:24:09.969 --> 02:24:09.979 align:start position:0%
experience at an illicit massage
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
establishment it just doesn't happen
 
02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
the calls that we do get are from
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
concerned citizens in one case we have a
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
condo development that backs up to one
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
of these establishments where we've
 
02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
gotten calls that the women that live
 
02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
gotten calls that the women that live
there

02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
um are doing laundry in a bucket in the
 
02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
back and hanging out their clothing
 
02:24:35.630 --> 02:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
washing pots and pans on the back deck
 
02:24:38.330 --> 02:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
these are people that can't leave
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
and these are businesses that are open
 
02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
till 10 11 at night for for what reason
 
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
one one of the calls that we got
 
02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
recently was because there was a lawn
 
02:24:55.309 --> 02:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
sign out with a phone number that a
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
citizen had reversed looked up the phone
 
02:25:01.250 --> 02:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
number and found a Litany of illegal
 
02:25:03.889 --> 02:25:03.899 align:start position:0%
Services being offered under that
 
02:25:06.969 --> 02:25:06.979 align:start position:0%
establishment with that phone number
 
02:25:10.730 --> 02:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
without shop licensure
 
02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
there there's nothing we can do to go in
 
02:25:16.969 --> 02:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
and regulate that with shop licensure
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
when these businesses turn over when
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
they come in with a new person to sign
 
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
up and say that they are the new owner
 
02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
of a business there has to be a bill of
 
02:25:28.250 --> 02:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
sale there has to be a new inspection
 
02:25:30.889 --> 02:25:30.899 align:start position:0%
that will help us it will help prevent
 
02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
it from growing
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
so really what I'm looking for is for
 
02:25:38.030 --> 02:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
this to pass to help me prevent it I
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
don't want to be in a position where
 
02:25:41.330 --> 02:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
we're policing and especially for
 
02:25:43.969 --> 02:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
legitimate businesses and I will say
 
02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
I've talked to a lot of our legitimate
 
02:25:50.210 --> 02:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
massage establishment owners who would
 
02:25:53.450 --> 02:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
welcome shop licensure because it gives
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
them legitimacy over some of the illicit
 
02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
them legitimacy over some of the illicit
businesses

02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:01.969 --> 02:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I want to touch on is
 
02:26:04.969 --> 02:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
with putting this in place would save a
 
02:26:06.590 --> 02:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
ton of money for the taxpayers
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
especially in my town where I have sex
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
it takes dozens of hours of the time of
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
our health inspector our code inspector
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
our fire inspector my office the
 
02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
planning office everybody who's involved
 
02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
in tracing and going through this change
 
02:26:26.570 --> 02:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
of use system
 
02:26:29.090 --> 02:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of time it's a lot of running
 
02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
around only to do it sometimes three
 
02:26:32.690 --> 02:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
months later
 
02:26:35.450 --> 02:26:35.460 align:start position:0%

02:26:59.160 --> 02:26:59.750 align:start position:0%
much for your time
um

02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:02.210 --> 02:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for Testimony there
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
may be questions are there any questions
 
02:27:07.010 --> 02:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
02:27:09.290 --> 02:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you director Donovan for your
 
02:27:11.210 --> 02:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
um my my question
 
02:27:15.290 --> 02:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
um for you is
 
02:27:15.300 --> 02:27:18.050 align:start position:0%
um for you is
if

02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
speaking about the fact that it this
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
bill would bring that beginning part of
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
the paperwork and the licensure and
 
02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
would give you a little bit more control
 
02:27:32.410 --> 02:27:32.420 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
changes to an ordinance such as living
 
02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:38.450 align:start position:0%
changes to an ordinance such as living
quarters

02:27:38.450 --> 02:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
quarters
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
in other words if I were to if I know
 
02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
that somebody's living in a zoning a
 
02:27:48.770 --> 02:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
place of business I would call the fire
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
department the fire department can take
 
02:27:53.389 --> 02:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
over from there so
 
02:27:56.750 --> 02:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's already against our ordinances to
 
02:27:59.510 --> 02:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
live in a commercial property it is
 
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
but we usually don't find that out until
 
02:28:05.330 --> 02:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
something else happens for example a
 
02:28:07.309 --> 02:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
fire alarm goes off and a building needs
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
to be reinspected that's when we find
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
those things out otherwise it's hearsay
 
02:28:15.170 --> 02:28:15.180 align:start position:0%
and you law enforcement won't can't do
 
02:28:16.969 --> 02:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
anything because somebody said I think
 
02:28:18.889 --> 02:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
someone lives in there you have to know
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
someone's living in there
 
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would be harassment
 
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
and our police chief is 100 percent
 
02:28:28.790 --> 02:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
behind this passage of this as well as
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
other Chiefs that um he has spoken to
 
02:28:31.800 --> 02:28:33.469 align:start position:0%
other Chiefs that um he has spoken to
and

02:28:33.469 --> 02:28:33.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's an important piece
 
02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gerhart
 
02:28:41.090 --> 02:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I mean I believe
 
02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
the Bill's intentions are noble but I
 
02:28:44.990 --> 02:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
mean the opposition at least on emails
 
02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
has been pretty heavy so the the concern
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
I have always is it that hard to find
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
someone that speaks Chinese to solicit
 
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
these services to go into these
 
02:28:56.210 --> 02:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
establishments to then figure out what's
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
going on and then just to be done with
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
it I just I don't I'm misunderstanding
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
well I guess I would ask what would the
 
02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
authority to do that be
 
02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
they have their translator I can have an
 
02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
app on my phone I have done that gone in
 
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
and just to say hello as I do with many
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
other businesses in town
 
02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:29:20.330 --> 02:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
you can't just go in there and inspect a
 
02:29:21.889 --> 02:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
business no more than you could do a
 
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
bead shop or so on just because you feel
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
like going in there to inspect follow
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
please well I mean with let's say crack
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
houses trap houses where we want to call
 
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
them you go in there say hey can I have
 
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
some crack they give it to you and then
 
02:29:37.010 --> 02:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
you arrest them for said service do you
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
know what I mean I don't see why that
 
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
couldn't be done I'm just confused here
 
02:29:45.650 --> 02:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh well I guess under what Authority
 
02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
just because you think you know
 
02:29:49.130 --> 02:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
something doesn't mean that you do know
 
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
something so it would be considered
 
02:29:53.270 --> 02:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
harassment to go in and do something
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:29:56.570 --> 02:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure probably Homeland Security
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
or if if the police chief would hear
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
they they could go into that I'm not in
 
02:30:03.650 --> 02:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
law enforcement myself but I know that
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
we have met with several agencies over
 
02:30:09.889 --> 02:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
the past several years including
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security multiple agencies to
 
02:30:16.429 --> 02:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
try to figure this out and what the best
 
02:30:19.550 --> 02:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
option for us always as it comes up is
 
02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:21.590 align:start position:0%
option for us always as it comes up is
prevention

02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
and prevention in the sense that if you
 
02:30:26.990 --> 02:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
require shop licensure
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
then that's an opportunity for the oplc
 
02:30:32.809 --> 02:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
to go in there at the get-go and license
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
that shop when that shop goes out of
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
business or sells then that happens
 
02:30:40.010 --> 02:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
again and you have another opportunity
 
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
to go in there and I won't get into the
 
02:30:44.809 --> 02:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
details of what when these types of
 
02:30:49.130 --> 02:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
it you know it results in in people
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
either moving on or
 
02:30:57.650 --> 02:30:57.660 align:start position:0%
you know closing up and bringing in the
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
new owner
 
02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up last follow-up well wouldn't
 
02:31:03.290 --> 02:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
prevention also consist of dealing with
 
02:31:06.050 --> 02:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
members of the community who are
 
02:31:06.060 --> 02:31:06.889 align:start position:0%
members of the community who are
um

02:31:06.889 --> 02:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:08.809 --> 02:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
frequenting these establishments I mean
 
02:31:10.910 --> 02:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that kind of play into it just
 
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
dealing with that issue and bringing
 
02:31:13.370 --> 02:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
that to the Forefront of the community
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
hey you know guys it's not a good idea
 
02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
maybe we should discuss this and or is
 
02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
it people from outside the community or
 
02:31:21.410 --> 02:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
is it it's a little of everything and I
 
02:31:23.330 --> 02:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
I will say you know from an economic
 
02:31:25.250 --> 02:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
development standpoint
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
um in certain areas strip malls where
 
02:31:30.469 --> 02:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
these occur I have had calls from the
 
02:31:32.389 --> 02:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
neighboring businesses too that are very
 
02:31:33.770 --> 02:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
concerned because they see the
 
02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
trafficking one actually did decide one
 
02:31:38.510 --> 02:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
summer day to sit out in a lawn chair in
 
02:31:40.849 --> 02:31:40.859 align:start position:0%
front and say to every person who walked
 
02:31:42.889 --> 02:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
by hey how is it in there
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
just to deter it but they shouldn't be
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
in that position these establishments
 
02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
should not be able to hurt the
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
02:31:59.450 --> 02:31:59.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Charlie Pendle
 
02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:14.090 --> 02:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
Kendall Brewery
 
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members of the
 
02:32:21.710 --> 02:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Charlie pendleberry
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a detective with the Merrimack
 
02:32:25.849 --> 02:32:25.859 align:start position:0%
County Sheriff's Office and I was
 
02:32:28.250 --> 02:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to be a member of the
 
02:32:29.809 --> 02:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire human trafficking task
 
02:32:32.809 --> 02:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
force and investigate uh both sex and
 
02:32:34.750 --> 02:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
labor trafficking
 
02:32:38.210 --> 02:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
as already discussed by rack pazanka
 
02:32:40.370 --> 02:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
these cases have proved to be very
 
02:32:42.889 --> 02:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
difficult and I just really want to
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
reinforce and Echo what he's already
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
been said I think a lot of the important
 
02:32:48.410 --> 02:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
points have been touched upon and
 
02:32:50.570 --> 02:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
discussed but
 
02:32:52.849 --> 02:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
um representative Gould you um you asked
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
about basically state law correct so I
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to touch on uh about two points
 
02:33:02.510 --> 02:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:05.570 --> 02:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
um state law enforcement has two rsas at
 
02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
our disposal basically for this New
 
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA 6337 which deals with
 
02:33:12.889 --> 02:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
trafficking in persons and then New
 
02:33:16.370 --> 02:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire RSA 6452 which is prostitution
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
and such related offenses
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh the issue is is that this would mean
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
we would have to criminally charge the
 
02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:25.969 align:start position:0%
we would have to criminally charge the
workers

02:33:25.969 --> 02:33:25.979 align:start position:0%
workers
 
02:33:28.309 --> 02:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
who are believed to be victims of
 
02:33:30.050 --> 02:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
trafficking in these cases and as
 
02:33:31.190 --> 02:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
already discussed with the
 
02:33:33.050 --> 02:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
victim-centered approach we do not want
 
02:33:34.490 --> 02:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
to be charging victims of human
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking with prostitution
 
02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
um it's counter-intuitive
 
02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
and potentially harmful to the
 
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:42.950 align:start position:0%
and potentially harmful to the
individual

02:33:42.950 --> 02:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:33:45.770 --> 02:33:45.780 align:start position:0%
therefore again as it really touched
 
02:33:47.210 --> 02:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
upon our goals to hold the person
 
02:33:49.010 --> 02:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
profiting accountable
 
02:33:51.170 --> 02:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
if this can be done under New Hampshire
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
RSA 645 to the Penalty is only a
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and there's low
 
02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:59.570 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and there's low
accountability

02:33:59.570 --> 02:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.809 --> 02:34:02.819 align:start position:0%
um however excuse me are you saying that
 
02:34:05.389 --> 02:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
that running an illicit house of
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
prostitution is a misdemeanor that's a
 
02:34:09.050 --> 02:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor ma'am yes unless there's an
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
element of human trafficking involved
 
02:34:12.290 --> 02:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
which again
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
is are really our whole goal to try to
 
02:34:16.429 --> 02:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
establish and as already discussed it's
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
proven extremely difficult so for
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
facilitating a place under your control
 
02:34:23.210 --> 02:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of prostitution the
 
02:34:25.130 --> 02:34:25.140 align:start position:0%
penalty is only misdemeanor
 
02:34:28.610 --> 02:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
and um and again we've already discussed
 
02:34:33.230 --> 02:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
whether reluctant reluctant to come
 
02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
forward and work with police and I don't
 
02:34:36.770 --> 02:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
believe it should be the victim's
 
02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to stop the abuse they
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
are experiencing
 
02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:41.450 align:start position:0%
are experiencing
um

02:34:41.450 --> 02:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more than just the
 
02:34:45.770 --> 02:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system to augment these
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
investigations and hold those profiting
 
02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:49.010 align:start position:0%
investigations and hold those profiting
accountable

02:34:49.010 --> 02:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
02:34:51.170 --> 02:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
again I just really want to reinforce
 
02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
and Echo what was already said but I'm
 
02:34:54.889 --> 02:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
open to any questions to try to answer
 
02:34:58.610 --> 02:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
them thank you representative Dolan and
 
02:35:00.410 --> 02:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
then Gould
 
02:35:02.929 --> 02:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:35:05.450 --> 02:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
your testimony and the hard work that
 
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:12.050 --> 02:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to the lady from Derry
 
02:35:15.309 --> 02:35:15.319 align:start position:0%
uh her story I served
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh two decades
 
02:35:20.330 --> 02:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
as a town counselor in Londonderry and
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
being a sister Community ran across
 
02:35:27.050 --> 02:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
human trafficking uh several times and
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh I am getting to a question it is um
 
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
one of the most heartbreaking things you
 
02:35:37.490 --> 02:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
can see is when these teenagers
 
02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
in some cases pre-teens
 
02:35:43.130 --> 02:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
are brought forth from this environment
 
02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
and that that they're lost in they don't
 
02:35:48.170 --> 02:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
know what to do in
 
02:35:51.770 --> 02:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
um and my question to you is what is
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
your experience show is what happens uh
 
02:35:57.410 --> 02:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
to these folks that are
 
02:36:00.530 --> 02:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
are found out or are are accused of
 
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
human trafficking uh
 
02:36:05.510 --> 02:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
are they punished by their excuse me
 
02:36:07.190 --> 02:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan that's a
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
fascinating question but I'm not sure
 
02:36:11.389 --> 02:36:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's entirely relevant to the to the
 
02:36:13.070 --> 02:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
billing question
 
02:36:16.690 --> 02:36:16.700 align:start position:0%
do you think it is uh well I
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of I'm kind of working my way
 
02:36:23.450 --> 02:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
towards all of us so question then the
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
question is uh
 
02:36:28.270 --> 02:36:28.280 align:start position:0%
how how do you manage
 
02:36:33.050 --> 02:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
the victims that find themselves in this
 
02:36:36.410 --> 02:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
environment uh and you know especially
 
02:36:38.170 --> 02:36:38.180 align:start position:0%
the teens and preteens
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
well again sir I want to be honest I
 
02:36:42.710 --> 02:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
have no experience with uh dealing with
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
juveniles and these type of
 
02:36:45.889 --> 02:36:45.899 align:start position:0%
establishments so I can't speak
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:53.210 --> 02:36:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I lost my train of thought for
 
02:36:56.030 --> 02:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:58.490 --> 02:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
I mean the
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
severity for the crime of human
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
trafficking would be substantial if it
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
can be established and that is our goal
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
whether at the state level which would
 
02:37:07.370 --> 02:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
be a felony or at the federal level
 
02:37:09.469 --> 02:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
which you know the repercussions are
 
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
substantial but again getting their
 
02:37:15.410 --> 02:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
Improvement it's extremely difficult so
 
02:37:18.849 --> 02:37:18.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:21.469 --> 02:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:37:23.450 --> 02:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I and I think maybe other people may
 
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
have some questions which aren't
 
02:37:26.330 --> 02:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
directly on topic but if you could hang
 
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
around a little bit after the hearing
 
02:37:28.849 --> 02:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
maybe we could deal with them then
 
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
rather than drag this off thanks
 
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay represent Gerhard and then gold
 
02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:37:39.050 --> 02:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
so the victims thank you for coming
 
02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
today the victims we're not trying to
 
02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
charge or you don't want to be charging
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
the victims for these offenses but isn't
 
02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
that the whole premise of the drug war
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
catch a small fish lead you to the big
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
fish wasn't that the whole concept not
 
02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
that the drug war is a success but I'm
 
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
just saying wasn't that the isn't that
 
02:38:01.130 --> 02:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
I mean again I understand what you're
 
02:38:05.090 --> 02:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
saying but I'm a little confused by that
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
and how that really applies here I mean
 
02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:08.690 align:start position:0%
and how that really applies here I mean
I

02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:38:10.730 --> 02:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
you're right I'm testifying to state law
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer but are you asking
 
02:38:17.210 --> 02:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:19.969 --> 02:38:19.979 align:start position:0%
uh I yes representative Garner I think
 
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
it may be that in the case of a business
 
02:38:25.250 --> 02:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
like this the business owner is at least
 
02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
the medium-sized fish is already there
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
if that's correct
 
02:38:32.270 --> 02:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
so follow up
 
02:38:33.710 --> 02:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
well the just the concept of
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
establishing guilt or you know it just
 
02:38:39.050 --> 02:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
seems that so you have the lowest person
 
02:38:40.670 --> 02:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't technically catch
 
02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
easily you call these establishments we
 
02:38:44.330 --> 02:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
go in there not we I'm not going to but
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
you go in there and you disestablish the
 
02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:47.819 align:start position:0%
crime has been committed then you're
 
02:38:49.130 --> 02:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
saying that these people at the lowest
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
levels will not turn on the people at
 
02:38:52.849 --> 02:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
the next highest level oh and that's the
 
02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
thing and as I was saying I mean
 
02:38:56.090 --> 02:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
charging them could just put them in
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way for multiple reasons right
 
02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
and and yes I don't think even putting a
 
02:39:03.590 --> 02:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charge on them what why
 
02:39:05.330 --> 02:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
would that be enough for them to flip it
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's just a fine right it could be the
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
price of doing business it's not enough
 
02:39:11.809 --> 02:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
for them to you know put themselves in
 
02:39:14.570 --> 02:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
harm way and and rat out who's ever
 
02:39:17.389 --> 02:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
trafficking them I don't believe so
 
02:39:19.389 --> 02:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:39:21.530 --> 02:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
coming in and testifying I apologize
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I I wrote the two rsas down and I
 
02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
can read them later but then in your
 
02:39:30.830 --> 02:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
um is it so is it is what I'm hearing
 
02:39:36.170 --> 02:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
that you don't have a loss specifically
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
against trafficking no there is a law
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
633 7 but okay but but again really
 
02:39:44.570 --> 02:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
there to to dumb it down we need a
 
02:39:46.670 --> 02:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
commercial sex act with an element of
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
force fraud or coercion and in a massage
 
02:39:51.650 --> 02:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
parlor we would need that element of
 
02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
force voter coercion coming from the
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
victim okay and as and as discussed we
 
02:39:58.190 --> 02:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
can't Pierce that it's just you know
 
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
what whatever that element may be right
 
02:40:02.809 --> 02:40:02.819 align:start position:0%
one of those three things yes they're a
 
02:40:04.969 --> 02:40:04.979 align:start position:0%
little broad but I understand my social
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
work background is in Juvenile Justice
 
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
with adolescent females so I totally get
 
02:40:10.370 --> 02:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
all that
 
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so you have a law but this is going
 
02:40:16.010 --> 02:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
to help you in terms of Licensing so
 
02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
that as I'm understand it it gives you
 
02:40:20.929 --> 02:40:20.939 align:start position:0%
the cause for I'm sorry follow-up Madam
 
02:40:23.210 --> 02:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
chair yes thank you madam
 
02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
this gives you the cause to go into the
 
02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
establishment is that the deal if
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed I'm not using this
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
to go into an establishment my thought
 
02:40:35.809 --> 02:40:35.819 align:start position:0%
process is is that this would just help
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
regulate these businesses right it would
 
02:40:42.050 --> 02:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
give you know we would know who worked
 
02:40:43.849 --> 02:40:43.859 align:start position:0%
there it would prevent a consistent
 
02:40:46.490 --> 02:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
rotation of workers potentially
 
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
do you know what I mean I'm not asking
 
02:40:50.690 --> 02:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
to use this for law enforcement purposes
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
I just think it could be beneficial to
 
02:40:54.969 --> 02:40:54.979 align:start position:0%
victims of human trafficking thank you
 
02:40:58.190 --> 02:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up promise less
 
02:41:00.950 --> 02:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
in my experience in church in foster
 
02:41:03.469 --> 02:41:03.479 align:start position:0%
care or Residential Care where you're
 
02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
worried about perpetrators uh taking
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
children in and abusing them
 
02:41:10.490 --> 02:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
I find that uh
 
02:41:13.070 --> 02:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
my experience has been that a perp will
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
jump through any hoop but law-abiding
 
02:41:18.170 --> 02:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
citizens get to a point where they say
 
02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:19.429 align:start position:0%
citizens get to a point where they say
enough

02:41:19.429 --> 02:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:41:21.469 --> 02:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
and so you don't have I don't want to
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
lose my ability to get a massage I don't
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
want to see massage therapists harassed
 
02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
by regulations that are unnecessary
 
02:41:31.250 --> 02:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
unless I know how this is going to help
 
02:41:33.710 --> 02:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
and to me my concern is about well I can
 
02:41:36.050 --> 02:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
talk about that later that goes beyond
 
02:41:36.060 --> 02:41:36.650 align:start position:0%
talk about that later that goes beyond
um

02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:36.660 align:start position:0%

would positively impact our state and

our response to human trafficking thank

02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
Director of the New Hampshire human

services and Community Partners
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state I'm going to skip a
 
02:44:06.530 --> 02:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
little bit of the human trafficking
 
02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
background I was going to give because
 
02:44:09.410 --> 02:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
some of our colleagues have done that we
 
02:44:11.030 --> 02:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it yes I do want to
 
02:44:13.010 --> 02:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
just highlight the question from
 
02:44:15.170 --> 02:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative Gould earlier though that
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
the victims that we see around the state
 
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
are all ages genders demographics as are
 
02:44:22.270 --> 02:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
the perpetrators so it's not a specific
 
02:44:24.550 --> 02:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
immigration issue or anything like that
 
02:44:27.050 --> 02:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
the Polaris project which operates the
 
02:44:28.370 --> 02:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
national human trafficking hotline
 
02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
created the term illicit massage
 
02:44:32.030 --> 02:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
business to describe a very specific
 
02:44:34.309 --> 02:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
type of exploitative organized
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
commercial front trafficking venue that
 
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
they saw implicated over and over again
 
02:44:40.429 --> 02:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
in cases reported to their National
 
02:44:42.530 --> 02:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
hotline so that term doesn't Encompass
 
02:44:45.170 --> 02:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
legal therapeutic massage businesses nor
 
02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:47.399 align:start position:0%
does it include consensual sex work that
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
may incorporate massage
 
02:44:51.290 --> 02:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
while we know that it's not the sole
 
02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill the Coalition
 
02:44:54.469 --> 02:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
believes that this bill would help to
 
02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
address the growing problem of illicit
 
02:44:58.610 --> 02:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
massage businesses in New Hampshire so
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
oplc can speak more broadly to why this
 
02:45:04.610 --> 02:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
bill is essential but we are here on to
 
02:45:06.490 --> 02:45:06.500 align:start position:0%
talk about the human trafficking element
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
the task force has identified more than
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
50 such businesses in our state to date
 
02:45:14.510 --> 02:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult like officer
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
pendlebury said to initiate a human
 
02:45:17.809 --> 02:45:17.819 align:start position:0%
trafficking investigation in these
 
02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
situations because the trafficking
 
02:45:22.250 --> 02:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
prosecution relies so heavily on victim
 
02:45:24.170 --> 02:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
input and in the absence of a stable
 
02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
secure victim by which I mean a victim
 
02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
who is and feels safe from their
 
02:45:30.290 --> 02:45:30.300 align:start position:0%
trafficker it's nearly impossible to
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
gather that information about their
 
02:45:34.130 --> 02:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
trafficker to bring the case
 
02:45:36.170 --> 02:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's a priority of the Coalition in
 
02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
partnership with the task force to
 
02:45:39.290 --> 02:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
connect as many victims and survivors as
 
02:45:40.910 --> 02:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
possible with the services that can help
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
to raise them out of Crisis the
 
02:45:44.570 --> 02:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
Coalition and our crisis center is aim
 
02:45:46.270 --> 02:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
to provide access to robust
 
02:45:48.410 --> 02:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed victim-centered services
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
for all victims of human trafficking
 
02:45:53.809 --> 02:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
this necessitates Outreach to victims
 
02:45:55.309 --> 02:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
who may not realize that help is
 
02:45:56.690 --> 02:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
available and that the abuse and
 
02:45:58.190 --> 02:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
exploitation of their suffering actually
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
meet the definition of human trafficking
 
02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
we know that these businesses are
 
02:46:04.849 --> 02:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
operating around the state and that
 
02:46:06.410 --> 02:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
victims in these situations are
 
02:46:08.450 --> 02:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
carefully controlled and monitored by
 
02:46:10.429 --> 02:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
their traffickers with very little
 
02:46:12.889 --> 02:46:12.899 align:start position:0%
opportunity to seek help let alone to
 
02:46:14.389 --> 02:46:14.399 align:start position:0%
research what options might be available
 
02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
to them traffickers like previous
 
02:46:19.730 --> 02:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
testimonies have said traffickers exert
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
a massive amount of control over their
 
02:46:21.600 --> 02:46:22.730 align:start position:0%
a massive amount of control over their
victims

02:46:22.730 --> 02:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
victims
 
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
so they may be immigrants they may not
 
02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
be but traffickers can exploit social
 
02:46:29.330 --> 02:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
and cultural norms a relative lack of
 
02:46:31.610 --> 02:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
contacts and familiarity familiarity
 
02:46:33.469 --> 02:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
with local resources
 
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
02:46:37.910 --> 02:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
by telling that you know traffickers can
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
express to victims that they are
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
committing a crime of prostitution or
 
02:46:44.030 --> 02:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
related crimes and that if they report
 
02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:46.140 align:start position:0%
that or if they seek help they will be
 
02:46:47.870 --> 02:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
prosecuted themselves and that's you
 
02:46:48.830 --> 02:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
know like people have said already
 
02:46:50.929 --> 02:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
that's not what we want to do we want to
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's critical that we find every
 
02:47:00.050 --> 02:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to counter these dangerous
 
02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
messages and meet victims where they are
 
02:47:03.050 --> 02:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
so this legislation would create another
 
02:47:05.389 --> 02:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
way for victims to be identified and
 
02:47:07.849 --> 02:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
offered Services if we can have informed
 
02:47:09.530 --> 02:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
professionals making contact with these
 
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
victims at the point of licensure checks
 
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
we have an opportunity to connect with
 
02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
them to offer services and correct
 
02:47:17.750 --> 02:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
correct misconceptions about
 
02:47:20.570 --> 02:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
vulnerability to prosecution and removal
 
02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
so this we see this as an opportunity to
 
02:47:24.349 --> 02:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
offer someone a safe supported pathway
 
02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
out of their trafficking situation and
 
02:47:27.889 --> 02:47:27.899 align:start position:0%
connect them to the many services and
 
02:47:30.050 --> 02:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
resources that are available to them via
 
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
the coalitions 12 Regional Crisis
 
02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:32.750 align:start position:0%
the coalitions 12 Regional Crisis
centers

02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
centers
 
02:47:35.690 --> 02:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any any
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
specific questions
 
02:47:40.969 --> 02:47:40.979 align:start position:0%
okay I think we've worn ourselves out
 
02:47:59.750 --> 02:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:01.920 align:start position:0%

of this bill what this bill does
 
02:48:24.889 --> 02:48:24.899 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it's first of all
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's one piece of a very large puzzle
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
um this bill provides an ability to
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%

it reduces the disruption to legitimate
 
02:48:41.750 --> 02:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
businesses legitimate massage therapy

02:48:46.010 --> 02:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
um and in other businesses uh that are
 
02:48:48.050 --> 02:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
operating in the vicinity of these other
 
02:48:49.969 --> 02:48:49.979 align:start position:0%
establishments that are hosting
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice of Massage Therapy
 
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
this bill assists in the protection of
 
02:48:57.290 --> 02:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
the public health safety and Welfare
 
02:48:58.969 --> 02:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
this bill protects legitimate
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic massage business owners uh
 
02:49:04.490 --> 02:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
who are operating legally from those who
 
02:49:06.050 --> 02:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
are not
 
02:49:08.330 --> 02:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
this bill reinforces public confidence
 
02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
that an establishment and a licensee and
 
02:49:15.469 --> 02:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
or licensee within uh they're Meeting
 
02:49:17.090 --> 02:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
those minimum health and safety
 
02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:18.650 align:start position:0%
those minimum health and safety
requirements

02:49:18.650 --> 02:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:49:20.929 --> 02:49:20.939 align:start position:0%
those are some of the the key factors of
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
this bill right now we currently do not
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
have the ability to go in and
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
proactively investigate
 
02:49:31.130 --> 02:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
with other licensing boards we do other
 
02:49:33.290 --> 02:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
professions where we can go in we can
 
02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:34.550 align:start position:0%
professions where we can go in we can
inspect

02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
inspect
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
I want to assure something to this
 
02:49:38.030 --> 02:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
committee right now and I've heard the
 
02:49:39.889 --> 02:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
question asked we're not calling Mike
 
02:49:41.330 --> 02:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
and Charlie saying hey come out and do
 
02:49:42.830 --> 02:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
an inspection with us and if we find
 
02:49:45.530 --> 02:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
something you can move in that is not
 
02:49:47.330 --> 02:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
what's happening we already have
 
02:49:50.510 --> 02:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
statutes on the books that allow us when
 
02:49:52.490 --> 02:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
we are doing a regulatory investigation
 
02:49:55.370 --> 02:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
if we determine this criminal activity
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
we already have the authority to go and
 
02:49:59.750 --> 02:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
reach out to law enforcement and provide
 
02:50:02.690 --> 02:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
them with the evidence that we've seen
 
02:50:05.389 --> 02:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
as the current legislation that is
 
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
enacted today we license the LA we only
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
license the licensees not the
 
02:50:12.110 --> 02:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
establishment where they work
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
so when we get a complaint that comes in
 
02:50:16.250 --> 02:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
because we have to we're reactive not
 
02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:17.870 align:start position:0%
because we have to we're reactive not
proactive

02:50:17.870 --> 02:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
proactive
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
we will send inspectors out and I have
 
02:50:22.730 --> 02:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
personally this year made it a point to
 
02:50:25.849 --> 02:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
go out myself with other investigators I
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
can't get into all the details of the
 
02:50:28.969 --> 02:50:28.979 align:start position:0%
investigations but let me give you some
 
02:50:28.979 --> 02:50:30.290 align:start position:0%
investigations but let me give you some
highlights

02:50:30.290 --> 02:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
highlights
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
we approach a building it's in a strip
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
mall there's other businesses operating
 
02:50:37.670 --> 02:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
in order to gain entry you have to hit a
 
02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:39.530 align:start position:0%
in order to gain entry you have to hit a
buzzer

02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
buzzer
 
02:50:41.150 --> 02:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
they look through their camera they see
 
02:50:43.130 --> 02:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
who we are and they either refuse to
 
02:50:44.809 --> 02:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
open the door
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
um whether they do it verbally which has
 
02:50:49.730 --> 02:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
been done or they just don't open it
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
other times we've called in we've said
 
02:50:53.210 --> 02:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
hey are you open
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we're open come out the back I
 
02:50:56.330 --> 02:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
was like no we're gonna go in the front
 
02:50:58.730 --> 02:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
oh we're closed
 
02:50:58.740 --> 02:51:00.110 align:start position:0%
oh we're closed
okay

02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:51:02.270 --> 02:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
these are two incidents we also had we
 
02:51:04.010 --> 02:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
had a person and I don't want to get
 
02:51:06.650 --> 02:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
into too many details on this who
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
legitimately who believed he was
 
02:51:10.730 --> 02:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
visiting a legitimate massage parlor
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
until he got inside and things happened
 
02:51:18.410 --> 02:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
and money was demanded from him and he
 
02:51:20.510 --> 02:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
paid it because he didn't know it was on
 
02:51:23.750 --> 02:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
the other side of that door he paid it
 
02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:25.620 align:start position:0%
those are situations that we're running
 
02:51:29.150 --> 02:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
into now we can go in and we can attempt
 
02:51:32.450 --> 02:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
to identify who the unlicensed parties
 
02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:33.410 align:start position:0%
to identify who the unlicensed parties
are

02:51:33.410 --> 02:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:51:35.929 --> 02:51:35.939 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to allow us in and
 
02:51:38.270 --> 02:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
when we do go in we don't know if we're
 
02:51:40.490 --> 02:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
getting the right name I in in some
 
02:51:42.889 --> 02:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
instances in one particular case I was
 
02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
given four different names I don't know
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
who the person was I couldn't identify
 
02:51:48.230 --> 02:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:51:49.849 --> 02:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
when we left
 
02:51:52.610 --> 02:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
we had no Avenue by which to even
 
02:51:54.410 --> 02:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
attempt to close this business down
 
02:51:56.450 --> 02:51:56.460 align:start position:0%
because if they had an establishment
 
02:51:58.809 --> 02:51:58.819 align:start position:0%
license we could do a memo for the board
 
02:52:01.849 --> 02:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
highlight what happened and let the
 
02:52:04.309 --> 02:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
board determine if there are if this
 
02:52:04.319 --> 02:52:05.510 align:start position:0%
board determine if there are if this
business

02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:52:07.429 --> 02:52:07.439 align:start position:0%
posed an imminent danger to public
 
02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
health safety or welfare and if it did
 
02:52:11.450 --> 02:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
they would have the ability to
 
02:52:13.309 --> 02:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
immediately shut down the establishment
 
02:52:15.769 --> 02:52:15.779 align:start position:0%
we could then notify law enforcement and
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
if that establishment opens up again
 
02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
without being licensed they're in
 
02:52:19.680 --> 02:52:21.650 align:start position:0%
without being licensed they're in
violation

02:52:21.650 --> 02:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
violation
 
02:52:23.690 --> 02:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
we're coming at this from a pure
 
02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory perspective any ancillary
 
02:52:28.490 --> 02:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
issues that occur as a result of that
 
02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we're looking
 
02:52:29.880 --> 02:52:31.370 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we're looking
for

02:52:31.370 --> 02:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:52:31.380 --> 02:52:32.090 align:start position:0%
for
um

02:52:32.090 --> 02:52:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:34.010 --> 02:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
but I I do want to let this committee
 
02:52:35.510 --> 02:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
know as far as
 
02:52:37.910 --> 02:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
I've heard questions about ordinances as
 
02:52:40.370 --> 02:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
compared to licensure laws and and I
 
02:52:42.170 --> 02:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
agree ordinances are fine if they're
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
enforced and enacted the problem is the
 
02:52:45.769 --> 02:52:45.779 align:start position:0%
courts today especially the district
 
02:52:48.050 --> 02:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
courts don't take they really don't
 
02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
enforce the violation level ordinances
 
02:52:52.849 --> 02:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
police departments are overrun with
 
02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
other serious calls that they have to
 
02:52:57.050 --> 02:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
respond to and if they're responding to
 
02:52:59.510 --> 02:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance violations it ties up those
 
02:53:01.370 --> 02:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
units and those services
 
02:53:03.410 --> 02:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is if this is
 
02:53:04.969 --> 02:53:04.979 align:start position:0%
under a licensure an establishment
 
02:53:06.769 --> 02:53:06.779 align:start position:0%
licensure and you can look at our
 
02:53:08.210 --> 02:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
website and you can see some of the
 
02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
emergency suspensions that we have
 
02:53:12.290 --> 02:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
issued across the board for various
 
02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:13.490 align:start position:0%
issued across the board for various
professions

02:53:13.490 --> 02:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
professions
 
02:53:16.250 --> 02:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
if the board determines that there's an
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
imminent danger to the public health
 
02:53:20.210 --> 02:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
safety or welfare because we regulate
 
02:53:22.969 --> 02:53:22.979 align:start position:0%
that that business we can actually the
 
02:53:24.830 --> 02:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
board can actually issue an emergency
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
order now they do have due process that
 
02:53:29.690 --> 02:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
due process requires a hearing within 10
 
02:53:31.790 --> 02:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
days they can get that hearing
 
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
oftentimes what happens is we enter into
 
02:53:36.349 --> 02:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
a preliminary agreement not to practice
 
02:53:38.929 --> 02:53:38.939 align:start position:0%
pending the outcome of the investigation
 
02:53:40.550 --> 02:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
but these are some of the highlights
 
02:53:43.070 --> 02:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
that that we have that this bill brings
 
02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:44.330 align:start position:0%
that that we have that this bill brings
forward

02:53:44.330 --> 02:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:53:45.950 --> 02:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and you know an ordinance would not
 
02:53:48.110 --> 02:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
solve the immediacy and if we're dealing
 
02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
with people in consumers who are
 
02:53:52.610 --> 02:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
actually today being harmed
 
02:53:55.610 --> 02:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
we can't wait 6 8 10 12 weeks for an
 
02:53:58.130 --> 02:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
ordinance to violation to be tracked
 
02:54:00.170 --> 02:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
through the court system it should have
 
02:54:02.990 --> 02:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
a regulatory body which is us where the
 
02:54:04.550 --> 02:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
board would hear the facts and make a
 
02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
decision with that I'll be happy to
 
02:54:08.150 --> 02:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions if anybody has any
 
02:54:11.469 --> 02:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
I I have two actually uh
 
02:54:15.290 --> 02:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
so if I do I understand you correctly
 
02:54:16.990 --> 02:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
that you expect
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
a illicit business to not be able to get
 
02:54:23.690 --> 02:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
a license in the first place
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we would I you're
 
02:54:28.130 --> 02:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
asking me a hypothetical on something
 
02:54:29.510 --> 02:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
that we just don't know the answer to
 
02:54:30.889 --> 02:54:30.899 align:start position:0%
yet because
 
02:54:33.170 --> 02:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
when they apply for the license
 
02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
um it'll depend on what their
 
02:54:36.050 --> 02:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
application says and depending on what
 
02:54:38.450 --> 02:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
they're okay
 
02:54:43.250 --> 02:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
and but it you you do expect that if a
 
02:54:45.889 --> 02:54:45.899 align:start position:0%
complaint was received for from a
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
illicit establishment you
 
02:54:51.050 --> 02:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
you would be able to enter without their
 
02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:52.309 align:start position:0%
you would be able to enter without their
permission

02:54:52.309 --> 02:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
permission
 
02:54:55.929 --> 02:54:55.939 align:start position:0%
and shut them down immediately
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
or possibly the short board visit
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
inventory right so I want to make sure
 
02:55:01.610 --> 02:55:01.620 align:start position:0%
we're not going and kicking indoors so
 
02:55:03.410 --> 02:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
what happens we would go in for example
 
02:55:06.050 --> 02:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
and say we would like to come inspect
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
they could still refuse us but that
 
02:55:09.170 --> 02:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
would be a violation against their
 
02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
license we would then file that with the
 
02:55:12.889 --> 02:55:12.899 align:start position:0%
board and pull them in for a hearing I
 
02:55:15.410 --> 02:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that this statute
 
02:55:16.610 --> 02:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us the authority to just
 
02:55:18.889 --> 02:55:18.899 align:start position:0%
barge in I think it's still tell us no
 
02:55:22.849 --> 02:55:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:24.590 --> 02:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
um any other representative Simon thank
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
you madam chair just by way of
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
clarification this is obviously uh seems
 
02:55:31.550 --> 02:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
like a different sort of bill because
 
02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
two very obvious things are overlapping
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
with each other we're asking to
 
02:55:39.710 --> 02:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
um create a license for an establishment
 
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and we're also trying to combat a
 
02:55:43.969 --> 02:55:43.979 align:start position:0%
separate sort of crime at the same time
 
02:55:45.769 --> 02:55:45.779 align:start position:0%
um and I would kind of relate it to it
 
02:55:46.849 --> 02:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
would be like if we were going to
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
license food service industry people but
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're looking for money
 
02:55:50.399 --> 02:55:52.070 align:start position:0%
at the same time we're looking for money
laundering

02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
laundering
 
02:55:57.110 --> 02:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
um and so I guess my main question is
 
02:55:59.990 --> 02:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
we have two things that we're targeting
 
02:56:02.809 --> 02:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
but we have one inspector going in and
 
02:56:06.290 --> 02:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
as that inspector also supposed to be an
 
02:56:09.410 --> 02:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
expert in identifying trafficking
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
um in order to bring that information
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
out uh so that we can then look at that
 
02:56:17.389 --> 02:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
situation and and pursue the Avenues
 
02:56:18.830 --> 02:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about because we
 
02:56:20.210 --> 02:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
just have one inspector but we're really
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish two things at the
 
02:56:23.870 --> 02:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
same time and that's a great question uh
 
02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
so as far as being an expert no I think
 
02:56:28.610 --> 02:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of it would depend on what they
 
02:56:30.950 --> 02:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
see when they go in so if they if they
 
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
were to go in and see let's say
 
02:56:36.170 --> 02:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
something that appeared to be out of the
 
02:56:38.330 --> 02:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
ordinary that they would come back and
 
02:56:40.130 --> 02:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
report that to myself or the division
 
02:56:42.349 --> 02:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
director who's here and we would talk
 
02:56:43.730 --> 02:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
about it it's not like it would be an
 
02:56:45.410 --> 02:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
immediate call to law enforcement it may
 
02:56:46.969 --> 02:56:46.979 align:start position:0%
be something that's innocuous it may be
 
02:56:49.010 --> 02:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
something that's nothing they wouldn't
 
02:56:53.090 --> 02:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
be an expert per se but I think that uh
 
02:56:55.010 --> 02:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
this really comes down to accountability
 
02:56:57.530 --> 02:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
right now there's no accountability and
 
02:56:59.570 --> 02:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
if we have the establishment licensure
 
02:57:02.090 --> 02:57:02.100 align:start position:0%
we can absolutely hold that that
 
02:57:04.730 --> 02:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
business owner or establishment owner
 
02:57:04.740 --> 02:57:06.309 align:start position:0%
business owner or establishment owner
accountable

02:57:06.309 --> 02:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
02:57:09.769 --> 02:57:09.779 align:start position:0%
through the investigation process we may
 
02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
learn that there's criminal activity and
 
02:57:13.550 --> 02:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
we will definitely report that out to
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and other other Health
 
02:57:19.130 --> 02:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
licensing agencies as well so I hope
 
02:57:20.330 --> 02:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
that answers but no we're not going to
 
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
um right so I mean one of the things
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to balance as
 
02:57:30.290 --> 02:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this obviously we want
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
accountability right but we're balancing
 
02:57:34.910 --> 02:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
accountability with harassment and and
 
02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
no matter what we do the risk of both is
 
02:57:39.290 --> 02:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
present right I mean we could overstep
 
02:57:41.269 --> 02:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
our bounds and harass somebody innocent
 
02:57:44.510 --> 02:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
or vice versa and so once again we're
 
02:57:47.269 --> 02:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
looking at a particular person as being
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
the kind of the spearhead of that
 
02:57:51.950 --> 02:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
operation and that person is an
 
02:57:55.510 --> 02:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
inspector it's for massage
 
02:57:58.490 --> 02:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
establishments it's not an inspector for
 
02:58:01.090 --> 02:58:01.100 align:start position:0%
looking for illicit
 
02:58:04.130 --> 02:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
businesses correct correct so how from
 
02:58:06.050 --> 02:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
your perspective how do you really
 
02:58:07.910 --> 02:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
thread that needle
 
02:58:07.920 --> 02:58:10.250 align:start position:0%
thread that needle
well

02:58:10.250 --> 02:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:58:11.990 --> 02:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
it is a difference and I'm sympathetic
 
02:58:13.370 --> 02:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
to obviously I you know I want
 
02:58:14.809 --> 02:58:14.819 align:start position:0%
trafficking to stop so I'm not saying
 
02:58:16.610 --> 02:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
you know no I understand and I think
 
02:58:18.710 --> 02:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand uh from our
 
02:58:20.809 --> 02:58:20.819 align:start position:0%
perspective when we look at this so we
 
02:58:22.670 --> 02:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
have that inspector who goes in to do a
 
02:58:24.050 --> 02:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
random inspection we don't have to wait
 
02:58:26.030 --> 02:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
for a complaint so we don't have to wait
 
02:58:28.250 --> 02:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
for the Post action we we can try to be
 
02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh proactive
 
02:58:32.210 --> 02:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
they're going and looking for health and
 
02:58:35.030 --> 02:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
safety code violations to make sure that
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
they're properly set up that you know if
 
02:58:38.990 --> 02:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
they're and I don't know what those are
 
02:58:40.849 --> 02:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
those haven't been fully flushed out and
 
02:58:45.349 --> 02:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert on that so uh the the
 
02:58:47.630 --> 02:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
key here is to determine whether they
 
02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
meet those minimum safety requirements
 
02:58:51.950 --> 02:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
if other things are happening and they
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
observe it then they will bring that
 
02:58:55.849 --> 02:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
back to us and we'll we'll discuss it
 
02:58:57.410 --> 02:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
but no their primary function is
 
02:59:00.590 --> 02:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory not criminal investigation
 
02:59:03.889 --> 02:59:03.899 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you other questions
 
02:59:07.130 --> 02:59:07.140 align:start position:0%
yes represent a bear
 
02:59:09.410 --> 02:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:59:12.170 --> 02:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
I just have one last question and that
 
02:59:12.180 --> 02:59:13.730 align:start position:0%
I just have one last question and that
is

02:59:13.730 --> 02:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:59:16.389 --> 02:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
is there anything in your enforcement
 
02:59:21.170 --> 02:59:21.180 align:start position:0%
regulations currently or audits that you
 
02:59:23.690 --> 02:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
could increase without this lobbying
 
02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:26.030 align:start position:0%
could increase without this lobbying
enacted

02:59:26.030 --> 02:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
with specifically with massage
 
02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh itself yes right now we don't have
 
02:59:34.849 --> 02:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
the ability to do any inspections until
 
02:59:37.490 --> 02:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
we receive a complaint so
 
02:59:40.010 --> 02:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
even if we do the investigation and or
 
02:59:41.450 --> 02:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
inspection and like I said I've been
 
02:59:43.070 --> 02:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
part of those this year I've made it an
 
02:59:44.570 --> 02:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
effort to do so
 
02:59:46.610 --> 02:59:46.620 align:start position:0%
if if we're refused entry there's just
 
02:59:49.550 --> 02:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
nothing we can do and we receive these
 
02:59:52.010 --> 02:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
calls from towns across the state uh
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Dairy and then up in the
 
02:59:56.750 --> 02:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
north country and they're frustrated and
 
02:59:58.969 --> 02:59:58.979 align:start position:0%
so unless we have that ability to
 
03:00:01.309 --> 03:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
actually inspect
 
03:00:03.469 --> 03:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
there's very little little to nothing
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
that we can do yeah okay
 
03:00:12.830 --> 03:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I was actually incredibly
 
03:00:17.630 --> 03:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
disheartened to hear you say that the
 
03:00:20.389 --> 03:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
circuit courts and the police don't
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
enforce our ordinances because it seems
 
03:00:26.030 --> 03:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
to me that we're band-aiding a new law
 
03:00:29.210 --> 03:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
on top of an existing law that is not
 
03:00:32.450 --> 03:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
enforced and I have some very deep
 
03:00:36.050 --> 03:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
philosophical objections to that and I
 
03:00:37.910 --> 03:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
think it's it's not
 
03:00:40.010 --> 03:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
you know and I want to be very very
 
03:00:42.469 --> 03:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
clear here it's also the speed by which
 
03:00:45.230 --> 03:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
action can occur right if you if you do
 
03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
an ordinance violation that goes through
 
03:00:49.070 --> 03:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
the court system even if it is enforced
 
03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
through the courts it's going to take a
 
03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
long time
 
03:00:55.070 --> 03:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
by issuing an establishment license if
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
we run into a situation that requires
 
03:01:00.050 --> 03:01:00.060 align:start position:0%
the immediacy
 
03:01:01.849 --> 03:01:01.859 align:start position:0%
imminent danger to the public health
 
03:01:04.490 --> 03:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
safety and Welfare we have the ability
 
03:01:07.670 --> 03:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
to take action immediately and then
 
03:01:09.170 --> 03:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
within 10 days they can have their
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
hearing so even if an ordinance
 
03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
violation is brought before the courts
 
03:01:15.650 --> 03:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
by the time that works itself through
 
03:01:18.250 --> 03:01:18.260 align:start position:0%
the system we've already taken action
 
03:01:21.410 --> 03:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
regulatory wise thank you thank you any
 
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
other questions representative true
 
03:01:26.269 --> 03:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
03:01:31.969 --> 03:01:31.979 align:start position:0%
so let this build massage therapist
 
03:01:34.190 --> 03:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
already are licensed and what this bill
 
03:01:36.889 --> 03:01:36.899 align:start position:0%
would do would establish
 
03:01:38.450 --> 03:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
a business
 
03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh over a facility that has massage
 
03:01:46.130 --> 03:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
therapists working at correct
 
03:01:49.130 --> 03:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair
 
03:01:49.140 --> 03:01:52.370 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you madam chair
so

03:01:52.370 --> 03:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:54.889 --> 03:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
how would you go about determining that
 
03:01:54.899 --> 03:01:55.849 align:start position:0%
how would you go about determining that
uh

03:01:55.849 --> 03:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
a business that has massage tables in it
 
03:01:58.800 --> 03:01:59.929 align:start position:0%
a business that has massage tables in it
empty

03:01:59.929 --> 03:01:59.939 align:start position:0%
empty
 
03:02:03.530 --> 03:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
is harmful to the Public Health and
 
03:02:03.540 --> 03:02:05.330 align:start position:0%
is harmful to the Public Health and
Welfare

03:02:05.330 --> 03:02:05.340 align:start position:0%
Welfare
 
03:02:07.010 --> 03:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so the first
 
03:02:08.690 --> 03:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
thing we would do is check to make sure
 
03:02:11.150 --> 03:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
that those who are slated to be working
 
03:02:13.610 --> 03:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
there are actually licensed that's the
 
03:02:16.070 --> 03:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
very first step that we would look at so
 
03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
the establishment licensure would allow
 
03:02:20.210 --> 03:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
our our inspector to go in
 
03:02:24.170 --> 03:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
and determine who is licensed and if we
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
determine that there are three licensees
 
03:02:28.910 --> 03:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
in our database that that are working
 
03:02:32.750 --> 03:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
there and they have uh six
 
03:02:35.389 --> 03:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
right we have a problem we have to
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
figure out who's licensed who's not
 
03:02:41.090 --> 03:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
anytime an unlicensed party conducts any
 
03:02:43.610 --> 03:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
type of profession it erodes at the
 
03:02:45.590 --> 03:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
safety of that profession those
 
03:02:47.570 --> 03:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
professionals who who obtained
 
03:02:50.630 --> 03:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
professional licensure have met the
 
03:02:52.490 --> 03:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements of health and
 
03:02:54.410 --> 03:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
safety so first thing we look for is
 
03:02:57.290 --> 03:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
licensed versus unlicensed
 
03:02:59.690 --> 03:02:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you other question yes
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm confused are there currently a
 
03:03:07.370 --> 03:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
requirement that massage therapists are
 
03:03:09.710 --> 03:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
licensed oh yeah sure absolutely okay
 
03:03:12.590 --> 03:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:13.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:03:13.389 --> 03:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:16.010 --> 03:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
yes indeed you know all the massage
 
03:03:18.889 --> 03:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
there therapists are licensed yes or
 
03:03:20.090 --> 03:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
should be
 
03:03:22.370 --> 03:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:03:24.410 --> 03:03:24.420 align:start position:0%

house bill 105.
 
03:04:47.269 --> 03:04:47.279 align:start position:0%

the committee on this bill I'm hoping
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
um we we changed this bill last year for
 
03:04:58.070 --> 03:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
future work
 
03:05:00.050 --> 03:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
and we've since learned that finally
 
03:05:03.889 --> 03:05:03.899 align:start position:0%
when we filed this bill
 
03:05:07.370 --> 03:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
we did receive several
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh comments from professional advocacy
 
03:05:13.070 --> 03:05:13.080 align:start position:0%

03:05:13.080 --> 03:05:14.690 align:start position:0%

legislation
 
03:05:16.969 --> 03:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
based on this in the testimony that
 
03:05:19.010 --> 03:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
you'll hear today I ask you that you
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%

all the concerns through either an
 
03:05:27.410 --> 03:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
amended bill or rulemaking so I asked
 
03:05:29.330 --> 03:05:29.340 align:start position:0%
I'm asking the committee to retain the
 
03:05:32.330 --> 03:05:32.340 align:start position:0%

to touch on
 
03:09:13.849 --> 03:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
my conditional support of the bill Katy
 
03:09:15.230 --> 03:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
Medical Group believes that the Bill's
 
03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
intentions are indeed to create a safe
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
environment for all patients seeking
 
03:09:22.370 --> 03:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
aesthetic care however there is a large
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
group of providers that are left out of
 
03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
this bill physician assistants or PAs
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
do provide care throughout the city of
 
03:09:32.349 --> 03:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in many different settings
 
03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
and Specialties they offer a wide array
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
of Knowledge and Skills in training in
 
03:09:40.429 --> 03:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
the medical Fields they've helped
 
03:09:41.870 --> 03:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
alleviate a shortage of medical
 
03:09:42.889 --> 03:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
providers throughout the years
 
03:09:44.450 --> 03:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
especially throughout the pandemic that
 
03:09:47.210 --> 03:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
we had experience at Dartmouth many
 
03:09:49.490 --> 03:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
other hospitals we're very fortunate to
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
have Pas in that regard
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
and currently the regular the
 
03:09:57.530 --> 03:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
regulations already do exist and dictate
 
03:10:00.230 --> 03:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
the parameters of how Pas are permitted
 
03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
to practice directly through the Board
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
of Medicine
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh we can definitely practice and kitty
 
03:10:08.510 --> 03:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
Medical Group does not find it necessary
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
to add additional restrictions to the
 
03:10:11.809 --> 03:10:11.819 align:start position:0%
natures of how Pas can practice since
 
03:10:13.370 --> 03:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
this has already been ruled in the past
 
03:10:16.070 --> 03:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
in various other fields and Specialties
 
03:10:17.330 --> 03:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
within medicine in the state of New
 
03:10:17.340 --> 03:10:19.010 align:start position:0%
within medicine in the state of New
Hampshire

03:10:19.010 --> 03:10:19.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:10:21.230 --> 03:10:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and specifically on the cover page
 
03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see a highlighted portion that
 
03:10:26.570 --> 03:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
portion there is the portion of the bill
 
03:10:31.969 --> 03:10:31.979 align:start position:0%
um that is uh I request an amendment on
 
03:10:34.429 --> 03:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
um it's our belief that Pas need to be
 
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
excluded from these restrictions and
 
03:10:38.450 --> 03:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
that the policy conforms to the current
 
03:10:39.950 --> 03:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
medical standard of other Medical
 
03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
Specialties until the wording has been
 
03:10:46.490 --> 03:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
amended in the bill to exclude ppas from
 
03:10:49.130 --> 03:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
these increased restrictions uh kidney
 
03:10:50.570 --> 03:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
Medical Group cannot fully support this
 
03:10:52.610 --> 03:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
bill we agree with all the other details
 
03:10:55.730 --> 03:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
that are within the bill and we ask that
 
03:10:58.090 --> 03:10:58.100 align:start position:0%
this change to be considered
 
03:11:00.349 --> 03:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
therefore we do offer our conditional
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
approval specifically in the highlighted
 
03:11:03.359 --> 03:11:04.849 align:start position:0%
approval specifically in the highlighted
portion

03:11:04.849 --> 03:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
portion
 
03:11:04.859 --> 03:11:05.510 align:start position:0%
portion
um

03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
we asked that house bill 105 can include
 
03:11:10.190 --> 03:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
physician assistance as medical
 
03:11:12.170 --> 03:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
providers are able to perform the
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
initial assessment and create the
 
03:11:16.510 --> 03:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
treatment plan without direct oversight
 
03:11:19.910 --> 03:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
as previously stated this has already
 
03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
been covered throughout the scope of Pas
 
03:11:24.889 --> 03:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
with their supervising positions
 
03:11:27.290 --> 03:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
and in that layout
 
03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:27.969 align:start position:0%
and in that layout
um

03:11:27.969 --> 03:11:27.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
now to move on so Health spill 105 is a
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
step in the right direction
 
03:11:35.929 --> 03:11:35.939 align:start position:0%
for Consumer Protection in the field of
 
03:11:38.090 --> 03:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
Medical Aesthetics consumer protection
 
03:11:40.670 --> 03:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
safeguards are desperately needed
 
03:11:42.889 --> 03:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
in the field of Medical Aesthetics to do
 
03:11:44.690 --> 03:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
the added risks inherent with the
 
03:11:46.309 --> 03:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
procedures undertaken in this field
 
03:11:48.590 --> 03:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of oversight a lack of
 
03:11:50.929 --> 03:11:50.939 align:start position:0%
transparency in this industry
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
Medical Aesthetics Remains the last wild
 
03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
west of the medical community with
 
03:11:56.690 --> 03:11:56.700 align:start position:0%
little oversight and or training
 
03:12:02.510 --> 03:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
inherent to the industry is the
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
prevalent of off-label use
 
03:12:08.990 --> 03:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
of many medications therapies and
 
03:12:11.210 --> 03:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
procedures it is the right of the
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
medical provider to provide the care
 
03:12:14.450 --> 03:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
that they best see fit with careful
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
consultation with the patients with the
 
03:12:19.250 --> 03:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
associated risks of off label care
 
03:12:21.769 --> 03:12:21.779 align:start position:0%
however the field of Medical Aesthetics
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
providers May downplay the risk
 
03:12:25.550 --> 03:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
associated with many off-label care for
 
03:12:27.950 --> 03:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
the pursuit for the pursuant of profit
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
for example vascular occlusion of
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
hyaluronic acid filler often caused by
 
03:12:34.370 --> 03:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
an accidental injection of a product
 
03:12:37.070 --> 03:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
into an artery is rare certainly but
 
03:12:38.809 --> 03:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
could potentially lead to a serious
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
complication such as blindness if the
 
03:12:43.490 --> 03:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
injection is around the orbital region
 
03:12:45.410 --> 03:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
many aesthetic clinicians are simply not
 
03:12:47.030 --> 03:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
prepared for such an emergency of this
 
03:12:49.490 --> 03:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
incident were to occur
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
and do this lack of medical oversight or
 
03:12:53.990 --> 03:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
because the procedure is performed in a
 
03:12:55.610 --> 03:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
non-medical setting
 
03:12:58.670 --> 03:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
lacking the proper emergency supplies an
 
03:13:01.730 --> 03:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
injector in the back of the salon May
 
03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
lack the emergency supplies to remedy
 
03:13:06.050 --> 03:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
and occlusion an important reminder to
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
the public is that while the procedures
 
03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
are aesthetic they are still Medical in
 
03:13:12.769 --> 03:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
nature and should only be performed in
 
03:13:14.929 --> 03:13:14.939 align:start position:0%
clinical environments equipped to handle
 
03:13:16.610 --> 03:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
emergency situations
 
03:13:19.070 --> 03:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
further oversight is necessary for
 
03:13:20.570 --> 03:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection
 
03:13:23.330 --> 03:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
many medical spas providers advertise
 
03:13:25.370 --> 03:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
dubious claims about pharmaceutical
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
procedures and procured from
 
03:13:30.590 --> 03:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
underregulated compounding pharmacies
 
03:13:32.330 --> 03:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
compounding pharmacies do certainly
 
03:13:34.610 --> 03:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
indeed play a great role in this field
 
03:13:36.650 --> 03:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the medical industry
 
03:13:38.570 --> 03:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
to provide effective medications to
 
03:13:41.690 --> 03:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
patients however in recent years many
 
03:13:43.610 --> 03:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
compounding pharmacies with unfavorable
 
03:13:46.610 --> 03:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
track records with the FDA have sprung
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
up to cater to the ongoing demand of
 
03:13:51.710 --> 03:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
this of this ever-growing industry that
 
03:13:54.170 --> 03:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
being Medical Aesthetics for cheap
 
03:13:56.510 --> 03:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
medications so there have been numerous
 
03:13:58.550 --> 03:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
incidents in multiple states of expired
 
03:13:59.929 --> 03:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
medications being administered on
 
03:14:02.929 --> 03:14:02.939 align:start position:0%
patients in medical spa settings
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of the medical space so
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
furthermore the majority of medical spas
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
are inactive of non-compliance with
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations relating to the no
 
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
surprise Act
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
many Medical Spa clinics do not display
 
03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
their pricing before patients receive a
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
treatment in most cases the cost of
 
03:14:23.450 --> 03:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
treatment is not known until after the
 
03:14:25.070 --> 03:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
treatment has been performed under
 
03:14:27.530 --> 03:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
federal law medical providers are
 
03:14:30.110 --> 03:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
required to provide at least a good
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
faith estimate of the cost of treatment
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
more moreover in many states medical
 
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
spas fails to inform patients of the
 
03:14:39.530 --> 03:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
cost of the treatments
 
03:14:41.330 --> 03:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
in many cases the cost of treatments can
 
03:14:43.490 --> 03:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
be thousands of dollars which is quite a
 
03:14:46.070 --> 03:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
bit for a person to endure it
 
03:14:48.230 --> 03:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
additionally instances using laser
 
03:14:50.450 --> 03:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
Technologies by untrained non-medical
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
professionals are going unchecked the
 
03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
dangers of lasers are immense and can
 
03:14:57.650 --> 03:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
cause irreparable irreversible damage to
 
03:15:00.349 --> 03:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
a patient including blindness permanent
 
03:15:00.359 --> 03:15:01.670 align:start position:0%
a patient including blindness permanent
damage

03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
damage
 
03:15:03.769 --> 03:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
most of these issues prevalent in the
 
03:15:05.389 --> 03:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
medical spa industry can be resolved if
 
03:15:06.769 --> 03:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
there was closer relationship between
 
03:15:09.050 --> 03:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
medical spas in the existing medical
 
03:15:10.849 --> 03:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
establishment the existing medical
 
03:15:12.410 --> 03:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
establishment says policies and
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
procedures in place to protect these
 
03:15:16.670 --> 03:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
patients the existing medical
 
03:15:18.230 --> 03:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
establishment also insists on having
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
medical providers on premises for the
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
safety of the patients the relative
 
03:15:24.170 --> 03:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
costs that would be borne by the
 
03:15:25.730 --> 03:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
industry would only slightly diminish
 
03:15:27.410 --> 03:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
the high margins
 
03:15:29.690 --> 03:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
prevalent in the industry and would be
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
offset by the greater consumer trusts in
 
03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
the industry in conclusion
 
03:15:36.050 --> 03:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
Katy Medical Group supports House Bill
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
105 as a step in the right direction for
 
03:15:40.969 --> 03:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
Consumer safety
 
03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:15:43.020 --> 03:15:45.050 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
questions

03:15:45.050 --> 03:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I'm I'm sure the
 
03:15:50.150 --> 03:15:50.160 align:start position:0%

03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:09.650 --> 03:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
03:16:10.849 --> 03:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:16:12.290 --> 03:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
David cuzzy with Prospect Hill
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
strategies here in Concord uh here this
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
morning this afternoon now on behalf of
 
03:16:19.849 --> 03:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Society of physician
 
03:16:22.990 --> 03:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
assistants or nispa or simply the Pas
 
03:16:26.269 --> 03:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker I think
 
03:16:28.370 --> 03:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
said most of what I was going to say
 
03:16:30.290 --> 03:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
probably better than I so I appreciate
 
03:16:30.300 --> 03:16:31.309 align:start position:0%
probably better than I so I appreciate
that

03:16:31.309 --> 03:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:33.769 --> 03:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
um but I am here on behalf of the 1000
 
03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
or so Pas here in New Hampshire I've had
 
03:16:38.750 --> 03:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh good conversations with
 
03:16:40.490 --> 03:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Rhoda we're looking
 
03:16:42.650 --> 03:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
forward to being active participants in
 
03:16:45.050 --> 03:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
the uh subcommittee and any further
 
03:16:47.690 --> 03:16:47.700 align:start position:0%
discussions uh as previously noted of
 
03:16:50.210 --> 03:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
course we were unintentionally excluded
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill members of the committee
 
03:16:55.910 --> 03:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
who were here last term remember that
 
03:16:59.750 --> 03:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
the Pas had Senate Bill 228 which
 
03:17:02.570 --> 03:17:02.580 align:start position:0%
introduced which modernized the PA
 
03:17:04.969 --> 03:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
practice brought the statutes and regs
 
03:17:08.349 --> 03:17:08.359 align:start position:0%
in line with more tradition more modern
 
03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
Uh current uh practicing of medicine and
 
03:17:14.929 --> 03:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
that included changes to the terminology
 
03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the terminology of like a responsible
 
03:17:19.490 --> 03:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
physician is now a collaborating
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
physician things along those lines this
 
03:17:24.410 --> 03:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
uh unintendedly would have rolled a lot
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
of that progress back we we appreciate I
 
03:17:30.530 --> 03:17:30.540 align:start position:0%
did send in on behalf of the Pas a
 
03:17:32.750 --> 03:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
suggested Amendment where physician
 
03:17:36.290 --> 03:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
assistance could be added as appropriate
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
of course we'll work on that I think I
 
03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me briefly and
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if any
 
03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt
 
03:17:47.389 --> 03:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair welcome back to
 
03:17:48.889 --> 03:17:48.899 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
03:17:50.809 --> 03:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
um so sir
 
03:17:50.819 --> 03:17:52.730 align:start position:0%
um so sir
um

03:17:52.730 --> 03:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:54.070 --> 03:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
are you going to be available for the
 
03:17:56.279 --> 03:17:57.050 align:start position:0%
are you going to be available for the
sub

03:17:57.050 --> 03:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
sub
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely if if not me we'll have
 
03:18:02.690 --> 03:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh one of the Pas available it's it's
 
03:18:04.429 --> 03:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
difficult with all the the busyness
 
03:18:06.110 --> 03:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
within the Healthcare Community to get
 
03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
someone here but will absolutely be be
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
participating yes representative okay
 
03:18:13.849 --> 03:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
follow up so uh I I I've had several
 
03:18:16.730 --> 03:18:16.740 align:start position:0%
serious uh medical procedures and very
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
often they have involved at some point
 
03:18:20.389 --> 03:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
in the procedure
 
03:18:23.870 --> 03:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh pas okay so I know that they have a
 
03:18:25.809 --> 03:18:25.819 align:start position:0%
very high level of Medical Training
 
03:18:29.809 --> 03:18:29.819 align:start position:0%
compared and aprns also uh can have
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
Advanced Training uh and can do many
 
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
things that doctors used to do
 
03:18:39.110 --> 03:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
exclusively okay so uh it seems to me
 
03:18:42.230 --> 03:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
that it's it's inherent that when you're
 
03:18:45.469 --> 03:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
doing things involving injections uh
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
that you have to have people with a high
 
03:18:52.429 --> 03:18:52.439 align:start position:0%
level of background training this is
 
03:18:56.469 --> 03:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
where my question is going to because
 
03:18:59.929 --> 03:18:59.939 align:start position:0%
untoward circumstances can occur and you
 
03:19:02.450 --> 03:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
you need to have the high level training
 
03:19:04.269 --> 03:19:04.279 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to deal with
 
03:19:08.030 --> 03:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
untoward events is that not correct that
 
03:19:10.969 --> 03:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
you can't get with somebody who has no
 
03:19:13.250 --> 03:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
substantial medical training thank you
 
03:19:14.990 --> 03:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
for the question representative yes that
 
03:19:18.230 --> 03:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct and PAs uh of course they
 
03:19:20.510 --> 03:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
would they are only allowed to practice
 
03:19:23.870 --> 03:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh according to their education training
 
03:19:26.050 --> 03:19:26.060 align:start position:0%
and and any other uh pertinent
 
03:19:28.969 --> 03:19:28.979 align:start position:0%
sub-specialty training yes
 
03:19:30.830 --> 03:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other other
 
03:19:30.840 --> 03:19:31.969 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other other
questions

03:19:31.969 --> 03:19:31.979 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:19:34.730 --> 03:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%

03:20:11.389 --> 03:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
well if you want do you want to speak to
 
03:20:13.370 --> 03:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
him I think representative schuette
 
03:20:15.469 --> 03:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to retain the bill so she'll make
 
03:20:17.630 --> 03:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
the motion if I will draw mine thank you
 
03:20:19.370 --> 03:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
sure it makes the motion all right then
 
03:20:22.250 --> 03:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:29.389 --> 03:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:31.250 --> 03:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
just hearing that
 
03:20:34.330 --> 03:20:34.340 align:start position:0%
um both are
 
03:20:37.610 --> 03:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
Democratic leader and the chair feel
 
03:20:39.469 --> 03:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
that the proper thing to do with this
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
Phil is retain it and since we've heard
 
03:20:45.769 --> 03:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
that it does need a little work I think
 
03:20:48.050 --> 03:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriate motion
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to speak to my second
 
03:20:50.399 --> 03:20:52.250 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to speak to my second
because

03:20:52.250 --> 03:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:20:55.309 --> 03:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns I am not at all
 
03:20:57.889 --> 03:20:57.899 align:start position:0%
convinced that the approach this bill
 
03:21:01.070 --> 03:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
takes is the correct one but it doesn't
 
03:21:03.290 --> 03:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
it's possible and it does need some work
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
before we seriously consider it
 
03:21:10.370 --> 03:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:13.790 --> 03:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none those in favor of
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair and members of the
 
04:31:07.010 --> 04:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mary Sullivan Heath
 
04:31:11.330 --> 04:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
and I represent District 41 Wards 2 4 5
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
and 7 in the city of Manchester and I
 
04:31:16.670 --> 04:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
also want to preface my remarks um by
 
04:31:18.830 --> 04:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
letting you know we have a member of our
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester School Board here today Sean
 
04:31:23.389 --> 04:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
Parr and they have
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
um made as a priority preschool
 
04:31:28.010 --> 04:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
education in the city of Manchester and
 
04:31:30.110 --> 04:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why I
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
submitted this bill as well as
 
04:31:36.530 --> 04:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
numerous meetings around the
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
conversation beginning a pilot program
 
04:31:42.170 --> 04:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
for three and four-year-olds
 
04:31:44.050 --> 04:31:44.060 align:start position:0%
so let me begin
 
04:31:47.929 --> 04:31:47.939 align:start position:0%
as an educational administrator I worked
 
04:31:50.570 --> 04:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
at the department I was a teacher I a
 
04:31:52.269 --> 04:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
special education teacher assistant
 
04:31:54.889 --> 04:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
superintendent and over the years I've
 
04:31:57.649 --> 04:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
worked with hundreds of children going
 
04:32:00.649 --> 04:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
into kindergarten and we usually would
 
04:32:03.950 --> 04:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
do an early childhood assessment as they
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
came into kindergarten so we could
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
prepare their program and we saw very
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
clearly that those children who had had
 
04:32:14.809 --> 04:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
some kind of a high quality preschool
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
experience always performed at a much
 
04:32:19.729 --> 04:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
higher level
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
this 50 years of research that supports
 
04:32:22.319 --> 04:32:23.689 align:start position:0%
this 50 years of research that supports
that

04:32:23.689 --> 04:32:23.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
so it's the goal of House Bill 620 to
 
04:32:28.370 --> 04:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
work toward offering three and
 
04:32:31.570 --> 04:32:31.580 align:start position:0%
four-year-old children a high quality
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten learning opportunity
 
04:32:36.710 --> 04:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
within an executive branch Department of
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
early childhood
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
we believe every child should have an
 
04:32:43.010 --> 04:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity to achieve at high levels
 
04:32:45.530 --> 04:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
this is not only a moral imperative but
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's essential to our economic success
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
and societal well-being I also am
 
04:32:52.670 --> 04:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
working on an international study
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
committee with ncsl we spent the last
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
two years reviewing countries around the
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
world that achieve at really high levels
 
04:33:03.710 --> 04:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
on the Pisa
 
04:33:07.250 --> 04:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
and we found a pattern within all of
 
04:33:09.709 --> 04:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
these one of the first things that
 
04:33:12.650 --> 04:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
they've done is they've promoted Early
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
Childhood programs for children and that
 
04:33:16.320 --> 04:33:17.209 align:start position:0%
Childhood programs for children and that
has

04:33:17.209 --> 04:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:33:19.551 --> 04:33:19.561 align:start position:0%
that's aligned with their study of
 
04:33:21.949 --> 04:33:21.959 align:start position:0%
curriculum and it has and of course
 
04:33:23.810 --> 04:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
professional development for the
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
teachers that goes along with that but
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
they've found a strong
 
04:33:29.869 --> 04:33:29.879 align:start position:0%
correlation between early childhood
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
education and long-term student
 
04:33:32.039 --> 04:33:34.970 align:start position:0%
education and long-term student
achievement

04:33:34.970 --> 04:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:37.449 --> 04:33:37.459 align:start position:0%
God bless you
 
04:33:40.670 --> 04:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
hb620 establishes an executive branch
 
04:33:42.670 --> 04:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
Department of early childhood education
 
04:33:45.769 --> 04:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
and also establishes the Authority for
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
the Department to design create and
 
04:33:51.131 --> 04:33:51.141 align:start position:0%
administer a three-year high-quality
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
community-based mixed delivery public
 
04:33:58.150 --> 04:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:02.510 --> 04:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
I emailed all of my testimony to you so
 
04:34:05.650 --> 04:34:05.660 align:start position:0%
I won't read it word for word thank you
 
04:34:09.529 --> 04:34:09.539 align:start position:0%
yes but in preparation
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
um for this meeting I do want you to
 
04:34:14.570 --> 04:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
know the careful consideration and the
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
communication that we had with the
 
04:34:19.849 --> 04:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
preschool community so there is a lot
 
04:34:22.131 --> 04:34:22.141 align:start position:0%
going on the commissioner of Education
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
of Deputy Commissioner of education has
 
04:34:27.109 --> 04:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
been working with many groups with
 
04:34:30.410 --> 04:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
regard to this area as well and so I'm
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
sure she's here to answer any questions
 
04:34:35.209 --> 04:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
you might have to her too as well so New
 
04:34:38.631 --> 04:34:38.641 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is only one of Six States the
 
04:34:41.689 --> 04:34:41.699 align:start position:0%
previous information in the bill says
 
04:34:44.631 --> 04:34:44.641 align:start position:0%
seven states but since then
 
04:34:48.650 --> 04:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
um States like Colorado States like New
 
04:34:50.750 --> 04:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
Mexico actually New Mexico has just
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
passed one of the most aggressive
 
04:34:56.570 --> 04:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
preschool opportunities and access for
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
preschool education in the country
 
04:35:03.109 --> 04:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
so furthermore early care and education
 
04:35:08.090 --> 04:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
is critical for our Working Families it
 
04:35:11.631 --> 04:35:11.641 align:start position:0%
it's during covid so many women were
 
04:35:13.310 --> 04:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
pulled out of the workforce they weren't
 
04:35:15.230 --> 04:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
able to work the number of Early
 
04:35:15.240 --> 04:35:16.490 align:start position:0%
able to work the number of Early
Childhood

04:35:16.490 --> 04:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
Childhood
 
04:35:16.500 --> 04:35:17.150 align:start position:0%
Childhood
um

04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh placements
 
04:35:19.080 --> 04:35:19.910 align:start position:0%
uh placements
um

04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:23.330 --> 04:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh were lessened because of the fact of
 
04:35:26.449 --> 04:35:26.459 align:start position:0%
of covid and the difficulty of
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
everything going on and so we we were in
 
04:35:32.090 --> 04:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
this strange place right now where
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
things are getting better but there's
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
still repercussions from that
 
04:35:36.840 --> 04:35:38.769 align:start position:0%
still repercussions from that
so

04:35:38.769 --> 04:35:38.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:41.929 --> 04:35:41.939 align:start position:0%
hb620 will work toward offering three
 
04:35:43.730 --> 04:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
and four-year-old children a high
 
04:35:46.670 --> 04:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
quality pre-kindergarten experience and
 
04:35:49.810 --> 04:35:49.820 align:start position:0%
the formation of the Early Childhood Pro
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
Department to guide that pilot which I
 
04:35:57.170 --> 04:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
think is critical uh just to let you
 
04:35:59.449 --> 04:35:59.459 align:start position:0%
know I used to be
 
04:36:01.010 --> 04:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Commissioner at the New
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education and
 
04:36:06.650 --> 04:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
one of my conundrums during the time I
 
04:36:09.230 --> 04:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
worked at the department was that things
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
relative to preschool education would
 
04:36:13.209 --> 04:36:13.219 align:start position:0%
come up
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Education has
 
04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
absolutely no authority over anything
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
beyond kindergarten through age 12. so
 
04:36:24.230 --> 04:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
it was this kind of this gray area
 
04:36:26.330 --> 04:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
because we also had of the special
 
04:36:28.189 --> 04:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
education preschool grant money that
 
04:36:30.170 --> 04:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
came through us so there was an
 
04:36:33.609 --> 04:36:33.619 align:start position:0%
awkwardness to it so I'm hoping that um
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
hb620 will take us to a different place
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
and um we'll you will consider this
 
04:36:42.769 --> 04:36:42.779 align:start position:0%
opportunity it's so important for
 
04:36:45.709 --> 04:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
children in my city of Manchester to
 
04:36:48.890 --> 04:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
have high quality for all of them to
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
have a high quality access to programs
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
and to benefit from that program I think
 
04:36:55.369 --> 04:36:55.379 align:start position:0%
there are so many people that would
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
benefit from it but I am happy to
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
entertain questions
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:37:03.070 --> 04:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
um I have one question
 
04:37:06.670 --> 04:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
major organization initiatives like this
 
04:37:09.051 --> 04:37:09.061 align:start position:0%
generally succeed or fail with the
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
governor's support have you gotten
 
04:37:12.590 --> 04:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
support from the governor
 
04:37:12.600 --> 04:37:13.609 align:start position:0%
support from the governor
um

04:37:13.609 --> 04:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:19.029 --> 04:37:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
hb620 is also being introduced as a
 
04:37:26.209 --> 04:37:26.219 align:start position:0%
Senate bill in the other body and there
 
04:37:29.990 --> 04:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
are members that have had conversations
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have not had I am not aware that we
 
04:37:35.810 --> 04:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
have full support from the office of the
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
governor but I know that there are many
 
04:37:40.490 --> 04:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
people reaching out to him with regard
 
04:37:42.650 --> 04:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
to that matter
 
04:37:45.289 --> 04:37:45.299 align:start position:0%
thank you representative blackis and
 
04:37:48.769 --> 04:37:48.779 align:start position:0%
then hey bear thank you um you mentioned
 
04:37:51.289 --> 04:37:51.299 align:start position:0%
um studies that showed the benefit of
 
04:37:54.830 --> 04:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
this um if you have if you can I'd like
 
04:37:56.750 --> 04:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
you to send uh at least a link to the
 
04:37:58.849 --> 04:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
committee to the actual studies not
 
04:38:00.529 --> 04:38:00.539 align:start position:0%
articles about the studies but the
 
04:38:04.910 --> 04:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:06.410 --> 04:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
Madam chair
 
04:38:08.810 --> 04:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
I am I I like metrics a lot so when I
 
04:38:15.051 --> 04:38:15.061 align:start position:0%
hear that it will benefit many I I'd
 
04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
like a definition of many number one and
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
number two I noticed that this bill is a
 
04:38:22.250 --> 04:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal note introduced but I don't see
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
any monies as of yet thank you it is not
 
04:38:27.349 --> 04:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
and we have not seen the fiscal note yet
 
04:38:30.529 --> 04:38:30.539 align:start position:0%
I'm sure though when if it should pass
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
the house and it gets to fiscal we will
 
04:38:35.810 --> 04:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
have that note
 
04:38:37.970 --> 04:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
um we're assuming to set up a department
 
04:38:41.209 --> 04:38:41.219 align:start position:0%
would probably be a bureau Department
 
04:38:44.330 --> 04:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
whatever we end up doing
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
um would probably be about 500 000 the
 
04:38:51.170 --> 04:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
preschool the three-year preschool pilot
 
04:38:52.849 --> 04:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
um depending upon the communities we
 
04:38:55.609 --> 04:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
don't have an exact figure like that uh
 
04:38:57.769 --> 04:38:57.779 align:start position:0%
just yet but I'm assuming it will be
 
04:39:00.170 --> 04:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
anywhere between six and ten million
 
04:39:00.180 --> 04:39:03.830 align:start position:0%
anywhere between six and ten million
dollars

04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:07.490 --> 04:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt and
 
04:39:08.990 --> 04:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
then Gerhard
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I'm wondering
 
04:39:13.730 --> 04:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
over here always thank you
 
04:39:16.131 --> 04:39:16.141 align:start position:0%
voices coming out of the sky
 
04:39:16.141 --> 04:39:18.230 align:start position:0%
voices coming out of the sky
um

04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:20.330 --> 04:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why is it this in front of
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
Edna and not the education committee
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
well I asked that question to myself as
 
04:39:25.561 --> 04:39:26.390 align:start position:0%
well I asked that question to myself as
well

04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
um did yourself say and myself said to
 
04:39:33.230 --> 04:39:33.240 align:start position:0%
go and ask someone so I did and I was
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
told that because this should go to this
 
04:39:38.570 --> 04:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
committee because it is requesting
 
04:39:42.288 --> 04:39:42.298 align:start position:0%
um a a separate department or Bureau yes
 
04:39:44.270 --> 04:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
if they had simply said the Department
 
04:39:47.150 --> 04:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
of Education will run this pilot program
 
04:39:50.570 --> 04:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be involved right
 
04:39:53.810 --> 04:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
represent gerhardt
 
04:39:55.970 --> 04:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to find the actual Citation
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
for it right now thank you madam
 
04:40:00.410 --> 04:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
the I saw numbers that New Hampshire
 
04:40:03.050 --> 04:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
actually leads this Co the country with
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
declining Public School enrollment I
 
04:40:08.690 --> 04:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
think it's down 14 so
 
04:40:11.208 --> 04:40:11.218 align:start position:0%
is there any belief that this will be uh
 
04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
this will succumb to the same
 
04:40:15.530 --> 04:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
situation where just to be such a you
 
04:40:16.430 --> 04:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
already said there was a decline because
 
04:40:19.130 --> 04:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
the kova now slowly picking back up but
 
04:40:20.930 --> 04:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
if that Trend continues because at least
 
04:40:23.090 --> 04:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
in Northfield we have a completely open
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
school building it's just sitting there
 
04:40:27.050 --> 04:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
vacant right now so any comments on that
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
aspect the answer is yes New Hampshire
 
04:40:31.850 --> 04:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
does have declining student School
 
04:40:31.860 --> 04:40:34.310 align:start position:0%
does have declining student School
enrollment

04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
04:40:38.090 --> 04:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I hope that this
 
04:40:41.150 --> 04:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
bill will promote will be a preschool
 
04:40:43.250 --> 04:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
program that would also attract young
 
04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
families from other states to actually
 
04:40:47.448 --> 04:40:47.458 align:start position:0%
move to the state of New Hampshire New
 
04:40:49.610 --> 04:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I believe is the second oldest
 
04:40:49.620 --> 04:40:50.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I believe is the second oldest
state

04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and we could benefit from attracting
 
04:40:55.970 --> 04:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
younger people to the state of New
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we also have a problem with
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
our younger people going to other states
 
04:41:03.288 --> 04:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
to live so I think by offering these
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of programs we bring more people
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
in it would attract younger families and
 
04:41:09.948 --> 04:41:09.958 align:start position:0%
we probably wouldn't be the second
 
04:41:12.288 --> 04:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
oldest state in the country
 
04:41:15.410 --> 04:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
I hope you know thank you representative
 
04:41:18.050 --> 04:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair um so this
 
04:41:19.250 --> 04:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
is going to be a three-year pilot
 
04:41:20.690 --> 04:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
program yes
 
04:41:20.700 --> 04:41:21.288 align:start position:0%
program yes
um

04:41:21.288 --> 04:41:21.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
is three years a sufficient amount of
 
04:41:25.788 --> 04:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
time to gain any understanding of the
 
04:41:27.890 --> 04:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
success of the program
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you remember
 
04:41:33.050 --> 04:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
um representative Mary Stuart guile
 
04:41:35.330 --> 04:41:35.340 align:start position:0%
um Mary Stuart geil had submitted a
 
04:41:38.690 --> 04:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
similar Bill to like this many years ago
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
the conversation is that a three-year
 
04:41:44.330 --> 04:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
pilot would indeed give us a good sense
 
04:41:47.570 --> 04:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
of what would work and again this is a a
 
04:41:47.580 --> 04:41:48.770 align:start position:0%
of what would work and again this is a a
mixed

04:41:48.770 --> 04:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
mixed
 
04:41:51.650 --> 04:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
um Community program so each Community
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be different and each
 
04:41:54.830 --> 04:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
program would look a little bit
 
04:41:57.230 --> 04:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
different so if we're our thought
 
04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
process is that we'd probably look at
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
two rural areas and two uh bigger areas
 
04:42:05.868 --> 04:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
to try out the pilot so we'd get a sense
 
04:42:07.610 --> 04:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
of what it would look like but we think
 
04:42:11.390 --> 04:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify the question the
 
04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
argument is that by providing quality
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
preschool we're going to see success in
 
04:42:20.990 --> 04:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
the student over the long term we're
 
04:42:22.490 --> 04:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
going to get a good result by the end
 
04:42:25.010 --> 04:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
and whereas you're arguably starting at
 
04:42:26.868 --> 04:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
the latest age with a four or
 
04:42:28.970 --> 04:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
five-year-old that brings you to the to
 
04:42:32.448 --> 04:42:32.458 align:start position:0%
age eight not age 18 so how are we going
 
04:42:34.850 --> 04:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
to track the long-term benefits of
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
whether or not that had an impact you
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
know within the three-year term well
 
04:42:40.850 --> 04:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
there are lots of different ways to
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
track the progress of children we have
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire State assessment
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's one methodology we have ongoing
 
04:42:49.850 --> 04:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
local assessments that schools
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
um apply we also have graduation rates
 
04:42:55.850 --> 04:42:55.860 align:start position:0%
um the rate at which
 
04:42:58.368 --> 04:42:58.378 align:start position:0%
students finish High School in four
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
years the percentage of students going
 
04:43:03.288 --> 04:43:03.298 align:start position:0%
on to a four-year college so there are
 
04:43:06.410 --> 04:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
lots of ways they're long it's a
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
long-term look but there has been a long
 
04:43:14.810 --> 04:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
term the 50 years actually of long-term
 
04:43:18.590 --> 04:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
look at at kindergarten programs in
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
early childhood programs in relation to
 
04:43:23.770 --> 04:43:23.780 align:start position:0%
Children's success as they enter school
 
04:43:26.930 --> 04:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
and that they're reading at grade level
 
04:43:31.010 --> 04:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
by grade three so we do have some
 
04:43:34.250 --> 04:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
information that would be a strong
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
indicator of long-term success there are
 
04:43:40.190 --> 04:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of factors that happen along the
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
way for children but in terms of giving
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
them the best possible start is a good
 
04:43:49.970 --> 04:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
way to make sure that we're giving them
 
04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
the highest potential for success over
 
04:43:55.730 --> 04:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
their school years thank you
 
04:43:58.368 --> 04:43:58.378 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien thank you madam
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
04:44:03.010 --> 04:44:03.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I'm wondering why
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
you're going to establish its own
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
separate Department why did you not go
 
04:44:10.850 --> 04:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
within the Avenue of going under the
 
04:44:13.730 --> 04:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
Department of Education would that not
 
04:44:16.368 --> 04:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
have been more efficient to the taxpayer
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
and also provide a cohesive oversight of
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
the program as well
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
well three and four-year-olds don't live
 
04:44:28.368 --> 04:44:28.378 align:start position:0%
in the department of Ed
 
04:44:30.970 --> 04:44:30.980 align:start position:0%
um a lot of
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
issues that relate to them reside in
 
04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
04:44:41.090 --> 04:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
and as I said earlier it's a bit of a
 
04:44:43.128 --> 04:44:43.138 align:start position:0%
conundrum that the department of
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
education does not have
 
04:44:48.170 --> 04:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
Authority for students
 
04:44:50.930 --> 04:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
their Authority ranges from K through
 
04:44:50.940 --> 04:44:52.128 align:start position:0%
their Authority ranges from K through
12.

04:44:52.128 --> 04:44:52.138 align:start position:0%
12.
 
04:44:54.288 --> 04:44:54.298 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education doesn't have
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
authority but below that so in
 
04:45:02.770 --> 04:45:02.780 align:start position:0%
developing its own Bureau or Department
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
what we have is a unique situation with
 
04:45:10.310 --> 04:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
children needing the educational
 
04:45:13.010 --> 04:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
environment and needing some of the
 
04:45:15.410 --> 04:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
elements of Health and Human Services so
 
04:45:17.750 --> 04:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
by creating an early childhood
 
04:45:20.208 --> 04:45:20.218 align:start position:0%
Department which many many states have
 
04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
done I don't have the exact number with
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
me right now but I think the Deputy
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioner has that information
 
04:45:28.788 --> 04:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
would be a benefit it would be a focus
 
04:45:31.550 --> 04:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
on our early childhood children I think
 
04:45:33.650 --> 04:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
it would be a benefit to the Department
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
of Ed to Health and Human Services and
 
04:45:39.050 --> 04:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
parents and school districts
 
04:45:40.910 --> 04:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
04:45:43.070 --> 04:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
well I'm a little confusing could you
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
help me out because I'm thinking it
 
04:45:47.750 --> 04:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't already am I correct in saying
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
that it already exists and
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
a situation where the child is three
 
04:45:55.850 --> 04:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
years old been identified as a special
 
04:45:59.628 --> 04:45:59.638 align:start position:0%
needs student yes and they are accepted
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
within the educational program yes and
 
04:46:05.510 --> 04:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
some communities such as in Nashua they
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
do open it up they do our typical
 
04:46:11.090 --> 04:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
development yes where and that's a
 
04:46:13.670 --> 04:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
brilliant way of handling things so I
 
04:46:15.170 --> 04:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
was under the assumption that it's
 
04:46:18.530 --> 04:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
already there it's not many school
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
districts do have an integrated
 
04:46:21.480 --> 04:46:22.730 align:start position:0%
districts do have an integrated
preschool

04:46:22.730 --> 04:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
preschool
 
04:46:26.090 --> 04:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
many do because there are preschool
 
04:46:28.970 --> 04:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
special education funds and also under
 
04:46:30.890 --> 04:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
the federal legislation for No Child
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
Left Behind
 
04:46:35.690 --> 04:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry that's not the legislation
 
04:46:37.750 --> 04:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
now it's the Essa act and it's under
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
esea that was passed in 1965.
 
04:46:44.510 --> 04:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
um under that legislation that is uh
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
that also allows for funds to be used
 
04:46:48.410 --> 04:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
for early childhood
 
04:46:51.708 --> 04:46:51.718 align:start position:0%
so yes in fact that those funds could be
 
04:46:53.690 --> 04:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
used in that area
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up so you're saying like in a
 
04:46:58.390 --> 04:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
situation of Medicare can be applied
 
04:47:02.288 --> 04:47:02.298 align:start position:0%
underneath your bill if if the child is
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
identified as special needs and would
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
typically uh developmental type of
 
04:47:10.730 --> 04:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
children that you would reap the
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
Medicare benefits which would lower your
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative O'Brien you're
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
talking Medicaid Medicaid very few
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
children are over 65. yeah that's true
 
04:47:22.850 --> 04:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
you know Madam chair thank you so much
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
I'm over 65 I'm I'm in the block but I'm
 
04:47:28.190 --> 04:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
sure the representative know what I
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
meant I still understand what but
 
04:47:31.970 --> 04:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
actually some we're talking about the
 
04:47:32.820 --> 04:47:32.830 align:start position:0%
kids with a beard
 
04:47:32.830 --> 04:47:37.128 align:start position:0%
kids with a beard
[Laughter]

04:47:37.128 --> 04:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
um there are children that are eligible
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and they're Regional agencies that
 
04:47:47.330 --> 04:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
become involved at actually at the if a
 
04:47:49.250 --> 04:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
child is born with a significant
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
disability the regional area kicks in at
 
04:47:55.550 --> 04:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
that time and then when a child is three
 
04:47:58.868 --> 04:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
the age of three the special ed law
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
comes into place and that's where the
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
child is eligible
 
04:48:04.320 --> 04:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
child is eligible
um so

04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:48:09.530 --> 04:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
in reality I not exactly sure of the
 
04:48:12.650 --> 04:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
answer to would they be eligible to be
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for the expenses
 
04:48:18.650 --> 04:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
um based on their disability I think the
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
answer is probably yes but I I don't
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
there are other people here that I think
 
04:48:24.350 --> 04:48:24.360 align:start position:0%
could definitively answer that better
 
04:48:25.730 --> 04:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
than I
 
04:48:27.410 --> 04:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you thank you
 
04:48:30.410 --> 04:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and then Gould
 
04:48:32.208 --> 04:48:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you is this going to a
 
04:48:36.050 --> 04:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh uh yes okay thank you
 
04:48:38.810 --> 04:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
representative gold I just wanted to add
 
04:48:40.910 --> 04:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
on to that so Federal funding that's
 
04:48:42.288 --> 04:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
already coming to the state for these
 
04:48:44.750 --> 04:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
Services I'm assuming fiscal committee
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
and and the and the money managers would
 
04:48:50.090 --> 04:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
be part of what funded this but it would
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
give it a department to manage the money
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
yes this will be coming to fiscal
 
04:48:55.628 --> 04:48:55.638 align:start position:0%
if if
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes Finance
 
04:49:01.970 --> 04:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I have uh an additional
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
question uh I know you said this was
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
being introduced as a Senate bill and I
 
04:49:10.550 --> 04:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
noticed that Senate Bill 214 has the
 
04:49:12.948 --> 04:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
exact same language why should we bother
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
to do anything with this if the Senate
 
04:49:17.150 --> 04:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
is going to do it because
 
04:49:19.788 --> 04:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
with all due respect what a strong
 
04:49:21.770 --> 04:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
message that the house could send to the
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
Senate and we'd come together and have a
 
04:49:28.430 --> 04:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation bill with um I think it
 
04:49:31.730 --> 04:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
sends a strong message to our state
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative leckis
 
04:49:37.190 --> 04:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I I share
 
04:49:39.350 --> 04:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
um an earlier concern with the ability
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
to really tell if this works in three
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
years and I want to see you know if you
 
04:49:46.730 --> 04:49:46.740 align:start position:0%
can allay my concerns I've seen studies
 
04:49:48.170 --> 04:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
that show that
 
04:49:51.288 --> 04:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
Head Start results in a an improvement
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
for the first few years but longer term
 
04:49:57.288 --> 04:49:57.298 align:start position:0%
uh you know the results revert to the
 
04:49:59.868 --> 04:49:59.878 align:start position:0%
mean and it has no long-term benefit and
 
04:50:01.368 --> 04:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned that this would do the
 
04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
same why why should I believe that's not
 
04:50:06.170 --> 04:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
going to be the case especially with
 
04:50:09.890 --> 04:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
only a three-year period to evaluate
 
04:50:12.650 --> 04:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
I will send you your a lot of research
 
04:50:14.930 --> 04:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
out there
 
04:50:16.910 --> 04:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are things that happen along the
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
way in a child's life that can disrupt
 
04:50:22.490 --> 04:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
their progress in school I I don't think
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's anything that we could do
 
04:50:30.788 --> 04:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
um to avoid that I think life happens
 
04:50:33.770 --> 04:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
people their parents might be in an
 
04:50:36.110 --> 04:50:36.120 align:start position:0%
accident and die and that that could
 
04:50:39.470 --> 04:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
cause serious problems but that said by
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
providing high quality
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
Early Childhood we are giving those
 
04:50:48.530 --> 04:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
three and four-year-olds the highest
 
04:50:51.650 --> 04:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
potential for success in future years
 
04:50:53.690 --> 04:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
I'll take a look at what you sent me
 
04:50:57.470 --> 04:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you okay represent Gerhard
 
04:50:58.730 --> 04:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
quick question for you thank you madam
 
04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
chair is it possible for Manchester to
 
04:51:01.970 --> 04:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
Institute this on their own without
 
04:51:04.128 --> 04:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
State can you just do this by yourselves
 
04:51:05.810 --> 04:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
at the local level or is this you need
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester does have an integrated
 
04:51:14.030 --> 04:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
preschool program
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
but the program that we are discussing
 
04:51:18.770 --> 04:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
would be a program that would give all
 
04:51:21.050 --> 04:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
Manchester children for those parents so
 
04:51:23.810 --> 04:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
choosing access to this program right
 
04:51:23.820 --> 04:51:24.770 align:start position:0%
choosing access to this program right
now

04:51:24.770 --> 04:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
um it is my understanding and we have a
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
school board member here who could
 
04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
probably answer that question better
 
04:51:31.430 --> 04:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
that I
 
04:51:33.650 --> 04:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:51:33.660 --> 04:51:34.970 align:start position:0%
um the the
this

04:51:34.970 --> 04:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:51:39.770 --> 04:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
bill is more toward access for as many
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
children as possible whereas uh the the
 
04:51:44.280 --> 04:51:46.430 align:start position:0%
children as possible whereas uh the the
local

04:51:46.430 --> 04:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:51:46.440 --> 04:51:47.110 align:start position:0%
local
um

04:51:47.110 --> 04:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:47.120 --> 04:51:48.948 align:start position:0%
um
municipality

04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
04:51:52.430 --> 04:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
probably I don't know if they would be
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
able to take on that initiative
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
just based on the cost alone
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
all right thank you just follow up
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
follow up my concern is just putting the
 
04:52:04.250 --> 04:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
power at the hands of the state when
 
04:52:05.930 --> 04:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
they miss the local elements have the
 
04:52:06.948 --> 04:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
most control over it and know what's
 
04:52:08.810 --> 04:52:08.820 align:start position:0%
going right wrong and so forth so that's
 
04:52:09.948 --> 04:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
that's where I was going with that thank
 
04:52:09.958 --> 04:52:11.208 align:start position:0%
that's where I was going with that thank
you

04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes other questions uh representative
 
04:52:17.208 --> 04:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
again uh thank you um kind of a related
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
question I see that uh departments only
 
04:52:22.250 --> 04:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
requiring a 10 match
 
04:52:25.610 --> 04:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
I assume that's from uh the local school
 
04:52:28.010 --> 04:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
district and it doesn't have to be cash
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
it can be in kind yes
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
um that's concerning I mean you know why
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
why should that be less than the portion
 
04:52:37.010 --> 04:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
of Education that's coming from the
 
04:52:40.128 --> 04:52:40.138 align:start position:0%
state versus the school district for all
 
04:52:41.570 --> 04:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
the other kids
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot it's an incentive to get
 
04:52:45.240 --> 04:52:47.390 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot it's an incentive to get
more

04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
school districts engaged if in fact we
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
were to go forward remember how long it
 
04:52:55.010 --> 04:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
took us to get full to get kindergarten
 
04:52:57.230 --> 04:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
in place and then full day kindergarten
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
we still don't have every school
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
district in the state that's right now
 
04:53:01.490 --> 04:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of full day
 
04:53:05.090 --> 04:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
kindergarten thank you
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
04:53:09.410 --> 04:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you thank
 
04:53:10.730 --> 04:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
I believe you said that uh Department of
 
04:53:15.410 --> 04:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
Education can't do something like this
 
04:53:17.090 --> 04:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the authority
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
for three and four-year-olds so in
 
04:53:22.128 --> 04:53:22.138 align:start position:0%
setting up this department this is a
 
04:53:24.170 --> 04:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
department setup outside of the
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
04:53:27.350 --> 04:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
um that has not been determined yet I
 
04:53:28.550 --> 04:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
think that will be something that will
 
04:53:30.170 --> 04:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
be worked out
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
but it will be its own entity and I
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
again the Deputy Commissioner is here so
 
04:53:36.948 --> 04:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps she could answer that better
 
04:53:40.550 --> 04:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
well as written it creates a department
 
04:53:44.810 --> 04:53:44.820 align:start position:0%
parallel to the Department of Education
 
04:53:47.930 --> 04:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
and not subordinate to it
 
04:53:51.650 --> 04:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
so representative Schmidt
 
04:53:54.288 --> 04:53:54.298 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
um the the thing the thought that's been
 
04:53:59.628 --> 04:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
rattling around in my brain ever since
 
04:54:02.330 --> 04:54:02.340 align:start position:0%
we started talking about this is that
 
04:54:02.340 --> 04:54:03.890 align:start position:0%
we started talking about this is that
uh

04:54:03.890 --> 04:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:07.628 --> 04:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
three and four-year-old children uh are
 
04:54:10.850 --> 04:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
obviously the developmental aspect we're
 
04:54:13.190 --> 04:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
all I think familiar with it there's a
 
04:54:15.948 --> 04:54:15.958 align:start position:0%
tremendous brain development so they are
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
learning but they're also and not very
 
04:54:20.810 --> 04:54:20.820 align:start position:0%
competent in terms of
 
04:54:23.530 --> 04:54:23.540 align:start position:0%
other skills
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
toileting you know taking care of
 
04:54:29.448 --> 04:54:29.458 align:start position:0%
interacting with other kids and so forth
 
04:54:33.708 --> 04:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
and so on that it it and that's why I
 
04:54:35.930 --> 04:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the fact that this
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
has come into committee that
 
04:54:40.190 --> 04:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
does not have any expertise in this I
 
04:54:42.410 --> 04:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
understand that we're only opining on
 
04:54:44.090 --> 04:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
the idea of adding an additional
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
department but
 
04:54:47.708 --> 04:54:47.718 align:start position:0%
uh is this something
 
04:54:50.090 --> 04:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
I know you spoke about this a little bit
 
04:54:51.650 --> 04:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
at the beginning but
 
04:54:53.868 --> 04:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
how many other states are doing this
 
04:54:55.490 --> 04:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and what do we know about
 
04:54:55.500 --> 04:54:56.448 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and what do we know about
them

04:54:56.448 --> 04:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:54:56.458 --> 04:55:03.470 align:start position:0%
them
well

04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:07.490 --> 04:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
states have some level of earning early
 
04:55:07.500 --> 04:55:09.170 align:start position:0%
states have some level of earning early
childhood

04:55:09.170 --> 04:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
childhood
 
04:55:15.470 --> 04:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.930 --> 04:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
well what is their experience with that
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know child care it's either going to
 
04:55:24.650 --> 04:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
the child is either going to get care
 
04:55:28.128 --> 04:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
from his or her parents if they are able
 
04:55:30.350 --> 04:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
to have Mom at home or dad at home or
 
04:55:33.110 --> 04:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
whatever but
 
04:55:33.120 --> 04:55:34.368 align:start position:0%
whatever but
um

04:55:34.368 --> 04:55:34.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:34.378 --> 04:55:35.170 align:start position:0%
um
um

04:55:35.170 --> 04:55:35.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:38.868 --> 04:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
many many very young children are with a
 
04:55:42.590 --> 04:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
caregiver not necessarily an educator so
 
04:55:45.788 --> 04:55:45.798 align:start position:0%
I realize there's a real Gap in terms of
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
what the cross-section of children are
 
04:55:52.430 --> 04:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
getting but I'll be happy in the whole
 
04:55:55.128 --> 04:55:55.138 align:start position:0%
committee I have um just from the
 
04:55:56.930 --> 04:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
international committee that I've been
 
04:55:58.788 --> 04:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
working on I have a number of different
 
04:56:01.490 --> 04:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
articles and information that relates to
 
04:56:04.190 --> 04:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
the research and data that I can send to
 
04:56:05.930 --> 04:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
all of you I didn't want to inundate you
 
04:56:08.208 --> 04:56:08.218 align:start position:0%
with too much information up front so
 
04:56:10.670 --> 04:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to and I think the um
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
others that are here today might be able
 
04:56:15.470 --> 04:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
to even point to other information as
 
04:56:15.480 --> 04:56:16.368 align:start position:0%
to even point to other information as
well

04:56:16.368 --> 04:56:16.378 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:56:19.128 --> 04:56:19.138 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and uh this will be
 
04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
going to representative broader
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on state or organization
 
04:56:27.530 --> 04:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:30.410 --> 04:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative blackis thank you
 
04:56:33.288 --> 04:56:33.298 align:start position:0%
um I mean the previous question raised
 
04:56:34.850 --> 04:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
04:56:36.830 --> 04:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
an interesting point that we're you know
 
04:56:38.930 --> 04:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
education really isn't in our our
 
04:56:40.310 --> 04:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse is this going to go before
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
the education committee
 
04:56:45.170 --> 04:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
we don't it's an early Bill we don't
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
know where it's going okay okay thank
 
04:56:49.910 --> 04:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you I mean that's that's the
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
case we never know what word committee
 
04:56:53.628 --> 04:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
is going to and thank you for hearing my
 
04:56:55.970 --> 04:56:55.980 align:start position:0%
testimony I hope you
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
can thank you representative Heath
 
04:57:09.650 --> 04:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:11.208 --> 04:57:11.218 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and the rest of
 
04:57:13.250 --> 04:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Sean Parr I'm
 
04:57:15.288 --> 04:57:15.298 align:start position:0%
on the Manchester School Board uh where
 
04:57:17.090 --> 04:57:17.100 align:start position:0%
I sit on the policy committee and chair
 
04:57:18.890 --> 04:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
the education legislation committee
 
04:57:21.110 --> 04:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
today I'm speaking on behalf of the
 
04:57:22.910 --> 04:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester School Board which has
 
04:57:25.010 --> 04:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
authorized me to advocate for funding
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
for Universal Pre-K Pre-K programming
 
04:57:29.810 --> 04:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
and related facilities costs we are
 
04:57:32.270 --> 04:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
therefore unanimous in our support of
 
04:57:33.948 --> 04:57:33.958 align:start position:0%
the Pre-K pilot program and the
 
04:57:35.448 --> 04:57:35.458 align:start position:0%
establishment of a department of early
 
04:57:39.050 --> 04:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
childhood education as proposed in hb620
 
04:57:41.330 --> 04:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
Pre-K education mitigates the effects of
 
04:57:43.250 --> 04:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
poverty and adversity on our children
 
04:57:44.690 --> 04:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
especially benefiting our English
 
04:57:46.970 --> 04:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
language Learners as well as our poor
 
04:57:49.070 --> 04:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
and disadvantaged children our current
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
lack of affordable Early Learning
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
options short changes our children and
 
04:57:55.310 --> 04:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
research shows clearly that high quality
 
04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
Early Education can improve High School
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
graduation rates and future employment
 
04:58:01.850 --> 04:58:01.860 align:start position:0%
income it leads to long-term educational
 
04:58:03.650 --> 04:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
attainment gains through improvements in
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
behavior and it allows children to grow
 
04:58:07.550 --> 04:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
up to raise stronger families and
 
04:58:09.650 --> 04:58:09.660 align:start position:0%
contribute to society we need to give
 
04:58:11.270 --> 04:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
our children the kind of care and early
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
learning they need to fulfill their
 
04:58:15.708 --> 04:58:15.718 align:start position:0%
their potential kids who attend public
 
04:58:17.390 --> 04:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
preschool programs are better prepared
 
04:58:19.970 --> 04:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
for kindergarten than kids who don't we
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
ask for your support of this bill thanks
 
04:58:23.690 --> 04:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
for your consideration
 
04:58:25.490 --> 04:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
04:58:28.730 --> 04:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Schmidt
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so it's interesting that
 
04:58:34.810 --> 04:58:34.820 align:start position:0%
you're coming in strong support
 
04:58:38.090 --> 04:58:38.100 align:start position:0%
that that clearly has value in our
 
04:58:40.788 --> 04:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
decision making but the question I have
 
04:58:44.030 --> 04:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
is is there the instrumentality out
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
there in terms of
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
people who are trained to take care of
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
and educate because this is not just
 
04:58:52.970 --> 04:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
taking care of kids right this is
 
04:58:55.850 --> 04:58:55.860 align:start position:0%
supposed to be educating them uh is
 
04:58:59.628 --> 04:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
there is there the staff and support
 
04:59:02.990 --> 04:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
experience available in this state to do
 
04:59:03.000 --> 04:59:04.788 align:start position:0%
experience available in this state to do
that

04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:07.490 --> 04:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
I believe so I mean we already we as uh
 
04:59:08.810 --> 04:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
representative Heath mentioned we do
 
04:59:11.448 --> 04:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
have some Pre-K programs for special
 
04:59:13.310 --> 04:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
needs children already and we do have
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
staff that teach and and run those
 
04:59:18.368 --> 04:59:18.378 align:start position:0%
programs there our administrative
 
04:59:20.810 --> 04:59:20.820 align:start position:0%
infrastructure would allow for including
 
04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
additional staff members for this pilot
 
04:59:24.890 --> 04:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
for sure yes
 
04:59:27.170 --> 04:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
could you opine on what the rest of the
 
04:59:29.628 --> 04:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
state because of Manchester is a kind of
 
04:59:32.090 --> 04:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
a world unto itself what the rest of the
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
state might be capable of doing I mean I
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
think that's a difficult question I
 
04:59:37.610 --> 04:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
think that there are Workforce shortages
 
04:59:39.770 --> 04:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
in so many different fields across so
 
04:59:41.330 --> 04:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
many different areas of the state and
 
04:59:43.730 --> 04:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
the country right now that it would be a
 
04:59:46.190 --> 04:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
little bit presumptuous of me to to
 
04:59:49.208 --> 04:59:49.218 align:start position:0%
speculate on that uh I think
 
04:59:52.550 --> 04:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh we've had success with incentivizing
 
04:59:55.788 --> 04:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
staff uh applications for staff with uh
 
04:59:57.708 --> 04:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
with uh hiring bonuses and retention
 
04:59:59.690 --> 04:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
bonuses in the past year and that's been
 
05:00:01.730 --> 05:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
successful in fully Staffing our our
 
05:00:03.650 --> 05:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
district right now
 
05:00:05.448 --> 05:00:05.458 align:start position:0%
um and maybe just to address one of your
 
05:00:07.970 --> 05:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
earlier points there about Manchester it
 
05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
is unique right it is the largest
 
05:00:12.770 --> 05:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
District in the State uh with 12 300
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
students in our district but it's also
 
05:00:17.330 --> 05:00:17.340 align:start position:0%
the most diverse City in this in the
 
05:00:19.250 --> 05:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
state right and so almost half of our
 
05:00:21.948 --> 05:00:21.958 align:start position:0%
students are non-white students many
 
05:00:23.448 --> 05:00:23.458 align:start position:0%
coming from our City's Refugee
 
05:00:26.030 --> 05:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
population so there are many learning
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
challenges that happen when those
 
05:00:30.110 --> 05:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
children enter our schools right and so
 
05:00:31.610 --> 05:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
that kind of immediate immersion
 
05:00:33.530 --> 05:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
requires a lot of support so we are
 
05:00:36.350 --> 05:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
definitely used to adding supports for
 
05:00:38.628 --> 05:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
our students there and that's why this
 
05:00:40.250 --> 05:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
kind of a bill can make a huge
 
05:00:41.868 --> 05:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
difference for our students there by
 
05:00:44.270 --> 05:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
introducing them to the structure of
 
05:00:47.628 --> 05:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
school the acclimation to the English
 
05:00:50.948 --> 05:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
language and that kind of regular
 
05:00:53.208 --> 05:00:53.218 align:start position:0%
exposure to socializing with other
 
05:00:55.490 --> 05:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
children learning the alphabet sooner
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
early literacy all of those things so
 
05:00:59.930 --> 05:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
this would be a real game changer for
 
05:01:01.730 --> 05:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
students in our city and I think across
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up thank you so the thing is
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
uh if you're already kind of doing this
 
05:01:11.990 --> 05:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
then you're already definitely spending
 
05:01:16.190 --> 05:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
money on it and and uh so that means
 
05:01:20.030 --> 05:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
more more money out of taxpayers pockets
 
05:01:22.010 --> 05:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
right that's where it's coming so the
 
05:01:24.890 --> 05:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
funding for pre pre-K in Manchester is
 
05:01:27.410 --> 05:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
solely from federal funding it's not
 
05:01:30.288 --> 05:01:30.298 align:start position:0%
from local taxation so right now we are
 
05:01:31.850 --> 05:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
only using federal funds that's why the
 
05:01:34.128 --> 05:01:34.138 align:start position:0%
program is limited the access is very
 
05:01:36.410 --> 05:01:36.420 align:start position:0%
limited to certain students who have
 
05:01:39.128 --> 05:01:39.138 align:start position:0%
certain needs or qualify under certain
 
05:01:43.128 --> 05:01:43.138 align:start position:0%
uh poverty limits so it's a very limited
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
program right now you can the access is
 
05:01:47.270 --> 05:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
extremely limited so that's why as
 
05:01:48.830 --> 05:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Heath mentioned there the
 
05:01:50.868 --> 05:01:50.878 align:start position:0%
access is the key word there that
 
05:01:53.570 --> 05:01:53.580 align:start position:0%
increasing access to pre-k is extremely
 
05:01:55.250 --> 05:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
important so so you're looking I know
 
05:01:57.890 --> 05:01:57.900 align:start position:0%
it's going to supplement the uh correct
 
05:02:00.410 --> 05:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
federal funds thank you any other
 
05:02:02.270 --> 05:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr Parr representative
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair how long
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
have you guys been running your uh
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
preschool program it's it's predates my
 
05:02:11.208 --> 05:02:11.218 align:start position:0%
time on the board so I would say it's
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
been several years several years being a
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school do you have any
 
05:02:17.150 --> 05:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
data that you'd be able to share with us
 
05:02:20.050 --> 05:02:20.060 align:start position:0%
to show how that program is impacting
 
05:02:22.550 --> 05:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
long-term educational outcomes and
 
05:02:24.590 --> 05:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
graduation rates I can look up that data
 
05:02:26.628 --> 05:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
and I can I can find I can ask the
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent to see if we can share
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
that with the committee that'd be very
 
05:02:30.770 --> 05:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
05:02:32.570 --> 05:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
another question
 
05:02:34.730 --> 05:02:34.740 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you madam
 
05:02:36.590 --> 05:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
chair a lot of what you described
 
05:02:38.810 --> 05:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
socialization learning all that stuff
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't don't um I don't want to say just
 
05:02:43.010 --> 05:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
religious but social groups and
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
organizations do that within the city as
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
well or is there just a void where
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
that's not filled at all
 
05:02:50.930 --> 05:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
I mean I would say the answer is yes to
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
both I mean there are yes organizations
 
05:02:55.750 --> 05:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
do some of that work right but
 
05:02:58.610 --> 05:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
parents are often
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
in need of wanting more of those options
 
05:03:02.570 --> 05:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
and more of those choices for their
 
05:03:04.368 --> 05:03:04.378 align:start position:0%
children right and and it is very
 
05:03:07.150 --> 05:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
expensive to put your children into
 
05:03:09.830 --> 05:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
Pre-K programs for three-year-olds
 
05:03:11.990 --> 05:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
four-year-olds and earlier
 
05:03:12.000 --> 05:03:13.190 align:start position:0%
four-year-olds and earlier
um

05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:15.830 --> 05:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
the kind of regular those organizations
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
are also usually one or two days a week
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is which this would be more days
 
05:03:22.250 --> 05:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
per week than that more hours per day in
 
05:03:25.010 --> 05:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
those situations a much more sustained
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
routinized uh longer lasting impact
 
05:03:32.030 --> 05:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you other
 
05:03:34.128 --> 05:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:03:34.138 --> 05:03:35.690 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
much

05:03:35.690 --> 05:03:35.700 align:start position:0%

unnoticed by people in this state so
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%

so
 
05:04:14.090 --> 05:04:14.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to read my testimony
 
05:04:15.708 --> 05:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
but I'm just going to read the first
 
05:04:15.718 --> 05:04:17.448 align:start position:0%
but I'm just going to read the first
paragraph

05:04:17.448 --> 05:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
05:04:20.448 --> 05:04:20.458 align:start position:0%
um scan is the acronym for Save the
 
05:04:22.010 --> 05:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
Children Action Network and we're the
 
05:04:24.350 --> 05:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
political arm of save the children and
 
05:04:26.448 --> 05:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
we work to build bipartisan support to
 
05:04:28.250 --> 05:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
make sure every child has a strong start
 
05:04:30.770 --> 05:04:30.780 align:start position:0%
in life we've been saved the children
 
05:04:32.570 --> 05:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's been around for over 100 years but
 
05:04:34.190 --> 05:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
scan has been in New Hampshire since
 
05:04:34.200 --> 05:04:36.410 align:start position:0%
scan has been in New Hampshire since
2014.

05:04:36.410 --> 05:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
2014.
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
so I want to tell you what I did
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
in 2020 I saw a movie called starting at
 
05:04:43.920 --> 05:04:45.070 align:start position:0%
in 2020 I saw a movie called starting at
zero

05:04:45.070 --> 05:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
zero
 
05:04:49.910 --> 05:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
whoa this movie was incredible it was by
 
05:04:52.850 --> 05:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
a documentary filmmaker a woman who by
 
05:04:56.208 --> 05:04:56.218 align:start position:0%
the way did her internship at nhpr
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
she now lives in Rhode Island
 
05:05:02.270 --> 05:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
and she highlighted the states that have
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
gotten this done
 
05:05:07.550 --> 05:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
and primarily she highlighted Alabama
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
so I called her and I said can we get
 
05:05:13.368 --> 05:05:13.378 align:start position:0%
together I want to know more about the
 
05:05:16.070 --> 05:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
work that you've researched your film is
 
05:05:16.080 --> 05:05:17.330 align:start position:0%
work that you've researched your film is
incredible

05:05:17.330 --> 05:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
incredible
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
so she said well let's do one better
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'll come to New Hampshire so she's
 
05:05:24.050 --> 05:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
supported by a foundation and then she
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
came to New Hampshire and she brought
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
with her the commissioner of the newly
 
05:05:33.170 --> 05:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
formed Department of early childhood
 
05:05:35.570 --> 05:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
education in Alabama her name is Gina
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
Ross Commissioner Ross they came to New
 
05:05:41.330 --> 05:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in September we showed the
 
05:05:44.090 --> 05:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
film at Red River Theaters we had about
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
a hundred people there and then we had a
 
05:05:49.910 --> 05:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
panel discussion after and we said how
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
do we get this done in New Hampshire so
 
05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
many other states are getting it done
 
05:05:56.868 --> 05:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
help us get this done so since then
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
Alabama has offered us free technical
 
05:06:01.730 --> 05:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
assistance this Foundation pays for it
 
05:06:05.150 --> 05:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
and Gina Ross I called her yesterday I
 
05:06:06.708 --> 05:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
said I need to know the return on
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
investment I want to put that in my
 
05:06:09.770 --> 05:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
testimony she said okay I'll send it to
 
05:06:12.050 --> 05:06:12.060 align:start position:0%
you right now she's been in an
 
05:06:15.170 --> 05:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
incredible help to us and has offered to
 
05:06:17.208 --> 05:06:17.218 align:start position:0%
stay on board to help us they are one
 
05:06:19.070 --> 05:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
one of the poorest states in the country
 
05:06:21.890 --> 05:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
and she has figured out how to blend and
 
05:06:21.900 --> 05:06:23.170 align:start position:0%
and she has figured out how to blend and
braid

05:06:23.170 --> 05:06:23.180 align:start position:0%
braid
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
finances to get it done in that state
 
05:06:27.650 --> 05:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
she said you guys are like the seventh
 
05:06:29.390 --> 05:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
richest state in the country if we can
 
05:06:31.610 --> 05:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
get it done you can get it done
 
05:06:33.948 --> 05:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
so they have done a lot of research
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
about the return on investment about the
 
05:06:38.570 --> 05:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
dollar return about the kids that
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
actually graduate from high school that
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
weren't graduating from high school so I
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
do have some of that for you but what
 
05:06:48.050 --> 05:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
the foundation did was they knew you
 
05:06:50.270 --> 05:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
were going to want this information so
 
05:06:52.070 --> 05:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
they put together something that I'm
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
going to send you it's the film
 
05:06:56.330 --> 05:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
and then it's the panel discussion
 
05:06:59.448 --> 05:06:59.458 align:start position:0%
afterwards so you can see how it
 
05:07:02.090 --> 05:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
happened in Alabama so they
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
um sent me an email and said forward
 
05:07:06.890 --> 05:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
this on to your lawmakers and they have
 
05:07:08.570 --> 05:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
offered to come to New Hampshire to
 
05:07:10.850 --> 05:07:10.860 align:start position:0%
speak with any of you we tried to get a
 
05:07:12.708 --> 05:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
meeting together with Governor sununu I
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
reached out
 
05:07:15.410 --> 05:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
um with I was working with Senator
 
05:07:18.170 --> 05:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
Carson and Senator Whitley and we went
 
05:07:19.550 --> 05:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
right up to the governor's office and
 
05:07:20.930 --> 05:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
said can we meet with the governor and
 
05:07:22.490 --> 05:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
they said yeah he would love to hear
 
05:07:24.770 --> 05:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
about this but we have not been able to
 
05:07:28.190 --> 05:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
get on his schedule and Gina Ross has
 
05:07:30.770 --> 05:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
said on a dime I will jump on a plane
 
05:07:33.050 --> 05:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
and come and meet with your governor
 
05:07:35.390 --> 05:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
I talked to her yesterday and she said
 
05:07:37.310 --> 05:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
any luck with getting a meeting with the
 
05:07:38.930 --> 05:07:38.940 align:start position:0%
governor and I said not yet and she said
 
05:07:41.330 --> 05:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
Deli I have
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
um friends in the governor's office in
 
05:07:46.250 --> 05:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
Alabama that know him let me see if I
 
05:07:48.110 --> 05:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
can connect it that way
 
05:07:50.510 --> 05:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
so I just want you to know we have been
 
05:07:53.208 --> 05:07:53.218 align:start position:0%
working on this we had a committee that
 
05:07:55.490 --> 05:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
worked on this all summer long we have
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
another bill a Senate bill that's going
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
to address the workforce shortage so
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
that we can have
 
05:08:05.230 --> 05:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
qualified teachers in these programs
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
it's a different curriculum why which is
 
05:08:12.170 --> 05:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
why she highly recommended it not be
 
05:08:15.590 --> 05:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
part of the doe because children zero
 
05:08:17.208 --> 05:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
through five it's a play-based
 
05:08:18.948 --> 05:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
curriculum you've probably heard of
 
05:08:22.128 --> 05:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
Reggio Emilia or creative curriculum
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
those are all based on play and
 
05:08:27.708 --> 05:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through 12th is an academic
 
05:08:29.810 --> 05:08:29.820 align:start position:0%
curriculum so that's why we'd like to
 
05:08:32.030 --> 05:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
see it separate and not part of the doe
 
05:08:35.810 --> 05:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
and she said it is so vitally important
 
05:08:38.628 --> 05:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
to the economy of your state and the
 
05:08:40.910 --> 05:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
welfare of Children and Families that it
 
05:08:43.730 --> 05:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
deserves its own department so she's she
 
05:08:45.288 --> 05:08:45.298 align:start position:0%
said to me you fight for that department
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we did in Alabama and it is
 
05:08:49.788 --> 05:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
working for us
 
05:08:52.690 --> 05:08:52.700 align:start position:0%
so we I've also researched other states
 
05:08:56.330 --> 05:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
on average for every dollar invested in
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
early childhood Ed there's a range but
 
05:09:01.788 --> 05:09:01.798 align:start position:0%
the the lowest return is four dollars
 
05:09:03.770 --> 05:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
and the highest return for some States
 
05:09:05.410 --> 05:09:05.420 align:start position:0%
has been 16
 
05:09:08.090 --> 05:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
so there's an economist I wrote about
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
him and I'll send you that that has done
 
05:09:13.610 --> 05:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
a lot of work around this and he's done
 
05:09:16.368 --> 05:09:16.378 align:start position:0%
the research and I looked at his numbers
 
05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
and his statistics and then I also went
 
05:09:20.330 --> 05:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
and looked at other states that are
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
getting it done
 
05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
um Oklahoma five dollars and 12 cents
 
05:09:28.670 --> 05:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
for every dollar spent Tennessee I think
 
05:09:31.208 --> 05:09:31.218 align:start position:0%
was a little over four dollars Georgia
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
they're they're all seeing a return on
 
05:09:36.890 --> 05:09:36.900 align:start position:0%
their investment and kids are thriving
 
05:09:40.070 --> 05:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
we know that many kids have Aces if we
 
05:09:43.010 --> 05:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
don't want a child to go through life
 
05:09:44.990 --> 05:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
with traumatic experiences we have to
 
05:09:47.868 --> 05:09:47.878 align:start position:0%
provide positive experiences that's what
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
preschool does it provides positive of
 
05:09:53.570 --> 05:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
experiences to mitigate Aces so this is
 
05:09:55.490 --> 05:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
to me it's a no-brainer and I'm so
 
05:09:56.750 --> 05:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
frustrated that it hasn't happened
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
sooner I actually taught preschool a
 
05:10:01.490 --> 05:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
number of years ago and it's probably
 
05:10:03.530 --> 05:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
one of the most rewarding and important
 
05:10:05.810 --> 05:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
jobs I've ever done I'm I'm a nationally
 
05:10:05.820 --> 05:10:07.208 align:start position:0%
jobs I've ever done I'm I'm a nationally
award-winning

05:10:07.208 --> 05:10:07.218 align:start position:0%
award-winning
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
teacher at the middle school level but
 
05:10:12.650 --> 05:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
it was where I made the most impact I
 
05:10:14.390 --> 05:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
thought was in the preschool classroom
 
05:10:18.288 --> 05:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
so I will I will send you I I got you
 
05:10:21.288 --> 05:10:21.298 align:start position:0%
something from Alabama from the research
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
that they had done I will send you that
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
and I will give you my testimony and I'm
 
05:10:26.330 --> 05:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
05:10:29.330 --> 05:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative Simon
 
05:10:30.890 --> 05:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
and then Schmidt
 
05:10:32.208 --> 05:10:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you you
 
05:10:34.490 --> 05:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
um you referenced return on the dollar
 
05:10:37.310 --> 05:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
how was that measured
 
05:10:40.670 --> 05:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
so many states do it different ways but
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
um for example I'll tell you the um
 
05:10:47.930 --> 05:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
Alabama return on investment was through
 
05:10:51.410 --> 05:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
retention so their numbers increased of
 
05:10:54.650 --> 05:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
kids not having to be held back and I
 
05:10:57.288 --> 05:10:57.298 align:start position:0%
have the figure right here
 
05:11:03.288 --> 05:11:03.298 align:start position:0%
a 126 million dollars has been saved
 
05:11:05.030 --> 05:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
um without having to retain children
 
05:11:07.010 --> 05:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
because they started out in preschool
 
05:11:09.948 --> 05:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
and not just kindergarten so that's one
 
05:11:11.150 --> 05:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
measure but there are different
 
05:11:12.948 --> 05:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
different states different states have
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
done different measures
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
so so you may when you say one state
 
05:11:18.288 --> 05:11:18.298 align:start position:0%
sixteen dollars one you'd have to look
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
at each individual report it's not an
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
Apples to Apples comparison correct yep
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you so much you're welcome
 
05:11:24.650 --> 05:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
05:11:27.948 --> 05:11:27.958 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair uh I think I know
 
05:11:31.368 --> 05:11:31.378 align:start position:0%
what Aces means uh but maybe since this
 
05:11:34.128 --> 05:11:34.138 align:start position:0%
is not a children and you're right not
 
05:11:35.930 --> 05:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
everybody might know what I mean so but
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's not my question but I'll explain
 
05:11:42.050 --> 05:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
it after okay so could it be that uh
 
05:11:45.770 --> 05:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
that because young children are so
 
05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
different in as I was kind of alluding
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
to earlier in my other question
 
05:11:54.170 --> 05:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh so different from uh older children
 
05:11:56.930 --> 05:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
who are already more skilled in all
 
05:12:00.110 --> 05:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
virtually everything that it really is
 
05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a separate world
 
05:12:04.730 --> 05:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
05:12:06.770 --> 05:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
emotional emotional social emotional
 
05:12:08.330 --> 05:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
growth and development and that happens
 
05:12:10.788 --> 05:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
through play and kids don't even realize
 
05:12:13.610 --> 05:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
that they're learning when they play
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
um you know you can learn science in
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
social studies when you play so it's
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's a different curriculum it's
 
05:12:22.850 --> 05:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
not sitting down at a desk listening to
 
05:12:25.368 --> 05:12:25.378 align:start position:0%
a teacher teach so they're different
 
05:12:28.970 --> 05:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say that you could put this
 
05:12:31.430 --> 05:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
department under the doe and maybe
 
05:12:33.288 --> 05:12:33.298 align:start position:0%
that's what has to happen we have some
 
05:12:34.970 --> 05:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
statute that maybe we have to look at
 
05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
but there's a strong argument for them
 
05:12:40.128 --> 05:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
to be separate because the curriculum is
 
05:12:41.208 --> 05:12:41.218 align:start position:0%
so different
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
Aces okay adverse childhood experiences
 
05:12:48.288 --> 05:12:48.298 align:start position:0%
so do we have time for this because I'd
 
05:12:50.510 --> 05:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
love to okay so let me just tell you
 
05:12:53.930 --> 05:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
there was a study done years ago on why
 
05:12:56.448 --> 05:12:56.458 align:start position:0%
people who were losing weight
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
um were gaining it back so the doctor
 
05:13:00.770 --> 05:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
met with a number of obese people and
 
05:13:03.530 --> 05:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
said tell me about your childhoods and
 
05:13:05.330 --> 05:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
this is disturbing but one of the
 
05:13:07.310 --> 05:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
questions he asked was when was your
 
05:13:08.930 --> 05:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
first sexual experience
 
05:13:13.128 --> 05:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
and they were answering three four six
 
05:13:13.138 --> 05:13:14.390 align:start position:0%
and they were answering three four six
seven

05:13:14.390 --> 05:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
seven
 
05:13:17.628 --> 05:13:17.638 align:start position:0%
and he said oh my God this is this is
 
05:13:20.270 --> 05:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
awful so he developed this study and
 
05:13:23.390 --> 05:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
it's called the aces study and there are
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
10 there are more than 10 but 10 on
 
05:13:29.090 --> 05:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
average adverse childhood experiences
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
that we measure in children and we say
 
05:13:34.070 --> 05:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
if a child has four or more of those
 
05:13:37.970 --> 05:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
then they're considered traumatized so a
 
05:13:39.650 --> 05:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
positive childhood experience can
 
05:13:42.350 --> 05:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
mitigate that or lessen that there are
 
05:13:45.410 --> 05:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of articles online
 
05:13:48.128 --> 05:13:48.138 align:start position:0%
about the aces study it's fascinating
 
05:13:51.650 --> 05:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
check it out I would highly recommend
 
05:13:53.570 --> 05:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
that you learn more about Aces it's the
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
like the public health problem they're
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
saying of the century you know that
 
05:14:01.910 --> 05:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're not addressing trauma in children
 
05:14:04.490 --> 05:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
05:14:06.530 --> 05:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:14:07.850 --> 05:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:18.288 --> 05:14:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:20.448 --> 05:14:20.458 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
05:14:22.490 --> 05:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Teresa Rosenberger I
 
05:14:24.410 --> 05:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
work for the law firm of Bernstein Shore
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today
 
05:14:30.430 --> 05:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
I'm an informational point of view only
 
05:14:33.948 --> 05:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
representing Waterford upstart Waterford
 
05:14:36.890 --> 05:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
upstart is a
 
05:14:36.900 --> 05:14:38.770 align:start position:0%
upstart is a
um

05:14:38.770 --> 05:14:38.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten Readiness program that
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
started in 2009 in Utah
 
05:14:46.970 --> 05:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
and the it was started as a pilot
 
05:14:46.980 --> 05:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
and the it was started as a pilot
program

05:14:47.990 --> 05:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
it is now in over 30 state it has been
 
05:14:54.650 --> 05:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire since 2020 they started
 
05:14:57.890 --> 05:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
as a pilot program down in Nashua and
 
05:15:00.050 --> 05:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
working with the city of Nashua and
 
05:15:04.010 --> 05:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
United Way what it is
 
05:15:06.430 --> 05:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm talking too loud
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
what it is it's a program where a
 
05:15:12.910 --> 05:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
three-year-old four-year-old
 
05:15:15.830 --> 05:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten child signs up with the
 
05:15:19.448 --> 05:15:19.458 align:start position:0%
parents they receive a computer
 
05:15:22.490 --> 05:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
they receive internet connection if they
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
don't have it and they are given a
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
software program where it's 15 to 20
 
05:15:30.708 --> 05:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
minutes a day five days a week that the
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
child has owned this program they're
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
also given a coach uh the coaches is
 
05:15:39.890 --> 05:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
when I say not present it's not
 
05:15:41.690 --> 05:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
necessarily somebody down the street
 
05:15:44.890 --> 05:15:44.900 align:start position:0%
they're giving a coach the program
 
05:15:47.448 --> 05:15:47.458 align:start position:0%
assesses the child before the program
 
05:15:49.368 --> 05:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
and the program assesses the child
 
05:15:52.970 --> 05:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
afterwards uh there is a summer program
 
05:15:56.810 --> 05:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
and there's also a school year school
 
05:15:58.850 --> 05:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
year program the one that started
 
05:16:03.550 --> 05:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
initially in Nashua had almost 100 kids
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
and it was basically the summer program
 
05:16:09.770 --> 05:16:09.780 align:start position:0%
and the outcomes were tremendous and
 
05:16:11.448 --> 05:16:11.458 align:start position:0%
they really they really these kids
 
05:16:13.330 --> 05:16:13.340 align:start position:0%
really did a great job
 
05:16:15.948 --> 05:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
learning and they can what's interesting
 
05:16:20.090 --> 05:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
about it to me is that the coach can
 
05:16:23.330 --> 05:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
watch the program how the child's using
 
05:16:26.150 --> 05:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
it during the entire process so the
 
05:16:28.368 --> 05:16:28.378 align:start position:0%
coach Can See For example oh gosh this
 
05:16:31.250 --> 05:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
child's using this program 45 minutes a
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
day or an hour a day or the child's
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
using in a weekend which they're not
 
05:16:36.288 --> 05:16:36.298 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing it's supposed to be
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
15 minutes and five days a week and so
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
then the coach is going to call up and
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
say just curious what's going on what's
 
05:16:48.050 --> 05:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
been really interesting in a couple of
 
05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
cases what they found is the parent
 
05:16:53.868 --> 05:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
using the program because a parent stops
 
05:16:57.470 --> 05:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
school at eighth grade and the parent
 
05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
has found that the program actually is
 
05:17:02.030 --> 05:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
really terrific it's Math Science and
 
05:17:04.128 --> 05:17:04.138 align:start position:0%
reading concentrating mainly on reading
 
05:17:06.410 --> 05:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
for um
 
05:17:10.970 --> 05:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
new Americans or Americans who who
 
05:17:13.128 --> 05:17:13.138 align:start position:0%
English isn't the first language it's
 
05:17:15.410 --> 05:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
been tremendous for the kids but also
 
05:17:18.590 --> 05:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
the parents the parents as well there
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
are supplements to the program that you
 
05:17:22.490 --> 05:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
can bring in for other kids if they
 
05:17:24.410 --> 05:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
really want to work on math and science
 
05:17:27.890 --> 05:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
so that started in 2020 and I will say
 
05:17:31.250 --> 05:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
the outcomes in Nashville were
 
05:17:34.070 --> 05:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous 93 percent of the children
 
05:17:37.810 --> 05:17:37.820 align:start position:0%
who took the program were had
 
05:17:40.610 --> 05:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
kindergarten Readiness at the advanced
 
05:17:44.270 --> 05:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
level which is tremendous and so it's
 
05:17:45.650 --> 05:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
work it's working across the country
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
it's working here in 2022
 
05:17:53.570 --> 05:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
um the the state applied for arpa funds
 
05:17:57.410 --> 05:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
and the program received are per fund
 
05:18:00.410 --> 05:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
um to take the program Statewide it is
 
05:18:03.850 --> 05:18:03.860 align:start position:0%
now in its first year of the entire year
 
05:18:07.730 --> 05:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
we now have almost 5 500 kids in the
 
05:18:10.250 --> 05:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
program a little less than that
 
05:18:13.550 --> 05:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
it'll go through the end of the school
 
05:18:15.530 --> 05:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
year it'll be really interesting to see
 
05:18:17.810 --> 05:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
what the results are then and then
 
05:18:21.650 --> 05:18:21.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll do summer summer again
 
05:18:24.770 --> 05:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to let you also know that in
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
doing this we've done it totally in
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
cooperation with doe they have been a
 
05:18:33.110 --> 05:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
fabulous partner they have helped us
 
05:18:35.570 --> 05:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
recruit the biggest issue we have is
 
05:18:38.090 --> 05:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
recruiting Because you need to get to
 
05:18:40.910 --> 05:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
those families and have children who are
 
05:18:43.490 --> 05:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
three or four and getting ready to go go
 
05:18:47.330 --> 05:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
to to school so doe has been tremendous
 
05:18:49.850 --> 05:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
in helping us with recruiting
 
05:18:52.610 --> 05:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
introducing us all the resources we need
 
05:18:54.590 --> 05:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
to be out there working we actually have
 
05:18:56.990 --> 05:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
a lady in New Hampshire that's on the
 
05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
ground recruiting these kits
 
05:19:02.570 --> 05:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
um do even doe even this summer brought
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
in HHS and we had a great meeting with
 
05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
HHS because if you think about it when
 
05:19:11.208 --> 05:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
they're looking at housing for lower
 
05:19:15.050 --> 05:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
income or they're looking at at Early
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
Childhood issues medical issues ETC they
 
05:19:20.150 --> 05:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
know where the families are they're in
 
05:19:22.490 --> 05:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
touch and so they've been they've been
 
05:19:24.410 --> 05:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
tremendous it's been great working with
 
05:19:26.030 --> 05:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
them I will say
 
05:19:31.128 --> 05:19:31.138 align:start position:0%
um doe I I am impressed I say this maybe
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't say it but I am impressed
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
they aren't working in a silo and I
 
05:19:37.250 --> 05:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
think that's unfortunately what we see
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
too often in government You've Got The
 
05:19:41.390 --> 05:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
Silo here here and here but they are
 
05:19:44.810 --> 05:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
really they really are trying to work in
 
05:19:47.690 --> 05:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
the bigger perspective and um and have
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
recruitment uh as far as
 
05:19:51.120 --> 05:19:52.368 align:start position:0%
recruitment uh as far as
um

05:19:52.368 --> 05:19:52.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:53.930 --> 05:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
I mean I've talked to you about the
 
05:19:55.128 --> 05:19:55.138 align:start position:0%
outcomes I think to me that's
 
05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
interesting right now you're seeing a
 
05:19:58.368 --> 05:19:58.378 align:start position:0%
number of Ukrainian children sign up for
 
05:19:59.330 --> 05:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
the program
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm here to answer any questions it's
 
05:20:04.128 --> 05:20:04.138 align:start position:0%
been successful we're hoping New
 
05:20:06.410 --> 05:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can continue
 
05:20:08.990 --> 05:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
um our grant over this summer but we may
 
05:20:14.090 --> 05:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
be able to extend it uh and so far we
 
05:20:16.368 --> 05:20:16.378 align:start position:0%
also have asked for responses from the
 
05:20:17.990 --> 05:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
parents or responses from the parents
 
05:20:20.530 --> 05:20:20.540 align:start position:0%
have been tremendous
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
05:20:25.730 --> 05:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
represent villain
 
05:20:27.948 --> 05:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
05:20:31.970 --> 05:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
it's great we're doing with preschool
 
05:20:35.090 --> 05:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
but it's my contention and observation
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
that part of the issue is parenting yes
 
05:20:42.288 --> 05:20:42.298 align:start position:0%
we don't teach parents how to parent
 
05:20:44.288 --> 05:20:44.298 align:start position:0%
as opposed to teaching
 
05:20:46.910 --> 05:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
preschoolers how to be a preschooler and
 
05:20:49.610 --> 05:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
and how to play and so forth is there
 
05:20:53.208 --> 05:20:53.218 align:start position:0%
any part of this program that extends to
 
05:20:55.850 --> 05:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
parents to say this is how you be a good
 
05:20:58.430 --> 05:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
parent this is how you encourage your
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
kids to do what they should be doing yes
 
05:21:02.448 --> 05:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Dolan you
 
05:21:04.310 --> 05:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
helped me out because I can tell you I
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
can't always read too well what I've
 
05:21:08.390 --> 05:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
scribbled and the part I forgot is the
 
05:21:10.368 --> 05:21:10.378 align:start position:0%
parenting part the program works
 
05:21:12.110 --> 05:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
tremendously with the parents and the
 
05:21:15.170 --> 05:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
whole point is at doing it at home and
 
05:21:18.050 --> 05:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
not doing it at a Learning Center or
 
05:21:20.208 --> 05:21:20.218 align:start position:0%
doing in a school is it has to have
 
05:21:22.070 --> 05:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
involvement with a parent and the parent
 
05:21:23.690 --> 05:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
has to help with turning on the computer
 
05:21:25.550 --> 05:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
the parent has to help with getting the
 
05:21:28.850 --> 05:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
program there so the entire focus on
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
this is trying to get parental
 
05:21:32.270 --> 05:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
involvement when these children are
 
05:21:34.670 --> 05:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
three and four and as they've done this
 
05:21:37.010 --> 05:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
over the country it looks like that
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
really is paying paying off we're new
 
05:21:40.670 --> 05:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but in other
 
05:21:43.010 --> 05:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
places but that's one of the tenants of
 
05:21:44.810 --> 05:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
it is getting parental involvement and
 
05:21:46.368 --> 05:21:46.378 align:start position:0%
thank you so much because I forgot that
 
05:21:46.378 --> 05:21:49.788 align:start position:0%
thank you so much because I forgot that
part

05:21:49.788 --> 05:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:53.090 --> 05:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you we heard earlier that the plan
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the pre-k program was play-based
 
05:21:57.470 --> 05:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
education but it from what you're
 
05:21:59.570 --> 05:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
describing it sounds a lot more
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
academic which seems I question whether
 
05:22:04.368 --> 05:22:04.378 align:start position:0%
that's appropriate in that age group but
 
05:22:08.090 --> 05:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
well you know I have three children and
 
05:22:10.368 --> 05:22:10.378 align:start position:0%
I was probably not a really nice parent
 
05:22:12.530 --> 05:22:12.540 align:start position:0%
and that they were only allowed when
 
05:22:15.050 --> 05:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
they were young 30 minutes of TV a day
 
05:22:16.850 --> 05:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
and it couldn't be each one they had to
 
05:22:18.948 --> 05:22:18.958 align:start position:0%
agree on the program so you can imagine
 
05:22:22.610 --> 05:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
what it was it was PBS and way back when
 
05:22:25.250 --> 05:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
my children are now in their 30s and 40s
 
05:22:28.690 --> 05:22:28.700 align:start position:0%
when going to school the PBS programming
 
05:22:31.368 --> 05:22:31.378 align:start position:0%
there was the science program there was
 
05:22:33.288 --> 05:22:33.298 align:start position:0%
the one two three I forgot what it was
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
all called but the PBS program it was
 
05:22:39.050 --> 05:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
really geared at those kids but geared
 
05:22:41.330 --> 05:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
is to learning through
 
05:22:41.340 --> 05:22:42.730 align:start position:0%
is to learning through
um

05:22:42.730 --> 05:22:42.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say learning through
 
05:22:46.850 --> 05:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
play because you can't play on TV but it
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
was fun it wasn't like that this that's
 
05:22:51.230 --> 05:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what this program's like and I'd
 
05:22:53.690 --> 05:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
be more than happy if you like to come
 
05:22:55.788 --> 05:22:55.798 align:start position:0%
in at some point and um bring your
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
computer and let you all see the the 15
 
05:22:57.718 --> 05:22:59.570 align:start position:0%
computer and let you all see the the 15
minutes

05:22:59.570 --> 05:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
I hate to say it's PBS based it's not
 
05:23:05.690 --> 05:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
but it's it's more what's inspired more
 
05:23:08.150 --> 05:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's more fun learning for kids so
 
05:23:09.470 --> 05:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to have you're going to
 
05:23:11.810 --> 05:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
have a cat bouncing around like this and
 
05:23:13.788 --> 05:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to count thank you yeah
 
05:23:15.170 --> 05:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
okay you're welcome other questions
 
05:23:17.150 --> 05:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
05:23:19.550 --> 05:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
you said you weren't speaking in support
 
05:23:22.610 --> 05:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
of our or against the bill my question
 
05:23:24.590 --> 05:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
to you is would the program you're
 
05:23:27.050 --> 05:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
working on be harmed in any way if a
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
department of early childhood education
 
05:23:31.368 --> 05:23:31.378 align:start position:0%
was established I don't think so because
 
05:23:33.490 --> 05:23:33.500 align:start position:0%
when I looked at this this is
 
05:23:35.990 --> 05:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
multifaceted and multi-based and it's
 
05:23:39.410 --> 05:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
everything from in the home so no I
 
05:23:40.788 --> 05:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
don't think so hopefully we can
 
05:23:42.110 --> 05:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
integrate in it and the only reason
 
05:23:43.550 --> 05:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
we're not taking a position we're
 
05:23:45.970 --> 05:23:45.980 align:start position:0%
totally in support of
 
05:23:49.010 --> 05:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
kindergarten Readiness but as to where
 
05:23:51.110 --> 05:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
you put it I mean from my perspective
 
05:23:53.090 --> 05:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
frankly I like it in places that aren't
 
05:23:55.850 --> 05:23:55.860 align:start position:0%
going to Silo and so I think doe has
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
been doing a great job and with the
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration with DHHS but we really
 
05:24:02.570 --> 05:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
are here advocating for Readiness
 
05:24:04.490 --> 05:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
programs for children but I think such
 
05:24:06.590 --> 05:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
as multi it's with multi we would we'd
 
05:24:08.930 --> 05:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
be fine I think okay
 
05:24:10.490 --> 05:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
05:24:15.230 --> 05:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:24:18.530 --> 05:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 620.
 
05:24:18.540 --> 05:24:27.230 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 620.
yes

05:24:27.230 --> 05:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone I'm Christine
 
05:24:30.288 --> 05:24:30.298 align:start position:0%
Brennan Deputy Commissioner from the
 
05:24:33.050 --> 05:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I also serve as
 
05:24:35.330 --> 05:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
co-counsel with Trish Tilly from the
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:24:40.010 --> 05:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
on our Council for thriving children I'm
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
a long time educator for over 40 decades
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
and served under Mary Heath who was an
 
05:24:47.150 --> 05:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely passionate person about
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
education it's wonderful to be
 
05:24:51.708 --> 05:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
collaborating with her again I guess
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
what I want to talk about with this bill
 
05:24:56.030 --> 05:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
is really give you a little bit of
 
05:24:58.850 --> 05:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
context in education around what we've
 
05:25:00.708 --> 05:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
been doing to try to really break down
 
05:25:02.690 --> 05:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
the silos with the Department of Health
 
05:25:06.170 --> 05:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
and Human Services really look at what
 
05:25:07.550 --> 05:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
are some of the duplicative services
 
05:25:09.890 --> 05:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
that we have that that agency is doing
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
and that what we're doing around
 
05:25:14.090 --> 05:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
professional development and really
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the gaps because the
 
05:25:18.550 --> 05:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:25:20.930 --> 05:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
and I've been studying this for a long
 
05:25:23.690 --> 05:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
time so there is lots of confusion they
 
05:25:25.550 --> 05:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
have the children I almost think of as
 
05:25:25.560 --> 05:25:27.110 align:start position:0%
have the children I almost think of as
infant

05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
infant
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
um they have an infant until they are
 
05:25:31.368 --> 05:25:31.378 align:start position:0%
five years old and so then they
 
05:25:34.190 --> 05:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
transition them to our agency the
 
05:25:36.170 --> 05:25:36.180 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and so that
 
05:25:39.770 --> 05:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
transition time is really something that
 
05:25:41.930 --> 05:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
needs lots of lots of improvement and
 
05:25:43.550 --> 05:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's really with this preschool
 
05:25:46.368 --> 05:25:46.378 align:start position:0%
development Grant we've been looking at
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
what would be the best way to organize
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
early childhood education and there were
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
four options that we've been studying
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
and so I'm going to kind of look at this
 
05:25:58.970 --> 05:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
bill in two ways first where the office
 
05:26:01.910 --> 05:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
should sit there is under the governor's
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
office there there's right now the way
 
05:26:06.590 --> 05:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're doing it operating it separately
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
and having memorandums of understanding
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
there's it could be under Department of
 
05:26:12.948 --> 05:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services or it could be
 
05:26:16.550 --> 05:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
under Department of Education there are
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
um two there there's lots of pots of
 
05:26:22.490 --> 05:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
money that help us you know serve our
 
05:26:24.890 --> 05:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
Littles around the state two of them
 
05:26:27.530 --> 05:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
being one um there's two big ones it's
 
05:26:30.170 --> 05:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
our ccdf fund that's at the Department
 
05:26:32.628 --> 05:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and then we
 
05:26:36.190 --> 05:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
have our idea Part B that serves
 
05:26:39.170 --> 05:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
preschool special education students
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
those are the two largest pots of
 
05:26:45.830 --> 05:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
funding and our Ida funding cannot be
 
05:26:47.930 --> 05:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
anywhere else except for under the
 
05:26:49.368 --> 05:26:49.378 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and humans I mean
 
05:26:52.250 --> 05:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
under us we can't move that around it
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
has to stay under us I will this came
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
hot off the press this really is a great
 
05:27:00.530 --> 05:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
document and it's called integrated
 
05:27:02.510 --> 05:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
efficient early care and education
 
05:27:02.520 --> 05:27:03.368 align:start position:0%
efficient early care and education
system

05:27:03.368 --> 05:27:03.378 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:27:06.410 --> 05:27:06.420 align:start position:0%
and it lays out how all of the other
 
05:27:08.930 --> 05:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
states have been organizing themselves
 
05:27:12.830 --> 05:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
around early childhood and right now 25
 
05:27:15.070 --> 05:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
states have it under the Department of
 
05:27:17.810 --> 05:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
Education and so I'll be sure to send
 
05:27:19.490 --> 05:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
you this document
 
05:27:19.500 --> 05:27:20.208 align:start position:0%
you this document
um

05:27:20.208 --> 05:27:20.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:21.890 --> 05:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
so that is about the office of early
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
childhood and then when we look at the
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
pilot which is ABS like right now we are
 
05:27:28.970 --> 05:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
we learn through covid that looking at
 
05:27:32.570 --> 05:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
how we serve our youngest children is
 
05:27:34.970 --> 05:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential how we build their
 
05:27:37.128 --> 05:27:37.138 align:start position:0%
Foundation I think the time is right to
 
05:27:38.390 --> 05:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
think about how we could do it
 
05:27:41.510 --> 05:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
differently we are already through our
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
preschool development Grant looking at a
 
05:27:47.930 --> 05:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
pilot and this pilot is starting now
 
05:27:50.208 --> 05:27:50.218 align:start position:0%
we're getting a task force together and
 
05:27:51.650 --> 05:27:51.660 align:start position:0%
we're hoping it's not going to be a
 
05:27:53.868 --> 05:27:53.878 align:start position:0%
three-year study right now we have we'll
 
05:27:56.030 --> 05:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
be doing it for a year and this is under
 
05:27:57.170 --> 05:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
05:28:01.070 --> 05:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
Services funding under the ccdf and our
 
05:28:03.708 --> 05:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
hope is that we are going to gain input
 
05:28:06.948 --> 05:28:06.958 align:start position:0%
from leaders we are going to be having a
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
final report we'll be defining some of
 
05:28:10.970 --> 05:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
the policies looking at some of the
 
05:28:12.470 --> 05:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
potential costs
 
05:28:14.390 --> 05:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
um considerations and this should be
 
05:28:17.230 --> 05:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
over and finished in by September 30th
 
05:28:17.240 --> 05:28:18.910 align:start position:0%
over and finished in by September 30th
2023

05:28:18.910 --> 05:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
2023
 
05:28:21.830 --> 05:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that I am so impressed
 
05:28:24.170 --> 05:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
with all of these kind of questions that
 
05:28:26.570 --> 05:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
you've been asking because I can tell
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
that you are
 
05:28:31.970 --> 05:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
um understanding the importance of our
 
05:28:33.590 --> 05:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
early years and the Brain development
 
05:28:36.350 --> 05:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
that happens the servant return and how
 
05:28:38.330 --> 05:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
crucial it is to making sure that
 
05:28:40.070 --> 05:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
children are not only successful in the
 
05:28:43.730 --> 05:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
younger years but it continues on
 
05:28:45.890 --> 05:28:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any guests
 
05:28:47.930 --> 05:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
representative Gould thank you madam
 
05:28:49.730 --> 05:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for coming in and
 
05:28:51.470 --> 05:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
testifying my question is you talked
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
about this already work workers and
 
05:28:57.288 --> 05:28:57.298 align:start position:0%
funding in two different departments
 
05:28:58.788 --> 05:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and Department
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
of Education are there also workers that
 
05:29:03.410 --> 05:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
would mitigate to this or migrate to
 
05:29:06.170 --> 05:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
this new department so in terms of
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
adding more employees I've looked in the
 
05:29:10.430 --> 05:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill we'd have a commissioner and then
 
05:29:12.350 --> 05:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
we'd have them they could set up
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
departments do you see people already
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
doing these tasks that could move into I
 
05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
think that that we part of once the
 
05:29:21.650 --> 05:29:21.660 align:start position:0%
office has decided where it will sit we
 
05:29:23.090 --> 05:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
will have to look at what the what
 
05:29:23.100 --> 05:29:24.430 align:start position:0%
will have to look at what the what
functions

05:29:24.430 --> 05:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
functions
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
this office will serve and where they'll
 
05:29:28.910 --> 05:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
be sitting so I do imagine that there
 
05:29:30.890 --> 05:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
would be a lot of Shifting around of
 
05:29:34.368 --> 05:29:34.378 align:start position:0%
positions and I think that it's not my
 
05:29:35.930 --> 05:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
office so I don't want to speak for the
 
05:29:37.010 --> 05:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:29:39.410 --> 05:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
but their funding is tied to you know
 
05:29:44.090 --> 05:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:46.550 --> 05:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
other questions working on assignment
 
05:29:48.350 --> 05:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:29:50.150 --> 05:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
um as I'm listening to testimony today
 
05:29:51.770 --> 05:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to
 
05:29:53.868 --> 05:29:53.878 align:start position:0%
kind of reconcile a couple of pieces of
 
05:29:56.628 --> 05:29:56.638 align:start position:0%
data that seem to Conflict for me and
 
05:29:57.890 --> 05:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
being from the Department hopefully you
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
can help me out with that a little bit
 
05:30:00.830 --> 05:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
but I've heard that all but Six States
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
have implemented implemented this kind
 
05:30:03.830 --> 05:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
of program
 
05:30:05.750 --> 05:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
but I also constantly hear that New
 
05:30:07.190 --> 05:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has the third highest
 
05:30:09.650 --> 05:30:09.660 align:start position:0%
education system public education system
 
05:30:11.390 --> 05:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
um and so if the argument is that we
 
05:30:13.910 --> 05:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
need to implement this to have better
 
05:30:16.850 --> 05:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
outcomes how how is how do we reconcile
 
05:30:19.730 --> 05:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
those two things and also the two states
 
05:30:21.708 --> 05:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
that are supposedly better than us do
 
05:30:23.150 --> 05:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
they have these programs or do they not
 
05:30:25.610 --> 05:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
have these programs so I think there's I
 
05:30:28.610 --> 05:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
think some of the discrepancies that you
 
05:30:30.830 --> 05:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
hear is is depends on what criterias
 
05:30:32.690 --> 05:30:32.700 align:start position:0%
that we're using to measure and so
 
05:30:34.070 --> 05:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's where some of the confusion
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
happens because I think we are when we
 
05:30:40.190 --> 05:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
look at the state how we how we educate
 
05:30:42.890 --> 05:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
our kids we do pretty well and I think
 
05:30:46.788 --> 05:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
we fail on some of the research because
 
05:30:49.970 --> 05:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
we don't have state funded pre-k and one
 
05:30:51.650 --> 05:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
of the things about this mixed delivery
 
05:30:53.208 --> 05:30:53.218 align:start position:0%
system that I think is important for all
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
of us to know is it's a mixed delivery
 
05:30:56.990 --> 05:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
system that we're looking to study
 
05:31:01.128 --> 05:31:01.138 align:start position:0%
saying it's very very broad is what what
 
05:31:03.530 --> 05:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
is it that families want that are going
 
05:31:05.570 --> 05:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
to have access that fits their
 
05:31:09.230 --> 05:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
individual child and Family's needs and
 
05:31:11.628 --> 05:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking to study so it
 
05:31:14.270 --> 05:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
could be a home-based um
 
05:31:17.090 --> 05:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
program it could be a child license
 
05:31:19.730 --> 05:31:19.740 align:start position:0%
program it could be an in-school and so
 
05:31:22.368 --> 05:31:22.378 align:start position:0%
part of this task force is to look at
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
which which
 
05:31:24.718 --> 05:31:25.368 align:start position:0%
which which
um

05:31:25.368 --> 05:31:25.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:27.170 --> 05:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
you know which Best Suits the family
 
05:31:29.270 --> 05:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
needs and then what's the best child
 
05:31:33.770 --> 05:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
outcomes and our IDE Part B
 
05:31:36.050 --> 05:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
has a program that looks at child
 
05:31:38.208 --> 05:31:38.218 align:start position:0%
outcomes for special needs students
 
05:31:39.770 --> 05:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
already set up
 
05:31:41.868 --> 05:31:41.878 align:start position:0%
where Department of Health and Human
 
05:31:46.368 --> 05:31:46.378 align:start position:0%
Services they have a qris system that I
 
05:31:48.170 --> 05:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
don't think it measures any of the
 
05:31:50.690 --> 05:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
schooling or preschool or academics
 
05:31:53.990 --> 05:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
portion of preschool
 
05:31:55.490 --> 05:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:31:56.930 --> 05:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:31:57.890 --> 05:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that answer I
 
05:31:59.868 --> 05:31:59.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um my other question is
 
05:32:01.128 --> 05:32:01.138 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at other programs
 
05:32:02.750 --> 05:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
that have been implemented around the
 
05:32:06.110 --> 05:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
country have any of those states that
 
05:32:07.128 --> 05:32:07.138 align:start position:0%
you're aware of started having
 
05:32:08.510 --> 05:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
conversations about making this
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
compulsory one concern that I have is
 
05:32:12.250 --> 05:32:12.260 align:start position:0%
that if you have a state-run program
 
05:32:14.330 --> 05:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
state-run education programs tend to
 
05:32:16.250 --> 05:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
become compulsory over time and then we
 
05:32:18.530 --> 05:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
would be talking about having you know
 
05:32:20.990 --> 05:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
two Euros in a compulsory program away
 
05:32:23.090 --> 05:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
from their families so I don't think
 
05:32:24.530 --> 05:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
that they use a little compulsory but
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
it's called Universal preschool I mean
 
05:32:29.448 --> 05:32:29.458 align:start position:0%
there's always there's there's always
 
05:32:29.458 --> 05:32:29.990 align:start position:0%
there's always there's there's always
um

05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:31.910 --> 05:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it depends on there are
 
05:32:33.410 --> 05:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
states that I think have it I'd have to
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
research I want to get some let me it's
 
05:32:35.280 --> 05:32:35.930 align:start position:0%
research I want to get some let me it's
it's

05:32:35.930 --> 05:32:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:32:37.610 --> 05:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
um it's more the judicial term when you
 
05:32:39.230 --> 05:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
look at Supreme Court law around these
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of cases typically when they find
 
05:32:42.770 --> 05:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
it um they describe it as being
 
05:32:44.090 --> 05:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
compulsory in other words the parent
 
05:32:46.128 --> 05:32:46.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a choice okay the state is
 
05:32:49.128 --> 05:32:49.138 align:start position:0%
requiring that they Implement uh put
 
05:32:50.448 --> 05:32:50.458 align:start position:0%
their child into one of these programs
 
05:32:52.490 --> 05:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
so yeah I don't think that that's what
 
05:32:54.770 --> 05:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do here with this mixed
 
05:32:56.208 --> 05:32:56.218 align:start position:0%
delivery service I think that we know
 
05:32:57.410 --> 05:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is unique and
 
05:32:59.750 --> 05:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
different and that the state has
 
05:33:01.970 --> 05:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
different parts that that need different
 
05:33:04.910 --> 05:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of services I think um we know
 
05:33:06.530 --> 05:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
what we're learning with our education
 
05:33:09.170 --> 05:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
system too is that kids are unique and
 
05:33:11.090 --> 05:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
different and need different Pathways to
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
be successful in school and I think that
 
05:33:15.530 --> 05:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's what we're hoping to have here
 
05:33:18.288 --> 05:33:18.298 align:start position:0%
with our preschool kiddos thank you so
 
05:33:18.298 --> 05:33:19.368 align:start position:0%
with our preschool kiddos thank you so
much

05:33:19.368 --> 05:33:19.378 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:33:22.788 --> 05:33:22.798 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Schmidt
 
05:33:26.868 --> 05:33:26.878 align:start position:0%
so what are the five or six other states
 
05:33:29.930 --> 05:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
that we've heard do not yet have
 
05:33:32.270 --> 05:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
one of these programs I will have to get
 
05:33:34.610 --> 05:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
back to you on who they are
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have that information do
 
05:33:38.750 --> 05:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
you know that Mary
 
05:33:40.730 --> 05:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
I know the New Hampshire but we I know
 
05:33:41.810 --> 05:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's New Hampshire is one of them I
 
05:33:43.250 --> 05:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
thought we were all the other five were
 
05:33:48.590 --> 05:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
what's that any other questions I have a
 
05:33:53.930 --> 05:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
question you say you're already starting
 
05:33:56.570 --> 05:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
a pilot program how is that different
 
05:33:58.910 --> 05:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
from the pilot program specified in this
 
05:34:01.310 --> 05:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill I think what what's different a
 
05:34:03.650 --> 05:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
little bit is that theirs is a lot much
 
05:34:06.830 --> 05:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
longer ours is only a year study
 
05:34:09.170 --> 05:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
um and there's is much longer and I
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
think that the 10 match is different
 
05:34:13.970 --> 05:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
that that what we're looking for because
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
I think it would be hard for let's say
 
05:34:18.590 --> 05:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
we were looking at um
 
05:34:21.110 --> 05:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh church-based programs for them to get
 
05:34:22.610 --> 05:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
the 10 it would be a little bit
 
05:34:24.650 --> 05:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
different and they have some of the
 
05:34:27.288 --> 05:34:27.298 align:start position:0%
national ner
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
um standards that are in there that may
 
05:34:33.830 --> 05:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
could I not being familiar with all
 
05:34:38.510 --> 05:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
those things could I interpret your
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
response to be not much different except
 
05:34:45.050 --> 05:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
for the extended spam yes okay thank you
 
05:34:45.060 --> 05:34:46.310 align:start position:0%
for the extended spam yes okay thank you
that's

05:34:46.310 --> 05:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:34:48.110 --> 05:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that was my
 
05:34:50.330 --> 05:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
understanding was correct anyone else
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
then chip and I just mentioned that it's
 
05:34:56.090 --> 05:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
our intent too it's okay please come up
 
05:34:59.810 --> 05:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
and and speak on this one
 
05:35:02.330 --> 05:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
this is great
 
05:35:04.250 --> 05:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
we've known each other since she was a
 
05:35:06.350 --> 05:35:06.360 align:start position:0%
little baby practically
 
05:35:09.708 --> 05:35:09.718 align:start position:0%
um it's our intent to build off the
 
05:35:11.628 --> 05:35:11.638 align:start position:0%
learning that takes place in that pilot
 
05:35:14.390 --> 05:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
that um commissioner Brennan a Deputy
 
05:35:15.650 --> 05:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Brandon just talked about
 
05:35:19.128 --> 05:35:19.138 align:start position:0%
thank you that makes it a little clearer
 
05:35:22.128 --> 05:35:22.138 align:start position:0%
it's okay representative Simon thank you
 
05:35:23.448 --> 05:35:23.458 align:start position:0%
again Madam chair sorry that just
 
05:35:24.650 --> 05:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
sparked another question for me that
 
05:35:25.910 --> 05:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of related to the one that I
 
05:35:28.010 --> 05:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
had before if we go ahead with this
 
05:35:30.708 --> 05:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
pilot program and we start studying what
 
05:35:31.850 --> 05:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
it would mean for the State of New
 
05:35:33.890 --> 05:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then we decide hey this is
 
05:35:35.690 --> 05:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
a great idea so we want to implement it
 
05:35:37.070 --> 05:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's going to require
 
05:35:39.830 --> 05:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds in order to implement but
 
05:35:41.570 --> 05:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
I would assume at the same time you have
 
05:35:43.368 --> 05:35:43.378 align:start position:0%
no intention of making compulsory which
 
05:35:44.810 --> 05:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
means some students will be in it and
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
some students won't be in it but I
 
05:35:49.788 --> 05:35:49.798 align:start position:0%
assume we would still be charging all
 
05:35:52.368 --> 05:35:52.378 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for the program
 
05:35:52.378 --> 05:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for the program
um

05:35:53.510 --> 05:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
has has the department or anybody given
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
any thought to revenue streams for this
 
05:36:00.230 --> 05:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
is it just going to be through
 
05:36:01.610 --> 05:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
um taxpayer funding if we end up going
 
05:36:03.350 --> 05:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
in this direction so my understanding
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
and again I'm not the Department of
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services but this is
 
05:36:08.690 --> 05:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
under the C that this pilot is under the
 
05:36:12.230 --> 05:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
ccdf funding which is federal funding
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
um just do this study and that's
 
05:36:17.448 --> 05:36:17.458 align:start position:0%
allowable under under that fund
 
05:36:19.368 --> 05:36:19.378 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up yes but the federal
 
05:36:21.350 --> 05:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
funding will cover the expense of the
 
05:36:23.868 --> 05:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
study itself but we're doing the study I
 
05:36:26.270 --> 05:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
would assume to get to a result right to
 
05:36:28.128 --> 05:36:28.138 align:start position:0%
get to a final report to get to a report
 
05:36:30.170 --> 05:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
and that report would then be to
 
05:36:31.850 --> 05:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
recommend either mixing the program
 
05:36:34.510 --> 05:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't it's not effective or
 
05:36:36.830 --> 05:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
expanding the program and if we expand
 
05:36:37.970 --> 05:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
the program once again if it's not
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
compulsory it's not covering all
 
05:36:41.448 --> 05:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
students but so what is the what is the
 
05:36:42.470 --> 05:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
potential have we given thought to
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
revenue stream yeah so thank you for
 
05:36:45.410 --> 05:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
this question because I think it will
 
05:36:47.690 --> 05:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
help clarify I don't think that any of
 
05:36:50.208 --> 05:36:50.218 align:start position:0%
those perimeters are established and
 
05:36:52.128 --> 05:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
that's what this task force is is going
 
05:36:53.270 --> 05:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
to be doing
 
05:36:56.510 --> 05:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
um looking at trying to look at what we
 
05:36:58.368 --> 05:36:58.378 align:start position:0%
will be studying what what is the long
 
05:36:58.378 --> 05:36:59.750 align:start position:0%
will be studying what what is the long
term

05:36:59.750 --> 05:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
term
 
05:37:01.910 --> 05:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
um like what what
 
05:37:04.128 --> 05:37:04.138 align:start position:0%
kind of groups are we going to be
 
05:37:05.570 --> 05:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
studying and what's going to be the long
 
05:37:07.788 --> 05:37:07.798 align:start position:0%
term and what are some of the costs and
 
05:37:09.170 --> 05:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
what are some of the policies that may
 
05:37:12.110 --> 05:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
need to change so and none of those are
 
05:37:13.788 --> 05:37:13.798 align:start position:0%
established yet but we're hoping to do
 
05:37:16.010 --> 05:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
that within one year and this is through
 
05:37:18.470 --> 05:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
this funding is also through preschool
 
05:37:19.970 --> 05:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
development grants so we're trying to
 
05:37:22.128 --> 05:37:22.138 align:start position:0%
get some facilitators
 
05:37:24.288 --> 05:37:24.298 align:start position:0%
um that will help us move us along that
 
05:37:27.288 --> 05:37:27.298 align:start position:0%
are well versed in the topic yeah thank
 
05:37:27.298 --> 05:37:28.250 align:start position:0%
are well versed in the topic yeah thank
you

05:37:28.250 --> 05:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:37:30.170 --> 05:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
other questions come representative
 
05:37:33.110 --> 05:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
Gerhart just one quick one madam
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's you said you're talking to parents
 
05:37:36.590 --> 05:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
to find out what they need or want for
 
05:37:38.270 --> 05:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
preschool needs wouldn't it be easier
 
05:37:39.830 --> 05:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
just to provide the money to parents for
 
05:37:41.330 --> 05:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
said services and they could choose the
 
05:37:43.010 --> 05:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
ones they want and then we could avoid
 
05:37:44.270 --> 05:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
creating a whole new department and all
 
05:37:46.610 --> 05:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
the bureaucracy associated with it that
 
05:37:49.670 --> 05:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:52.430 --> 05:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me representative Lucas
 
05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
thank you um so if I correct my my
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
understanding if it's if it's wrong but
 
05:37:59.628 --> 05:37:59.638 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
05:38:01.610 --> 05:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to we're being asked to
 
05:38:05.208 --> 05:38:05.218 align:start position:0%
gear up an entire department for a pilot
 
05:38:07.550 --> 05:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
study which seems a little strange to me
 
05:38:09.708 --> 05:38:09.718 align:start position:0%
particularly since there's already a
 
05:38:12.350 --> 05:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
pilot yes in progress it makes seems to
 
05:38:17.030 --> 05:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:21.350 --> 05:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
me what someone
 
05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I think it makes sense that we are
 
05:38:26.930 --> 05:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
looking at and elevating the need for an
 
05:38:30.170 --> 05:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
office of Early Childhood so that we can
 
05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
think about how we use the funds the
 
05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
05:38:34.080 --> 05:38:34.910 align:start position:0%
federal funds
um

05:38:34.910 --> 05:38:34.920 align:start position:0%

05:38:36.890 --> 05:38:36.900 align:start position:0%

05:38:43.788 --> 05:38:43.798 align:start position:0%

05:38:49.980 --> 05:38:51.770 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

05:38:51.770 --> 05:38:51.780 align:start position:0%

05:39:07.850 --> 05:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
but if you want to recommend killing it
 
05:39:28.010 --> 05:39:28.020 align:start position:0%

it's the name of that Cemetery sounds
 
05:40:29.390 --> 05:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
Vaguely Familiar but it's not one of the
 
05:40:31.610 --> 05:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
big ones in Epson and she'll she'll be
 
05:40:33.948 --> 05:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
able she started The Descendants she's
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
like big into the lineage societies so
 
05:40:37.550 --> 05:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
she started the descendants of New
 
05:40:37.560 --> 05:40:40.030 align:start position:0%
she started the descendants of New
Hampshire

05:40:40.030 --> 05:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:48.970 --> 05:40:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:51.230 --> 05:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
but at least if you started in the right
 
05:40:55.810 --> 05:40:55.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:58.610 --> 05:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
there's a recycling bin unless you think
 
05:41:07.550 --> 05:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:19.930 --> 05:41:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:22.850 --> 05:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
you're not talking right into it you're
 
05:41:25.128 --> 05:41:25.138 align:start position:0%
not getting much of it
 
05:41:25.138 --> 05:41:27.378 align:start position:0%
not getting much of it
foreign
