00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
provided that document is a great tool
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
for you all
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
um for each of our different accounting
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
units and bureaus
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
we have a description of
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
the work that each of those sections
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
completes each year
 
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
um with some actual metrics around
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
what can be accomplished with the
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
dollars that are provided
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
as well as information on how many
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
full-time employees we have supporting
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
that area of the department
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
um so we won't walk through that budget
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
book today
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
in detail and we'll start with this high
 
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.070 align:start position:0%
in detail and we'll start with this high
level

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
overview presentation but we look
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the committee
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
and coming back to provide any
 
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
that you might need from us as you work
 
00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.909 align:start position:0%
that you might need from us as you work
on

00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
the budget for 22 and 23. the other
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
document that we'll be mailing out with
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
the budget books
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
is our factbook um while we
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know are going to be working with
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
you on the budget itself and we
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
recognize that there might be other
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
questions that you have you know maybe
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
questions on projects in your region of
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
or specific questions about our
 
00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:21.589 align:start position:0%
or specific questions about our
operations

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
and so we have a fact book that we
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
prepare at the start of every
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
um legislative session so that
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
most importantly you have contact
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
information for everyone at the vot
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
and can get answers to questions as they
 
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
and can get answers to questions as they
arise

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
arise
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
um so look out for the hard copies of
 
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
both the budget book and our factbook
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
but this morning we're going to walk you
 
00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:43.759 align:start position:0%
through a presentation you're going to
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%

mission here at dot is
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
to provide transportation excellence
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
enhancing the quality of life in new
 
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.710 align:start position:0%
enhancing the quality of life in new
hampshire

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
we are very aware that the work that we
 
00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
we are very aware that the work that we
do

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
each and every day significantly impacts
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
every person traveling through new
 
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.270 align:start position:0%
every person traveling through new
hampshire

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
and every one of our residents but most
 
00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:30.710 align:start position:0%
and every one of our residents but most
importantly

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're in the business of meeting of
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
moving people and goods which directly
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
impacts the state's economy
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
and so we are trying to provide
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
a safe reliable and well-maintained
 
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.710 align:start position:0%
a safe reliable and well-maintained
system

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
and so that everyone can get where they
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
need to go and that goods and services
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
can be delivered
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
and we work very diligently to stretch
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
the value of the dollars that were
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
provided to deliver on this mission and
 
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.350 align:start position:0%
provided to deliver on this mission and
purpose

00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
so just so you understand how
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
our org chart looks um so we have three
 
00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.150 align:start position:0%
our org chart looks um so we have three
commissioners

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
myself and bill cass as assistant
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner and chief engineer
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
oversees all things highway and that
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
includes the division of project
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
development and the division of
 
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.670 align:start position:0%
development and the division of
operations

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
and then chris washcheck as our deputy
 
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.870 align:start position:0%
and then chris washcheck as our deputy
commissioner

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
oversees our other three divisions
 
00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.070 align:start position:0%
oversees our other three divisions
finance

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
policy administration as well as
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
aeronautics rail and transit
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
this particular representation of
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
our department makes it look like we're
 
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.750 align:start position:0%
our department makes it look like we're
quite

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
quite
 
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
siloed but in reality we're a very flat
 
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.829 align:start position:0%
siloed but in reality we're a very flat
organization

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
and so for example the bureau of
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
environment is
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
under the division of project
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
development but they support the entire
 
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.310 align:start position:0%
development but they support the entire
department

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
um even on occasion aeronautics rail and
 
00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.670 align:start position:0%
um even on occasion aeronautics rail and
transit

00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
transit
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
as necessary so while we have technical
 
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
as necessary so while we have technical
disciplines

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
disciplines
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
located within one division there are
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
resources being brought to bear
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
across all of our different programs and
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
work effort
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
so how do we manage all of this work um
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the three
 
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.430 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the three
commissioners

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
we have a director for each of the
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
divisions and then for the larger
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
divisions of project development and
 
00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
divisions of project development and
operations

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
we also have an assistant director
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
providing support
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
in each of those areas and perhaps the
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
most important piece of information
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
today is the phone number on the screen
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
that is the front office direct line so
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
anytime you have questions for
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
commissioners or directors
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
please use that number and we are here
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
to help
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
and kathy is also on today because she
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
acts as our
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison and so if for any
 
00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:59.190 align:start position:0%
legislative liaison and so if for any
reason

00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
you're looking for information and it's
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
particularly time sensitive
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
you can always reach out to kathy
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
directly and she will
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
collect the information from the
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
responsible party here at d.o.t
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
um so just to give you a sense of um
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
how big our agency is and what our
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
we have around 1650 full-time employees
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
in addition we have a number of both
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
part-time as well as seasonal employees
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
and for example in the bureau of
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
turnpikes many of our toll-taker
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
positions are part-time positions
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
and then because of the nature of our
 
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
and then because of the nature of our
work

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
we do hire seasonal employees either for
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
the winter season
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
or for the summer construction season
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
depending on the area
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
and the programs that we are responsible
 
00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.990 align:start position:0%
and the programs that we are responsible
for

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
on the highway side of the house we have
 
00:12:00.389 --> 00:12:00.399 align:start position:0%
2160 state bridges that we're
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
one of the statistics that's always of
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
interest to the legislature
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
is how many of those bridges are on what
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
we in new hampshire call the red list
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
the red list is really
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
a list of all of the bridges that are
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
considered structurally deficient in the
 
00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:19.829 align:start position:0%
considered structurally deficient in the
state

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
in other words structures that are in a
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
poor or very poor condition
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
um they are they are safe we inspect
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
them much more frequently
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
we actually go out there every six
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
months to check them rather than every
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
but those are bridges that are reaching
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
their useful life and need either
 
00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.269 align:start position:0%
their useful life and need either
significant

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
rehab or replacement so
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
this is a number that we always pay
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
close attention to
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
so as we work on the budget we'll be
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
the condition of the infrastructure and
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
then the
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
funding as well as the personnel needed
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
to continue to
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
address both our bridges and our
 
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.110 align:start position:0%
address both our bridges and our
payments

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh commissioner if i could
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh are your 650 employees
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
is that the authorized number of
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
employees or is that what you actually
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
have on the end
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
that is the authorized number of
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
positions um later on we'll talk about
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
one of our challenges
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
last year with the budget or sorry with
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
the funding uncertainty
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
and revenue impacts of covet 19
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
the governor implemented a hiring freeze
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
and we do have a very high vacancy rate
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
that we're working to address but we'll
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
talk about that in more detail
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
later in the presentation okay i just
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to be sure that was authorized
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you and then in addition
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
to our state-owned assets we also are
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for inspecting
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
all of the municipal bridges in the
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
state of which there's around 1690.
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
um we are not responsible for the work
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's performed on
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
those structures but we do inspect them
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
and work closely with the towns
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
to make them aware of any issues that
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
there might be
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
and then on the highway side we're
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
responsible for approximately 4 600
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
center lane miles of roadway
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
most of that roadway is both summer and
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
winter maintained by the department um
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
but there is approximately 300 miles
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
that are owned by dot and town
 
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.949 align:start position:0%
that are owned by dot and town
maintained

00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
and with um this number of miles
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
of highway every year we're striving to
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
pave around 550 center lane miles
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's what's required to keep our
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
pavement infrastructure in a good state
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
of repair
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk a little bit more about
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
this number as well as we move through
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
the presentation
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
but we're not just responsible for
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
bridges and pavements there's
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
countless other roadside assets out
 
00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.670 align:start position:0%
countless other roadside assets out
there

00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
from all of our highway signs to our
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
guard rail
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
um every year we have to strike the
 
00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:07.430 align:start position:0%
um every year we have to strike the
roadways

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
roadways
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then of course there's all the
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
traffic signals and
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
other devices along our highways as well
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
so we have been working to build up
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
inventories in all of these areas
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
and then not on the screen and obviously
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
there are pipes
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
culverts and closed drainage systems as
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
well as sidewalks and crosswalks and
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
other assets that we're responsible for
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
and then we are multimodal dot as i
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have a division of
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
aeronautics rail and transit
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
while we don't operate um air rail or
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
bus service as a dot
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
um we do work very closely with of the
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
providers of those services
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
in the state um so there's 195 miles of
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
active state-owned rail line as well as
 
00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.230 align:start position:0%
active state-owned rail line as well as
24

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
public access airports in the state and
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
11 public transit systems that we
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
partner with
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about that in a little
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
bit more detail in a few minutes
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
next slide um so at this point i'm going
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
to turn it over to chris wojcik
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
who will give you a high level overview
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
of the budget
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
and then as the presentation progresses
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
we'll do a deeper dive
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
so chris good morning members of the
 
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:18.870 align:start position:0%
so chris good morning members of the
committee

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
um so this slide with this shows
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
is uh fiscal year 20 20
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
actual expenditures um
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
which were much lower than the budget
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
and we the actual expenses were 681
 
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.749 align:start position:0%
and we the actual expenses were 681
million

00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
um on the municipal aid and construction
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
side 419 million and on the operating
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
side 262 million so
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
for example aid that will include block
 
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.189 align:start position:0%
for example aid that will include block
granted

00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
granted
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
um passed which is a direct pass-through
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
from our budget to the municipalities uh
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
it also includes
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh indirect um technical and program
 
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.189 align:start position:0%
uh indirect um technical and program
assistance

00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
such as the tap program um construction
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
costs primarily consist of
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
projects that are in the 10-year plan
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
the department progresses
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
on the operating side uh basically those
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
costs are
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
cost for the requirement to maintain and
 
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.630 align:start position:0%
cost for the requirement to maintain and
operate

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
operate
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
the current infrastructure um as well as
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
to plan engineer and oversee the
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
construction program
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
primarily two thirds
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
is uh municipalities of construction
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
um and then the rest for the operating
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
as you can see
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the entire budget is a makeup of
 
00:17:47.909 --> 00:17:47.919 align:start position:0%
highway fund which is 36 percent
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
the federal program federal funds which
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
flow through
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
the highway fund um 35
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
the turnpike uh funds 19
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
other which may be non-budgeted
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures such as
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
tiffia and bonded capital projects those
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
those are the other and then um general
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
fund is
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
the one percent uh next slide
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
this is kind of the history of
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
authorized full-time positions
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
um on the previous slide commissioner
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
reported that 1650
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
were our current level of authorized
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
positions you can see that
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
has been the case in the current
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
biennium and then that is the case
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
we're not adding any additional
 
00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:38.710 align:start position:0%
we're not adding any additional
positions

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
but one thing i want to note here is
 
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:41.990 align:start position:0%
but one thing i want to note here is
that

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
our authorized positions have fallen
 
00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:45.190 align:start position:0%
our authorized positions have fallen
dramatically

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh since 2010. you can see
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
that in 2010 we had over 1828 positions
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
and we're roughly 178 fewer positions
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
today and we have been at that level for
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
quite some time
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that i just want to
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
point out
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
that we have a 15
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate right now um
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
so we have 241 vacant positions and we
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
are working
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
actively to fill those uh the department
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
in a really um challenged
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
um with the hiring freeze and being able
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
to keep up with
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
um all the work so we are we are moving
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
forward to uh phil
 
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh with the hiring freeze being lifted
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the vacancy rate uh
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
15 a little over 15
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
so here's the funding summary for um
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh budget or the governor's recommended
 
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.230 align:start position:0%
uh budget or the governor's recommended
budget

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:20:06.789 --> 00:20:06.799 align:start position:0%
on fiscal year 22 it's 674 million
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh municipal aid and construction 354
 
00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:10.230 align:start position:0%
uh municipal aid and construction 354
million

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
operating 320 million um
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
and then in fiscal year 23 um
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
684 million on the municipality of
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
construction 350
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
and operating uh 334 i do want to point
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
um when i did present fiscal year 20
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
the operating side was considerably
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
lower and that's because of
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
when covet hit you know we really uh
 
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
tightened our tightened up belt i would
 
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.029 align:start position:0%
tightened our tightened up belt i would
say

00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
and only um expended uh absolutely
 
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.669 align:start position:0%
and only um expended uh absolutely
necessary

00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
um you know budget and um
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
we had a very very high lapse in fiscal
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
year 20
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
because of the impacts on covert
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
and um the need to really watch
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
how much was spent a lot of things in
 
00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919 align:start position:0%
that year
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
did not get done you know so this
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
is a budget that you know really
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
you know tries to do all the necessary
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
things that the department is
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
responsible for in
 
00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.039 align:start position:0%
in order to operate and maintain the
 
00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:20.070 align:start position:0%
in order to operate and maintain the
system

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
as well as progress the projects in a
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
so this is just a makeup um and it shows
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
fy 20 actuals uh the fy20 adjusted
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
authorized um
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
our agency budget and governor's budget
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
present um
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
proposals for 22 as well as 23.
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
um and you can see the light blue is
 
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.430 align:start position:0%
um and you can see the light blue is
federal

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:50.130 align:start position:0%
uh so you can see federal is pretty um
 
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.270 align:start position:0%
uh so you can see federal is pretty um
[Music]

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
pretty stable at the roughly a little
 
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
over 200 million
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
level with the exception of fiscal year
 
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.830 align:start position:0%
level with the exception of fiscal year
22

00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
that jumps up to 248 million excuse me
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
where new hampshire is receiving 41
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and we're putting that right into the
 
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.029 align:start position:0%
um and we're putting that right into the
budget

00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
to offset the revenue loss so you can
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
see there's a considerable jump in
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
um from what we presented um
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
at the 207 million to 248 million that's
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
the 41 million of
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
cobit relief funds from the federal
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
government um
 
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
so perhaps chris if you don't mind we'll
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
pause for a second to explain what
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
relief dollars transportation has
 
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:41.430 align:start position:0%
relief dollars transportation has
received

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
so when the cares act was passed there
 
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.230 align:start position:0%
so when the cares act was passed there
was

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
direct assistance provided
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
to aeronautics and to
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
public transportation but in that first
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
package there was
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
nothing specifically dedicated to
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
highway uses
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
later on when subsequent relief packages
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
were passed including the
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
package that was approved by congress at
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
the end
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
of calendar year 2020 then there was
 
00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.190 align:start position:0%
of calendar year 2020 then there was
additional

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
monies provided once again for airports
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
and for public transportation
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
but that last relief bill also provided
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the 41
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
million for highways to address lost
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
revenue so that's what chris is
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
in addition the department has been
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
supporting some of the statewide
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
response to covet 19
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
performing tasks that don't pertain
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
directly to transportation but doing our
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
part to support the governor and other
 
00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:39.190 align:start position:0%
part to support the governor and other
agencies

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
and so we have also been reimbursed with
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
either fema dollars or shall be
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursed in the future for the work
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
that we're performing currently
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
or we did receive some of the gopher
 
00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
relief funds as well
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
um so i just wanted to make sure that
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
you weren't thinking it was all coming
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
from one pot
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
we actually did receive dedicated funds
 
00:23:59.360 --> 00:23:59.750 align:start position:0%
we actually did receive dedicated funds
in

00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
the cares act and then in the subsequent
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
relief bill
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about the 1.25 billion
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
of gopher funds
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
although dot did have access to that as
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
well sorry chris
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
no thank you for that commissioner um
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
that helps explain
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
that funding much better you can see
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
other funding um levels are pretty
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
pretty stable at around that low
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
80 million dollar range general funds
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
which basically fund our um aeronautics
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
rail and transit bureaus
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh they are very stable at that 1.3 to
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
1.6 million dollar level
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
um little general funds flow into
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
the department on the highway side um
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
i noted that the actuals were
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know considerably low in fiscal year
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
20. um on the highway side we
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
expended 194 million that yet because of
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know the department's diligent and
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
really uh watching how
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
highway funds were being expended um in
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh the budgeted level was 230 million
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
um in the 22 and 23
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
budgets we're slightly below that
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
i'm in 22 and right about that with the
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
governor's budget in 23.
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and then the turnpike side is fairly
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh stable at the um
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
at that 157 million dollar range
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
and now talk about the turnpike um in a
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
few moments but that
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
does include both operating and capital
 
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.470 align:start position:0%
does include both operating and capital
work

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
um on the turnpike side the turnpike
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
system also took a hit in 2012 uh fiscal
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
year 20 due to covert
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
so you can see the expenditures were
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
dramatically lower
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
um on the turnpike side as well
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
and i'll turn this over to the
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner to talk about um
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely um what how much was the
 
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.710 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely um what how much was the
labs

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
labs
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
please um
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
our laps was 37 million dollars last
 
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.310 align:start position:0%
our laps was 37 million dollars last
year

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
obviously that's not sustainable we feel
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh there were a lot of
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
um new programs that were budgeted
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh for preventative maintenance and
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
equipment that we were not
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
able to purchase and that's was a reason
 
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
why there was such a significant lapse
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
later in the presentation we'll talk
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
about the issues and challenges and
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more about where we
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
lapsed the dollars
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
last year if i made that lapse was
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
only on the highway side that 37 million
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
the marine noted
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
is only in highway funds the turnpike
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
system also lapsed
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
a considerable dollar value i don't have
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
it right in front of me but
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
um it was close to 10 million
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
yeah and i'll just say that's d.o.t not
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
so we'll start by talking about the
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
um since we used so few general fund
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
dollars um well we'll go from smallest
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
to largest program
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
and talk about the highway fund
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
last and so a little bit of a deeper
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
dive on
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
the bureaus of aeronautics rail and
 
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.789 align:start position:0%
the bureaus of aeronautics rail and
transit

00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
transit
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned we work closely with all
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
of the public use airports
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
we inspect the airports and
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
many of those that qualify for federal
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
funds those federal dollars
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
flow through the department as well so
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
there are three commercial airports in
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
manchester lebanon and peace and so we
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
work closely with those three commercial
 
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.389 align:start position:0%
work closely with those three commercial
airports

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
airports
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
but then there's what we call block
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
grand airports and that's the other
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
nine airport that are eligible for
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's some smaller
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
airports that do not receive federal aid
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
and we provide some assistance to those
 
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.029 align:start position:0%
and we provide some assistance to those
airports

00:28:25.029 --> 00:28:25.039 align:start position:0%
airports
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
with the revenues that we collect from
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
aircraft registration
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
and the department is responsible for
 
00:28:32.399 --> 00:28:33.110 align:start position:0%
and the department is responsible for
registering

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
registering
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
all aircraft in the state and so while
 
00:28:36.399 --> 00:28:36.950 align:start position:0%
all aircraft in the state and so while
we

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
have less day-to-day operational
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities at the airports
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
we are very much working hand-in-hand
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
with them and advocating on their behalf
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
on the rail side i mentioned before that
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
active state-owned track in new
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire so we have 195 miles of
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
active track that the d.o.t owns
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
and we have six operating agreements uh
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
with four freight
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
providers and two tourist services that
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
run on those corridors in addition
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
there's about 340 miles of
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
inactive corridor which
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
we oversee
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
and coordinate the management of many of
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
these corridors are being used for
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
rail trails as an interim use and we
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
partner with the department of natural
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
specifically the bureau of trails who
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
have some of the day-to-day management
 
00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:34.070 align:start position:0%
have some of the day-to-day management
responsibilities

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
for these sections and then lastly on
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
the public transit side
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
there are 11 local public transit
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
systems that we work with
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
in addition we do coordinate with all of
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
the private bus
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
operators in new hampshire and then
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
lastly we operate our own intercity
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
commuter service called the boston
 
00:29:56.159 --> 00:29:57.830 align:start position:0%
commuter service called the boston
express

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
express
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
there is an operating agreement with
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
concrete coach who provides that service
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
but it is a state funded service
 
00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
but beyond the the fixed route services
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
um that our
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
our transit systems provide um we're
 
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.870 align:start position:0%
our transit systems provide um we're
also

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
responsible for the allocation of
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
federal transit dollars to community
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
transportation providers and
 
00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:22.870 align:start position:0%
transportation providers and
specifically

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
human service and volunteer driver
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
programs that are serving
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
primarily you know seniors and
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities
 
00:30:32.549 --> 00:30:32.559 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of different types of
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
federal funding that come from the
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
federal transit administration with very
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
strict parameters in how we can spend
 
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.630 align:start position:0%
strict parameters in how we can spend
that

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
um from the dollars that are committed
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
to our smaller urban
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
systems to dollars that go to rural
 
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.549 align:start position:0%

00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%

00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
and then lastly the human service
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
and volunteer driver programs excuse me
 
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.990 align:start position:0%
and volunteer driver programs excuse me
commissioner

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
did you say that d.o.t runs the boston
 
00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.389 align:start position:0%
did you say that d.o.t runs the boston
express

00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
express
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
yep that's a state-owned service that is
 
00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:03.509 align:start position:0%
yep that's a state-owned service that is
operated

00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
operated
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
by concord coach contract with us
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
is that profitable or do they conquer
 
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:10.710 align:start position:0%
is that profitable or do they conquer
coach

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
coach
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
pro gives you money and
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
um so pre-pandemic this was one of the
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
most successful bus
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
services in the country we
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
started to provide this service as one
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
of our commitments
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
as we advanced the widening of i-93 from
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
salem to manchester
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
and um we have seen
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
great ridership pre-pandemic with um
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
record numbers uh riding specifically on
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
the fb everett route 3 corridor
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
and um i would say
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
that service had been thriving and
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
obviously since the pandemic
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh with the reduction in commuter
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
traffic um
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know we are trying to project what
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
the future holds
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
for all of our um inter-city and
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
commuter bus services
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
because certainly we're not seeing the
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
ridership that we were previously with
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
so many people continuing to telework
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
um and not drive down to the city as
 
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.389 align:start position:0%
um and not drive down to the city as
often

00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's also folks who would go down to
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
boston for medical appointments as an
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
example that rely heavily
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
on this service as well as individuals
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
who were flying from logan airport
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
who rely on these services to get to the
 
00:32:25.919 --> 00:32:27.430 align:start position:0%
who rely on these services to get to the
city

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
city
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
the customers just haven't come back yet
 
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.310 align:start position:0%
the customers just haven't come back yet
because

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
telemedicine is still being used and
 
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.509 align:start position:0%
telemedicine is still being used and
vacation

00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
travel is still significantly limited
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much next slide please
 
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:49.190 align:start position:0%
thank you very much next slide please
marie

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
um so the uh
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
the general funds that we're allocated
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
are primarily
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
going to fund the aeronautics bureau and
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
the railroad bureau
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
the transit bureau is primarily funded
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
with federal funds
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
and earlier i mentioned that we received
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
assistance through the cares act
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
and usually we have to come up with
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
the match for both operating and capital
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
purchases on our transit systems
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the cares act provisions
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
have allowed us to
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
access 100 federal funding and
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
that certainly um reduces
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh the burden on municipalities and
 
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
others who
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
um were struggling to come up with the
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
match to access some of those federal
 
00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.509 align:start position:0%
match to access some of those federal
dollars

00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
so our budget currently includes two
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand per year of general
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
funds for transit operating
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
match um to access those federal dollars
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
so our budget's very small on the
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
general fund side for 2022
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
it's 1.5 million and for 2023
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's 1.6 million um we only had
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
one additional need in our agency phase
 
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:03.750 align:start position:0%
one additional need in our agency phase
um

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
and that was actually funded by the
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
governor in his
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
phase uh during the last budget we had
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
requested a new position
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
um an aeronautics uh planning position
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
obviously um what we call uas's
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
or what people not commonly referred to
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
as drones
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
is an industry that's expanding very
 
00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.629 align:start position:0%
is an industry that's expanding very
rapidly

00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
and so um during the last budget we
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
advocated for a position that could be
 
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.230 align:start position:0%
advocated for a position that could be
dedicated

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
to working through some of the
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
challenges with
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
the increase in the number of drones
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
operating in the state
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
that position was funded in the last
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
budget but
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
challenges we did not move forward with
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
filling it and so that position
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
is included in the governor's budget and
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to move forward with
 
00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
filling that vacancy
 
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
and now that there is more certainty
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
around future revenues
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so that really is all of our
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
information to share on the general fund
 
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.190 align:start position:0%
information to share on the general fund
side

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
and we'd be happy to answer any
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
remaining questions or
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
if you specifically would like more
 
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.510 align:start position:0%
if you specifically would like more
information

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
on the various services that are
 
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.069 align:start position:0%
on the various services that are
provided

00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
or have questions about aeronautics
 
00:35:19.589 --> 00:35:19.599 align:start position:0%
rail or transit funding that we receive
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
all right i'm hearing none so i think i
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't i don't see any hands raised
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll turn it back to chris and
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
he'll talk about the turnpike system in
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
hello again so just to give you a brief
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
overview of
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system in you know where
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's located basically in the
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
southeastern part of the state
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
um on the the turnpike system is really
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
made up of three turnpike segments
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
the central turnpike extends from the
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
state line in nashua
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
all the way up to exit 14 in concord
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
so it it runs along uh route 3 of the
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
ffe everett
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
from nashua through through merrimack
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's co-joined with 293 through
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
manchester and then
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
um and then meets up with 93 through the
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
hooks of toll plaza
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then like i said ends at exit 14 in
 
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.230 align:start position:0%
and then like i said ends at exit 14 in
concord

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
concord
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
um on the eastern side we have both the
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
blue star
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
which runs from state line to state line
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
on i-95
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
and then the spaulding which runs from
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth traffic circle
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
um all the way up to
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
exit 18 in milton so it's 89 miles long
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
in total
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
172 bridges uh eight toll facilities
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
um it is an enterprise fund so for
 
00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:50.710 align:start position:0%
um it is an enterprise fund so for
example

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
all the turnpike revenue that's
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
collected on the turnpike system must be
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
used on the turnpike it cannot be used
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
for any other purpose turnpike revenue
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
pays for operation
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
and maintenance on the system any debt
 
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.670 align:start position:0%
and maintenance on the system any debt
service

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
that exists on the current outstanding
 
00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.150 align:start position:0%
that exists on the current outstanding
bonds

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
that we use to build portions of the
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
system are in our work which is in
 
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.030 align:start position:0%
system are in our work which is in
essence

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
essence
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
work that is done to make sure the
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
system's in
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
good working order that work entails
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
paving uh drainage guardrail some bridge
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
preservation work
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
and then lastly it flows down to the
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
capital program
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh such as you know the major projects
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
underway in the 10-year plan and the
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
effie ever widening
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
manchester exit six and the bull
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
concrete project just recently
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh the newington dover project on the
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
spa then got completed
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that's basically what the capital
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
improvements entail
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
and all that is including the 10-year
 
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
and all that is including the 10-year
plan

00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 there were 110 million
 
00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:57.670 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 there were 110 million
transactions

00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
transactions
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
um with the total revenue of 131 million
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
um just for comparison purposes
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh we use fiscal year 19 kind of to
 
00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
uh we use fiscal year 19 kind of to
compare

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
compare
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
from the you know kind of pre-covert to
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
post covert effect
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
so in fiscal year 19 we had 123.7
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
million transactions so in fiscal year
 
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.270 align:start position:0%
million transactions so in fiscal year
20

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
those 11 field transactions
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
so this kind of shows um over the last
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
10 years going back to
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2010 kind of what the fund
 
00:38:33.599 --> 00:38:35.030 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2010 kind of what the fund
history

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
for tow revenue looks like and you can
 
00:38:37.359 --> 00:38:38.390 align:start position:0%
for tow revenue looks like and you can
see

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's fairly flat in 2010 11 through
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
14 at about that 117 million
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
then it started to rise uh in fiscal
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
year 19 it kind of peaked
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
um at 145 million of toll revenue
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
an additional 8.7 million of other
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
revenue which
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
consists of interests we have
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
a build america bond subsidy uh hooksett
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh welcome center revenue things like
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
that um and then
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
um covet hit and it has had a huge
 
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.390 align:start position:0%
um covet hit and it has had a huge
impact

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
on the system um fiscally at
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
20 um revenues down about
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh 11 from fiscal year 19.
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal year 21 we're forecasting
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up at about 17
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
lower than fiscal year 19 and then it's
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
going to start
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
improving um but feels good yet 22 and
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
23 we're still going to be down
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
13 and 9 below fiscal year 19 high
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
so that just kind of gives you a
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
snapshot of
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
what's happening on the turnpike system
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
so here we've been able to track
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
the impact that covert has had on
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
traffic this is
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
this is a counter actually that it's an
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
automated counter that we have
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
in conquered on i-93 between exits 12
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
and 13.
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh you can see and and i do want to say
 
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:09.190 align:start position:0%
uh you can see and and i do want to say
that

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
this shape of a graph
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
is very similar to what's happening on
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
precovered back last february
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
in 2020 traffic was slightly higher than
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
the previous
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
year and this gives you a comparison of
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
the current year uh to the previous
 
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.270 align:start position:0%
the current year uh to the previous
years

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
same week traffic when covert hit
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
traffic dropped
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
dramatically at this counter dropped
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
down to 50 percent
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
below the previous year's level um
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
that was back at the end of march uh
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
first week in april of last year and
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
then it started climbing back up
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
as things opened up a little bit
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh in the summertime in june and july
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
traffic was roughly between 14
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
um i would say 12 to 14 below the
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
and then that kind of existed through
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
into the early fall and then again we're
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
now seeing traffic
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
settling at about uh 18 to 20
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
below last year's levels now certainly
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
up in the north country in the western
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
part of the state i think traffic
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
um although it has a similar shape has
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
not been
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
as significant in terms of
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
reduction um the north country and
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
western part of the state may be seeing
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
traffic at about 10
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
15 lower uh than previous year whereas
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
again this is at about 18 to 20 percent
 
00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.230 align:start position:0%
again this is at about 18 to 20 percent
lower

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
lower
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike system traffic uh the
 
00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:47.270 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike system traffic uh the
low

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
peaked at 58 um
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
below the previous year's level that
 
00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
again was at the end of march early
 
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.109 align:start position:0%
again was at the end of march early
april

00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
april
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
and right now we're seeing traffic right
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
around the 20
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh below last year's level so
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
very significant impact on revenue next
 
00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:09.030 align:start position:0%
very significant impact on revenue next
slide

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
so on the turnpikes um what we do is we
 
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:13.510 align:start position:0%
so on the turnpikes um what we do is we
have

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
a model which helps us
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
with a 10-year plan
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
as well as we take a look at what we
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
need for operation and maintenance
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
and covert has had a huge impact um on
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
so we do have a consultant
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
that does uh traffic and revenue
 
00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:38.870 align:start position:0%
that does uh traffic and revenue
forecasting

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
forecasting
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
um they do investment grades so for
 
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.069 align:start position:0%
um they do investment grades so for
example

00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
if the turnpike system goes uh to secure
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
additional bonding um investment grade
 
00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
traffic and revenue information is
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
necessary so this consultant firm
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
helps us with that uh the blue line
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
represents uh their forecast from
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
october 2019.
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh you can see that fiscal year 20 was
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to be right about the 120
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
135 million level um it increased
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
um beyond 22 and about a little over a
 
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.430 align:start position:0%
um beyond 22 and about a little over a
percent

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
um a year um with covert
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh and we're taking they get they gave
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
us a low
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
estimated range mid-range and really
 
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.069 align:start position:0%
estimated range mid-range and really
severe

00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
severe
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we've taken their mid-range um impact
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
and you can see fiscal year 20 um we're
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
roughly down almost 15 million dollars
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
um in total revenue from the previous
 
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.710 align:start position:0%
um in total revenue from the previous
forecast

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
forecast
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
this week 21 down 23 million
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
and then fiscal year 22 uh 12 and 23
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh 10 million so in aggregate there
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a very significant
 
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:51.829 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a very significant
impact

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
over from fiscal year 20 to 24 we're
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
talking about a 71 million dollar
 
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.750 align:start position:0%
talking about a 71 million dollar
reduction

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
in total revenue from what was
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
previously forecasted
 
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
over this 10-year period we're looking
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
at 121 million lower than what was
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
previously forecasted
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
which is going to have an impact on the
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
the capital work uh on the turnpike
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
system we're going to see
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
potential delays anywhere from one to
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
two years on some of those capital
 
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.510 align:start position:0%
two years on some of those capital
projects

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
um and we'll we'll be able to manage
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
that um but i just want to give the
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
just like a little bit of an insight
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
into how covert has impacted the channel
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
pack system
 
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
and certainly there's a similar impact
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
on the highway side
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative murray you have
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
a question
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um why
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the revenues rebound back to
 
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.230 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the revenues rebound back to
pre-covert

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
pre-covert
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
is this uh indication that you think
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
telecommuting is going is basically a
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
thing to stay is here to say
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
yes so what this what they were basing
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
their uh projections on
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
was over lasting anywhere this this
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
this covert impact they're lasting
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere from three to six years
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
and then long term they feel
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
that this virtual work environment
 
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
is going to have an impact on um
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
the commute to what extent you know we
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
picked the mid-range you know certainly
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
on the lower end you know they're
 
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.790 align:start position:0%
on the lower end you know they're
thinking

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
it could be anywhere from you know one
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
day a week
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
to two days a week and if you really
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
think about that one
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
if one if everybody works from home one
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
day a week
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's a 20 reduction you know so
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
um long term they they're going to have
 
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.270 align:start position:0%
um long term they they're going to have
some

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
i mean some firms require people to go
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
back to the office full time
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
um and maybe have a maybe a more liberal
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
work from home
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
type of approach you're going to have
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
other firms that will allow people to
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
work from home
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
you know entirely so it is going to
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
change the landscape
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
i think of how traffic is going to
 
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.510 align:start position:0%
i think of how traffic is going to
evolve

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
evolve
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
long term now what we're also seeing
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
um just very early is that there were
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
more local trips occurring
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
um so these trips really are more of the
 
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.550 align:start position:0%
um so these trips really are more of the
long

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
commuting trips and that's what's
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
happening on the turnpike system that's
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
more of a commuter
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
and recreational um corridors
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
but i think people as they work from
 
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.550 align:start position:0%
but i think people as they work from
home

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
yeah they're traveling more
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe as many miles maybe slightly
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
fewer miles but they're traveling
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
more locally and not necessarily on the
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
interstates and turnpike systems
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
while covet 19 has had some devastating
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
impacts on
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
individuals the explosion of technology
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
will have lasting benefits for everyone
 
00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:47.829 align:start position:0%
will have lasting benefits for everyone
so

00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
we've in the transportation sector we're
 
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the four different types
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
of trips
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
there's the the commuting trips where
 
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.150 align:start position:0%
there's the the commuting trips where
telework

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
telework
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
is likely to continue
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
to be expanded beyond pre-covered levels
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
so as chris is saying you know
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
firms obviously they want to get people
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
back in the office
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
people are craving that human
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
interaction and especially
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
companies are trying to innovate you
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
need to have people
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
in the room together but it is highly
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
likely folks will be given more
 
00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:19.109 align:start position:0%
likely folks will be given more
flexibility

00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
which is great for work-life balance
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to work from home to a greater
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
extent there's going to be some impact
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
but then i touched on it earlier there
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
is the expansion of telemedicine
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
and so certainly people will still be
 
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.670 align:start position:0%
and so certainly people will still be
traveling

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
traveling
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
to specialty hospitals for consultations
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
but maybe some of that follow-up care
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
can be done
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
locally and use telemedicine to
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
complement that
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
again terrific for the individuals and
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
the quality of the care they're
 
00:47:45.119 --> 00:47:46.069 align:start position:0%
the quality of the care they're
receiving

00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
but travel will be different um you know
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
with higher ed
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
more and more online learning um that's
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
also going to have an impact on trips
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
um as it is we see significant changes
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
in travel patterns when the schools
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
are in session or not um and then the
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
last one of course is online shopping
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
um and the expansion of amazon and other
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
delivery services
 
00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
where people aren't going to the stores
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
as much but the transportation network
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
is just as important for the movement of
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
the goods
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
to the individuals and so as chris
 
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.109 align:start position:0%
to the individuals and so as chris
mentioned

00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
this is a challenging time for our
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
transportation planners
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
we have to work very closely with
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
chambers of commerce and with major
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
employers to understand
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
how they're going to be doing business
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
going forward to know what those lasting
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
impacts are going to be
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
and what their transportation needs are
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we're here to
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
provide the infrastructure to support
 
00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:38.470 align:start position:0%
provide the infrastructure to support
them

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
so we have to continue to listen to how
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
their business model might be changing
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
so that we can understand what the
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
longer term
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
needs are going to be so it's it's great
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
for the individual
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
um the explosive technology is certainly
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
um improving quality life and that's
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
what we're all about
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
but um it's challenging for us to
 
00:48:58.319 --> 00:48:59.190 align:start position:0%
but um it's challenging for us to
forecast

00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
forecast
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
right now while we're still seeing
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
different behavior
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
because of the risks associated with
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
covet 19.
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
we can't discern how people are behaving
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
today is it truly
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
because of changes to to keep reducing
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
the spread and keep people safe
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
or are they permanent changes because
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's a more efficient way for them to do
 
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.750 align:start position:0%
it's a more efficient way for them to do
business

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
very good uh thank you commissioner for
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you guys do an
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
awesome job and uh
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that what's the status
 
00:49:58.079 --> 00:49:58.710 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that what's the status
of

00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
93 is that we on budget and
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
when was the estimated completion date
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
and also exit 4 is the
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic having an effect on that
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
so the expansion project to widen from
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
salem to manchester
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
um that project was declared
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
substantially complete this fall
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
but we are working on some punchless
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
items and finalizing
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
the last few items but essentially that
 
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.670 align:start position:0%
the last few items but essentially that
contract

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
is and that project is complete
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
the other project the construction of
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
exit 4a has been delayed slightly
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
we were advancing that project as a
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
design build contract
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
in other words instead of going all the
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
way through final design
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
and then awarding the construction to a
 
00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:49.190 align:start position:0%
and then awarding the construction to a
contractor

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
we had advanced the plans to about the
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
30 design
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
stage and we were procuring a team to
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
finalize the design
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
and start construction somewhat
 
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.390 align:start position:0%
and start construction somewhat
concurrently

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
concurrently
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
in an effort to try and shorten the
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
overall project duration
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately when we opened the bids on
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
that project the
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
prices came in much much higher than our
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
own dot
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
estimate there's some
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
modifications to the scope that we
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
believe we can make
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
to reduce risk for the contracting teams
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
and hopefully reduce the cost
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
but as a result we have made the
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
determination that is more
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective to advance this
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
as a traditional design
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
bid build project so we have just
 
00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.309 align:start position:0%
bid build project so we have just
procured

00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
procured
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
or selected a designer to work on the
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
final design
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
that effort will be starting shortly and
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
we hope to get that contract before
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
governor council this spring
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
another year after that contract is
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
awarded from
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
being able to finish the first phase
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
so basically we're hoping to break
 
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.589 align:start position:0%
so basically we're hoping to break
ground

00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 2022 and um
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
that project we're very confident that
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
we can deliver it for
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
a cost that is much closer to what we
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
had estimated
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
and um that's what we've set to work
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
doing right now
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
and bill cass is on with us this morning
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill is there anything else you want to
 
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.150 align:start position:0%
bill is there anything else you want to
add

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
no just uh just what you said that uh
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
again back to your initial
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
question representative peter yeah no
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
essentially the 93
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
widening is is complete exit 4a was
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
always a
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know separate uh project interchange
 
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:44.470 align:start position:0%
you know separate uh project interchange
there

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
the one last uh thing that will be going
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
on there is a um
 
00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
there is a restriping contract that is
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
technically part of the 93
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
project it's it is kind of a punchless
 
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
item as the
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner said so next this spring
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
you'll you will see um
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
you know some durable pavement markings
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
for the whole length of of 93
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
and some final punchless items fixing
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
some signs and stuff but
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
eventually it's all done
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
so basically on the turnpike on the
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
turnpike side
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
um because of the covet impacts on
 
00:53:30.319 --> 00:53:31.109 align:start position:0%
um because of the covet impacts on
revenue

00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
it really required uh roughly a seven
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
and a half percent or twelve and a half
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
million dollar budget reduction
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 from from the 21
 
00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:42.230 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 from from the 21
budget

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
that was primarily on the capital side
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
some of the capital work
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
got moved out fiscal year 23's budget is
 
00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:51.430 align:start position:0%
got moved out fiscal year 23's budget is
fair

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
fair
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
is flat fiscal year 22. there were no
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
that were requested all the operation
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance debt service and r r
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
requirements have been funded
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the biennium um and overall as i
 
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:06.870 align:start position:0%
in the biennium um and overall as i
noted

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
noted
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
um we have some um
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
large capital work that will will
 
00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
large capital work that will will
require

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
um the delay of one to two years in
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
have enough revenue coming in to fund
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
that work so
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
um that is a turnpike uh if there's any
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
any questions we can take them now in
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
now certainly you know if there are any
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
questions that come up in the future
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to answer them at a later
 
00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:43.510 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to answer them at a later
time

00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
all right if there are any questions
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
i'll move on to that
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
question excuse me representative heath
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and thank you
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
i remember when we did the last budget
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
cycle um
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of concerns i see here
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
you you've targeted um
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
operations maintenance depth service um
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of concerns about your
 
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:11.910 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of concerns about your
equipment

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
on the highway um i'm sorry on the
 
00:55:14.559 --> 00:55:15.750 align:start position:0%
on the highway um i'm sorry on the
turnpike

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
turnpike
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
does that continue or has um
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
that been addressed so on the turnpike
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
side the equipment
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
has always been funded at um
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
a reasonable level to to meet whatever
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
requirements the turnpike system needed
 
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's on the highway side that we have
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
issues on equipment
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
and i'll talk about that uh later on
 
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i always get them confused
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead chris
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm also going to turn it over to uh to
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
marina talk about the highway fund
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
good morning uh madam chairman and the
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to talk to you and get into
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
just as a general overview the highway
 
00:56:07.119 --> 00:56:07.910 align:start position:0%
just as a general overview the highway
fund

00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
is not the dot and dot is not the
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
highway fund there is some misnomer that
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
we control the highway fund which we do
 
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:15.990 align:start position:0%
we control the highway fund which we do
not

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
it is the fund which the unrestricted
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
revenue from the gas tax or road toll
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
and registration fees
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
are collected by the department of
 
00:56:23.839 --> 00:56:26.150 align:start position:0%
are collected by the department of
safety

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's also the fund where our federal
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
construction program
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
our garvey bonds and tifio proceeds are
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
collected and go through here so that's
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
why you'll see
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
that municipal construction aid and
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
construction blue
 
00:56:42.789 --> 00:56:42.799 align:start position:0%
section that includes all of our federal
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
construction reimbursements and the in
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
any of these bonds and tifia proceeds
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's the primary source for our
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
highway fund revenue from the highway
 
00:56:56.309 --> 00:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
fund is appropriated to
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
various agencies so not only does dot
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
have get
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
money to use from the highway fund but
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
the but
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
safety the judicial branch and justice
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
also received funds from the highway
 
00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.589 align:start position:0%
also received funds from the highway
fund

00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2020 the actual
 
00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.230 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2020 the actual
expenditures

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
when we break it down about 59 of the
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
was appropriated to d.o.t or was
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
expensed by dot
 
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
26 percent to other agencies so that
 
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:29.670 align:start position:0%
26 percent to other agencies so that
includes

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
safety um and justice and 15
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
to municipalities so that's primarily
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
that 15 is the block grant
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
block grant aid distribution that by law
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
12 of the gross revenue that's received
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
is distributed to cities and towns
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
so and that 15 percent gets added to
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
dot's percentage when you see the budget
 
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:59.109 align:start position:0%
dot's percentage when you see the budget
breakdown

00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
for the i know some of you may be
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
rsa 99b this is the requirement that the
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
um not less than 73
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
is dedicated to dot dos not more than 26
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
and other fund and other agencies not
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
more than one percent
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
so um in the 2223 biennium
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
um it it looks like the the
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
rsa99b is met i'm not sure if it if it
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
needs to be in hb2 if it needs to be
 
00:58:35.359 --> 00:58:35.990 align:start position:0%
needs to be in hb2 if it needs to be
suspended

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
in prior years it had there has been a
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
requirement for it to be suspended
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
because those percentages were not met
 
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:43.900 align:start position:0%
because those percentages were not met
um

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:43.910 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:45.030 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
mickey will obviously um verify the
 
00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.589 align:start position:0%
mickey will obviously um verify the
percentages

00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh my rough estimates based on what the
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
governor presented
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
was about 75 percent point three percent
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
will be d
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
is dot for the ben biennium safety is 24
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
and other agencies is 0.7 so
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
it appears that we're um meeting that
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
requirement for rsa 99b
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
um just but depending on changes that
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
are made
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
that um provision in the law
 
00:59:19.829 --> 00:59:19.839 align:start position:0%
um has been suspended in the past and
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
so next just an overview on
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
so many of you are probably aware the
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
over time has had several one-time
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
fixes the revenue has been declining in
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
the highway fund you can see
 
00:59:50.789 --> 00:59:50.799 align:start position:0%
it was here at almost a 340 40 million
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
and now we're you know it's down to
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
about 250 to
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
254 million projected in the next budget
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
there were several one-time fixes if you
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
want to call them
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
to try to balance the highway fund over
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
the years
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
the first was this 30
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
registration surcharge back in 2010 and
 
01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.270 align:start position:0%
registration surcharge back in 2010 and
2011.

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
2011.
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
that was uh repealed after 2011
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
so that was only a temporary two-year
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
revenue for that during that same period
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
um you know this was back in the
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
recession of 2009
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
2010 um where we had
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know significant decreases in
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
revenue and we also had a deficit
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
um of 50 million dollars in the highway
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
fund so
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
um we've had to so some of
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
these one-time fixes were done so one of
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
them is
 
01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
this retro turnpike toll credit
 
01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
the department was able to go back on
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
projects and
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
let me just clarify our federal program
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
requires a match so we have um generally
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
um it's an 80 federal funds
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
20 required state match the state
 
01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
does not provide state
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
highway funds to match the federal
 
01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.150 align:start position:0%
highway funds to match the federal
program

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
so therefore we use toll credits from
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
to match that program so in essence it
 
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:26.870 align:start position:0%
to match that program so in essence it
makes

01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
makes
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
all of our projects 100 percent
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't increase the pot of money
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
we get from the feds or anything like
 
01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.270 align:start position:0%
we get from the feds or anything like
that

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
it just makes all of our projects 100
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
percent federally funded
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
so um during that time frame back in
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
2010 11
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
12 we there was a look-back provision so
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
we went back to some projects that we
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
had used state funds to match and we
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
went back and we did we retroactively
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
took toll credits
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
to bring back that revenue into the
 
01:01:59.119 --> 01:02:00.789 align:start position:0%
to bring back that revenue into the
state

01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
the next the next item down here was the
 
01:02:03.839 --> 01:02:05.029 align:start position:0%
the next the next item down here was the
i-95

01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
i-95
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
bridge sale so at one time the highway
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
owned that the i-95
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
bridge between maine and new hampshire
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
and that was sold to the turnpike system
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
to raise revenue for for the highway
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
fund it also made sense
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
um from a maintenance and operations
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
perspective because
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
there was a very small portion that was
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
highway and the
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
everything around it was all turnpike so
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
it did it did make sense but that sale
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
was for 120 million dollars it was
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
supposed to be paid off over a 20-year
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
period but because of the issues in the
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
it was paid off over a six-year period
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
so you can see
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
um once the the payment of that note was
 
01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:51.750 align:start position:0%
um once the the payment of that note was
made

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's no more revenue coming into the
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
highway fund for that
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
um and then we have some miscellaneous
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
up here
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
um at one time our federal revenue
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
related to our overhead that we collect
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
on the federal program
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
was going into unrestricted that was
 
01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.190 align:start position:0%
was going into unrestricted that was
changed

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
and is now restricted and it covers
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
our operating expenditures for our
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
highway design
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
in several other areas some of our
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
bridge maintenance and traffic
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
areas that were previously
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
where we used highway funds unrestricted
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
highway funds for that so those have now
 
01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
highway funds for that so those have now
been

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
those federal funds are now restricted
 
01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.190 align:start position:0%
those federal funds are now restricted
and

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
cover a portion of our salaries and
 
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
um some other one-time revenue fixes
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
that you don't see here because they
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
um are have been restricted
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal year 16 and 17
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
um 8.3 million from the
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
sb 367 which was the 4.2 cent
 
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
gas road toll increase in 2014
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
prior to us finalizing the tiffy alone
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
8.3 million of that revenue
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
was dedicated to highway operations that
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
year to help balance the highway fund
 
01:04:20.549 --> 01:04:20.559 align:start position:0%
so that was about 16 million over that
 
01:04:20.559 --> 01:04:22.390 align:start position:0%
so that was about 16 million over that
biennium

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
in fy 17 13.9 million was transferred
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
from the general fund
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund to balance it for
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
that biennium
 
01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
for the um eight fiscal year 18 and 19
 
01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
for the um eight fiscal year 18 and 19
biennium

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
and then in fiscal year 20 for this
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
biennium four million dollars was
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
transferred for the from the general
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
fund to balance
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
the fy 2021 budget
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
and then currently in the fy 22
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
23 mostly in fi 22 we have the 41
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars from
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
the relief fund um that is assisting
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
um because of the lost revenue um and
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
there's also the 8.1 million
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
transfer from the general fund so as you
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
can see
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
over time we've had reduced revenue
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
we've had several one-time fixes that
 
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.829 align:start position:0%
we've had several one-time fixes that
keeps

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
keeps
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
kind of kicking the can kicking this
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
problem down the road we've been lucky
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to have
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
the general fund transfers and these
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
other things to help
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
balance the budget but you've seen from
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know the other slides with our
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
positions though because of these
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
reductions you know we've had
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
significant decreases in positions
 
01:05:34.319 --> 01:05:35.109 align:start position:0%
significant decreases in positions
almost

01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
you know almost 200 positions um back in
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see in some of the other
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
issues as
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner goes through later
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
with our equipment we've had you know
 
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:47.029 align:start position:0%
with our equipment we've had you know
having

01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
fur the maintenance on our equipment and
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
those type of things
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
representative petry you have a question
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and my all button works
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
right thanks for taking the question
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
is 93 coming in on budget and uh
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
the way we financed i believe
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh it was kind of unique could uh you
 
01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
explain how that's going to work and
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes i-93 was um
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
the current budget was around 800
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
million and yes we're coming in under
 
01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.430 align:start position:0%
million and yes we're coming in under
budget

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
um for the benefit of the new members to
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
chris mentioned earlier both garvey as
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
well as tiffia
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
garvey is grant anticipation revenue
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles in other words
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
a federal bond that is backed by future
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
federal apportionment and tiffia
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
is the transportation infrastructure
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
finance innovation act
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
and that's actually a loan that was
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
backed by
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
the gas tax increase that was passed
 
01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.029 align:start position:0%
the gas tax increase that was passed
that

01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
re-referenced in sb 367
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
um so i'll let marie talk a little bit
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
more about the actual
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
funding for 93 but i just wanted to make
 
01:07:08.069 --> 01:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
sure you understood that
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
that project was funded with both
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
federal bonds
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
as well as a federal loan the federal
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
bonds we pay the debt service with
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
future federal
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
highway dollars and then the loan we pay
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the state revenues coming in
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
through sb
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
367 the road toll or gas tax increase
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
so marie do you want to talk about the
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
the budget itself
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so for um for so for the tiffy
 
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:35.190 align:start position:0%
yeah so for um for so for the tiffy
alone

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
alone
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
um we were able to defer principal
 
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:39.270 align:start position:0%
um we were able to defer principal
payments

01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
for nine years so we were able to defer
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
it while the project was in construction
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then an additional
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
five years so what we're doing right now
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
um is with that deferment of the
 
01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.829 align:start position:0%
um is with that deferment of the
principal

01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
principal
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
the the revenue coming in is being put
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
towards road paving and bridges
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance in the rural parts of the
 
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.069 align:start position:0%
maintenance in the rural parts of the
state

01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
so we're putting about 10 to 12 million
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
towards paving and another eight million
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
towards uh bridge prop red list bridges
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
um once that we have to start paying
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
back the principal
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
which is in uh 20 2025
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
um then the paving
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
and the bridge work will not be we will
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
not be able to continue to do that
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
because those funds will be going
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
i give my good go oh i'm on mute so yes
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
you're good to go
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you um any no
 
01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
any uh information or knowledge or
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
insight coming from ways and means
 
01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:08.229 align:start position:0%
insight coming from ways and means
around

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
i believe safety has presented to them
 
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:17.910 align:start position:0%
i believe safety has presented to them
and

01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
as well as the governor's office on
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
their projections
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
so what you see in this slide
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
is what the governor has projected for
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
for road toll and motor vehicle fees
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
so these are these are the projections
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
here the
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
um you know about 252 million 254
 
01:09:40.799 --> 01:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
um you know about 252 million 254
million

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
and i think that is still a decline much
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
like we showed you with the turnpike
 
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.430 align:start position:0%
like we showed you with the turnpike
system

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
there is still a decline there as
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's an anticipation that folks are
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
continue to you know there'll be some
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
remote work telehealth all those other
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
um items the commissioner had brought up
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
so they don't quite get back to
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
um the levels that we were at before
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
um covid but i think they're but they're
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
gradually increasing
 
01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
um each year so there hasn't been any
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
particular talk about
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
um how one might increase
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
revenues these are just the predictions
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
for now but any discussion about what
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
what they might be able to do
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
marie touched on some of the things that
 
01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
are in the governor's budget
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
so she mentioned there's been a transfer
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
of general funds
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund that's associated
 
01:10:36.719 --> 01:10:37.350 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund that's associated
with

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
um when there was one time general fund
 
01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.990 align:start position:0%
um when there was one time general fund
surplus

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
surplus
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
hb 1817 provided general fund
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
revenue to the dot for the completion of
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
some bridge projects
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
we had one project left to complete by
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
using those hb
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
18 17 we were able to switch the funding
 
01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
to federal funds
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining 8 million has
 
01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining 8 million has
been

01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
put into the highway fund as part of
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
balancing the budget
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
in the governor's phase and so
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
the budget that you have been provided
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
is a balanced budget
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about our additional needs
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
but overall
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
while the highway fund revenue has been
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
flat in prior biennium and then was
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
certainly impacted by covid
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
um other sources of revenue have been
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
introduced to fund some of our
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
activities plus we talked about it
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
earlier we did receive that 41 million
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
in federal relief um that we have also
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
used to fund some of our operations so
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
typically federal highway dollars cannot
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:51.670 align:start position:0%
but on this occasion it was 41 million
 
01:11:51.670 --> 01:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
but on this occasion it was 41 million
[Music]

01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
with full flexibility and so that also
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
has taken the pressures off
 
01:11:59.430 --> 01:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
but later on we'll show you what we can
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
and can't accomplish with this budget
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
but between the federal funds and the
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
everything is currently balanced despite
 
01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
the challenges
 
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i i'm very empathetic to our own
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
state legislature
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
um the fast act the federal
 
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.669 align:start position:0%
um the fast act the federal
authorization

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
transportation expires in
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
september it actually expired in
 
01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:21.990 align:start position:0%
september it actually expired in
september

01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
september
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
of 2020 but congress passed a one-year
 
01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
of 2020 but congress passed a one-year
extension

01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
extension
 
01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
and also added funding into the highway
 
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
trust fund to make sure they could
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
fund all the commitments in that
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
one-year extension
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
congress will be debating how to fund
 
01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.310 align:start position:0%
congress will be debating how to fund
reauthorization

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
reauthorization
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
and they're seeing the same thing at the
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
federal level you know as fuel
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency increases
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
um revenues are declining through
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
traditional sources and then further
 
01:12:54.149 --> 01:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
with over 19 and more limited travel
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
there has been a reduction in gas tax
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
receipts as well
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
so i know that the new hampshire
 
01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.510 align:start position:0%
so i know that the new hampshire
legislature

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
needs to understand how congress is
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to fund transportation to the
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
future to then understand what the gap
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
might be and what steps you might want
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
to take
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
but we're hopeful that through
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
reauthorization given
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and everything that it is
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
meant for transportation
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
that will be provided some more
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility as well as some additional
 
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.149 align:start position:0%
flexibility as well as some additional
dollars

01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
and i can appreciate our legislature
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
wanting to
 
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
to wait and see what money is provided
 
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to say so now i'll touch
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
highway fund budget um so beginning
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
um so the department was required
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
um to have a funding reduction of seven
 
01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.790 align:start position:0%
um to have a funding reduction of seven
percent

01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
agency phase for fy22 and then
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
one percent increase to fy23 from the fy
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
22 level
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so as part of our reductions
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh we had to reduce our fleet equipment
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
we reduced that by
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
more than six million dollars a year uh
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
we had reduced our preventative
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance so
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately these were programs put
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
into the budget
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
new programs put into the budget um last
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
time in 2021
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
but with covid and you know
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
our need to try to conserve highway
 
01:14:40.719 --> 01:14:41.830 align:start position:0%
our need to try to conserve highway
funds

01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
we did not move forward with these new
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
programs and therefore they were all
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
they have also been reduced
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the 2223 budget that includes our
 
01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:50.390 align:start position:0%
in the 2223 budget that includes our
bridgewat

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
bridgewat
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
bridge washing of about 1.7 million
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
guard rail repairs of about a million
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
tree trimming and brush clearing of a
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
little over a million
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
and then graffiti removal of about 200
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
000 a year
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
we also reduced temporary positions
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
over time etcetera you know engineering
 
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh marie representative petry has a
 
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:21.669 align:start position:0%
uh marie representative petry has a
question

01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:21.679 --> 01:15:24.950 align:start position:0%
question
okay

01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
ah let's see am i going here when
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
where'd it go
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay all right uh the
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
ques the question is
 
01:15:36.630 --> 01:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh i got a call from uh pittsburgh area
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
and uh a citizen was concerned that uh
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
i guess one of the maintenance people
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
had a two-wheel drive vehicle
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
and up in the north country that uh
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
could you explain that please
 
01:15:51.189 --> 01:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
are we short with that short of money we
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
and i guess he asked the question
 
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
why he had and they said it was enough
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
money to buy a four wheel drive vehicle
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative petrie if you don't mind
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
can we defer that question and we have a
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
slide and we're going to talk about
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
the fleet in more detail in a couple of
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
minutes okay very good
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you let's circle back to that when
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
we get to that part of our presentation
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.189 --> 01:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
um and so then as the commissioner and
 
01:16:21.199 --> 01:16:21.669 align:start position:0%
um and so then as the commissioner and
chris

01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
chris
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
had um discussed before uh we received
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
41 million dollars in federal funding
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
um as part of the coronavirus response
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
and relief supplemental appropriation
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
act and this was used to displace
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
highway fund expenditures in fy
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
22. and then as was just discussed
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
earlier as well
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
for that one bridge project we do 8.1
 
01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:50.630 align:start position:0%
for that one bridge project we do 8.1
million

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
of unspent appropriations um
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
is being uh lapsed and will be
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
transferred to the highway fund
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
um to manage this budget
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so additional needs that were funded
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
by the governor's office so we had some
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
um some areas
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
where that were short that we needed
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
funds for
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
so debt service was one of them
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
obviously we have prior
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
capital projects that have been approved
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
in hb 25
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
um so we needed to um be able to pay
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
debt service
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
on those prior commitments um so we got
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
about a three million dollar
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
increase from our additional leads by
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
the governor's office
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then um block grant um
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
had not been sufficiently funded based
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
on the revenue projections
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
so blocking it was also funded
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
appropriately appropriately based on
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
the revenue projections coming out of
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and safety
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
um we did one bit of good news
 
01:17:57.430 --> 01:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
we did have uh 12 million dollars over
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
for our winter maintenance um so this
 
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:01.750 align:start position:0%
for our winter maintenance um so this
funds

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
dot's winter maintenance at a three-year
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
average um
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
so as many of you remember in the past
 
01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:08.790 align:start position:0%
so as many of you remember in the past
um

01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know we weren't even funded at a
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
three-year average and annually we would
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
come to the fiscal committee
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
um and need to request um additional
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
um buy salt rent rent the equipment and
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
contractors and provide overtime to
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
folks so
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
this this um budget now funds it
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
at the three year average um it doesn't
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
mean we may never have to come back to
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee again
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
but at least we're funded at a at a more
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate level
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
and only in extreme winters will we need
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
to come back and potentially ask for
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
other some other smaller items that were
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
funded by the governor's office that
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
were additional needs
 
01:18:53.669 --> 01:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
was related to doit
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
and that was for office 365
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
transfer to general services for
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
building maintenance to maintain
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the buildings here at dot transfer
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
to justice for
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
the ag's support of dot
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
and then the project development
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
engineering intern program was funded
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
at about four hundred thousand dollars
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the biennium so those were the
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
additional needs funded um during the
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we still have some additional
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
some other additional needs that were
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
not funded
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
the first is what we've been discussing
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
already is our fleet so we have about
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
6.4 million
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
per year 12.8 million over the biennium
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
um of an increase to to fund our
 
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
fleet equipment so that we can be at our
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
recommended replacement criteria
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
and chris uh we'll be going through that
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
um detailed information
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
to kind of show um that
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
the status of our fleet the wreck in the
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
recommended replacement criteria and how
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
far we're behind
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
in replacing our equipment we also
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
have some needs for bridge maintenance
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
in our traffic bureaus
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
for equipment with the deferred
 
01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.390 align:start position:0%
for equipment with the deferred
purchases

01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
purchases
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
um you know due to the coven reductions
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
these are important items that those
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
bureaus need to be able to continue to
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
do their work
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
and because we had to lapse those funds
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
in fy 20 some of those funds
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know they're behind again in their
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
some of their equipment purchases and
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know having to defer those items
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
related to the covid pandemic
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh preventative maintenance so um there
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
there these programs that we had to cut
 
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.110 align:start position:0%
there these programs that we had to cut
that

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
as based you know based on the revenue
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
reductions we had in the governor's
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
agency phase
 
01:20:58.470 --> 01:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
not the governor's the agency phase of
 
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
the budget sorry
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
so we still have we're still requesting
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
these additional needs we do believe
 
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.550 align:start position:0%
these additional needs we do believe
that

01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
the guard rail maintenance and repairs
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
are extremely important
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's a safety issue and federal funds
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for maintenance and
 
01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.790 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for maintenance and
repairs

01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
repairs
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
in this area so we do have some federal
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
funds that we
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
when we're putting in new guard rail in
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
a project but we cannot
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
maintain and repair guard rail that may
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
be damaged with
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds so we we do have these
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
funds that we need and then there's the
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
bridge washing program
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
again um federal funds aren't you can't
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
use federal funds for
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance so the bridge washing
 
01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.629 align:start position:0%
maintenance so the bridge washing
program

01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
removes the salt and elements that
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
damage the bridge bridges
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
and it would allow um you know the
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
washing of the expensive more expensive
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
and larger tier one bridges annually
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
and to be able to do that preventative
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance and
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
hope and make the life of those bridges
 
01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:00.950 align:start position:0%
hope and make the life of those bridges
last

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
a bit longer we have our
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
telematics devices equipment and
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
software for mechanical services
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
about 0.7 million over the biennium um
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
these are um two i you know these are
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
the telematics devices for
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
all the fleet equipment to be able to
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
monitor um
 
01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
efficiencies for fuel and maintenance
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
location and that type of thing
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
you know we do believe that having these
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
the telematics will provide savings to
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
um and something that we've had in our
 
01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
budget now for several bienniums
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
but just it just hasn't been a priority
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
to get funded
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
the the next item are the its devices
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
repairs and maintenance and consultants
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
for our tismo bureau that's our
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
transportation systems and management
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
operations so those are the folks that
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
had um
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
monitor the traffic on all the highways
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
they have the
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
the cameras and the and the monitors to
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
regulate the traffic and know when their
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
accidents and be able to just
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know dispatch help
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
past years we've had a significant
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of devices
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
so federal projects allow you to buy the
 
01:23:20.239 --> 01:23:20.870 align:start position:0%
so federal projects allow you to buy the
devices

01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
and put them in to the corridors all
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
along i-93
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
turnpikes going up north 89 but as we're
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
increasing those devices
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
you know we had based on the tight
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
budgets we've had we haven't been able
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
to increase the the maintenance and
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
repair of those devices well some of
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
those now are getting old
 
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
they're starting to break more
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
frequently and so we need these
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
additional funds
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain and repair um
 
01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:50.149 align:start position:0%
to be able to maintain and repair um
again

01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
just like the fleet you know we be able
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
to maintain and repair the the equipment
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
that we've put in our system
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and then we have the graffiti removal
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we identified that we had moved out
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
of the budget as well that's about 400
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
000 over the biennium
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and then the last item is um
 
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
some of you may be aware some may not um
 
01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:15.189 align:start position:0%
some of you may be aware some may not um
it's

01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
um so fhwa law has a 10
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
20 year rule um so basically
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
um it's 10 years for engineering 20
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
years for right-of-way so
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
when you start a project and you spend
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
money in engineering
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
you have up to 10 years to move to the
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
right-of-way acquisition
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
or to construction and once you go to
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
right-of-way then you have it in
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
20 years before to get to construction
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
so the conway bypass project has not
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
gone to construction
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
um it was re the layout was recently
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
dissolved at gnc
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
um and the project's not part of the
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
10-year plan anymore
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
so because of that law fhwa has we have
 
01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.229 align:start position:0%
so because of that law fhwa has we have
spent

01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
money on primarily the right-of-way and
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
acquisition of property
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
that will not be used for the conway
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
bypass so therefore we have to pay back
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
federal highway those funds
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
so this two million dollars per year
 
01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.629 align:start position:0%
so this two million dollars per year
payback

01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
payback
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
um we have reserved some money for the
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
payback but we are still in need of
 
01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.310 align:start position:0%
payback but we are still in need of
approximately

01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
six to eight million dollars um of
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to pay back what
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
we think they're going to ask us for so
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
um this two million dollars per year of
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
additional needs
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
is to help um continue to put
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
funds aside to be able to pay back the
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
conway project
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on that or
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh marie yes this representative
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
berger i would like to ask you to give
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
me a call
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can have a longer discussion
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
01:26:01.110 --> 01:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
conway bypass because it's obviously
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know that it's right here in my
 
01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.310 align:start position:0%
you know that it's right here in my
backyard

01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
so i just i know that i knew that this
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
was coming i just need to
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
have a fuller understanding of uh
 
01:26:16.149 --> 01:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
of what's going on so okay
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions if
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
not i'll turn it over to the
 
01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:29.590 align:start position:0%
not i'll turn it over to the
commissioner

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
so as you've heard um several times this
 
01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
so as you've heard um several times this
morning

01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
long term we are still concerned about
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
the health of the highway fund
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
and um the structural issues
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
but fortunately we did receive the
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
federal relief dollars and we're
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
optimistic that we'll get some
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
additional flexibility through
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
future federal actions um so it appears
 
01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.350 align:start position:0%
future federal actions um so it appears
that

01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
with the cuts that we have made and the
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
work that we are deferring um
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
we can advance with
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
an adequate budget for this year but
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
there will be some of those looming
 
01:27:14.709 --> 01:27:14.719 align:start position:0%
liabilities that we've discussed in the
 
01:27:14.719 --> 01:27:15.830 align:start position:0%
liabilities that we've discussed in the
past

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
our biggest concern still remains the
 
01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.830 align:start position:0%
our biggest concern still remains the
fleet

01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
fleet
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
for the new committee members and chris
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
will do a deeper dive in a moment
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
but the replacement value of our fleet
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
is around
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
90 million so if trucks last
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
approximately 10 years we should be
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
spending around
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
8 to 9 million annually on vehicles
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
we have not been doing that for many
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
many years and we were
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
supported by the legislature and the
 
01:27:43.910 --> 01:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
governor during the last budget
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
with both capital dollars to play catch
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
up and address our backlog of fleet
 
01:27:48.159 --> 01:27:49.510 align:start position:0%
up and address our backlog of fleet
replacements

01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
replacements
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
as well as a significant increase in our
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
to start to invest at the appropriate
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
level unfortunately
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
and covet hits we did not move forward
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
with all of the purchases
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
as we had planned because of the revenue
 
01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.149 align:start position:0%
as we had planned because of the revenue
uncertainty

01:28:04.149 --> 01:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
uncertainty
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
and now in this budget we're back down
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
to the two to three million dollar per
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
year level
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the eight million dollar
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
level so chris will do the deeper dive
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
but that's still our biggest concern
 
01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.310 align:start position:0%
but that's still our biggest concern
overall

01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
um but if there was some one-time
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
federal relief money provided to the
 
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
federal relief money provided to the
state

01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
we would hope that we could use some of
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
that for fleet purchases
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
but of course it's too early to tell
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
what types of
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
stimulus or relief dollars may be
 
01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.189 align:start position:0%
stimulus or relief dollars may be
provided

01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:28:35.110 --> 01:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
and then as marie outlined is all of
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
these preventative maintenance items you
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
know whether it's keeping up with
 
01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.430 align:start position:0%
know whether it's keeping up with
guardrail

01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
guardrail
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
the graffiti removal these are things
 
01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:43.910 align:start position:0%
the graffiti removal these are things
that

01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
we just unable to complete with our
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
current resources we're focused
 
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
on the assets that have the most value
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to maintain those and
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately things like bridge washing
 
01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know we're washing bridges every
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
other year
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
ideally we'd wash them annually but we
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
have to stretch the resources and do a
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
little bit of everything
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
with the budget that we have and then
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
the other challenge that's ongoing
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
especially in winter months
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
is in the southern sections of the state
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
as well as along the borders with
 
01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
neighboring states there's a lot more
 
01:29:19.199 --> 01:29:20.149 align:start position:0%
neighboring states there's a lot more
competition

01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
competition
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
for contractors so for winter
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance in particular
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
we are struggling at times to find
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
adequate contractors to complement
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
our dot staff if we have a mild winter
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
we don't use the contractors to the same
 
01:29:36.719 --> 01:29:37.189 align:start position:0%
we don't use the contractors to the same
degree

01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
degree
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that's why we manage our programs
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
in the higher elevations and the
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
northern parts of the state where we get
 
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
a lot more snowfall year to year
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
we have more of our own forces plowing
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
and treating the roadways
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
in the southern sections of the state we
 
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
rely more heavily on contractors so that
 
01:29:59.350 --> 01:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the years when we have a mild winter
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
we're not incurring the costs of having
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
a large team
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
who aren't needed 100 of the time but
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
the downside is
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know we we need to be able to
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
attract and retain
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
those contractors to work alongside our
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
folks so that's still a concern
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead okay uh commissioner
 
01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:20.870 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead okay uh commissioner
obviously

01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
any money that was authorized in the
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh package that passed in
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh december has not been accounted for
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
in your budget is that correct
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
it was not accounted for in our agency
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
phase but the governor included those
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
dollars in our budget
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
and so there was activities that would
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
typically be funded
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
with highway fund revenue
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
and we're counting on that federal
 
01:30:48.719 --> 01:30:50.070 align:start position:0%
and we're counting on that federal
revenue

01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
to fund some of those aspects that's why
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
our draw on the highway fund is lower
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
in the first year of the biennium okay
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
so you he
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
in the governor's phase he has guessed
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
about how much
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
the um the latest act
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
the one that was passed in uh december
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's the 41 million marie can you go
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
back through the slides to the
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
um the bar chart that chris talked about
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay i i got the 41 million
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to show you how the
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
stacks look um
 
01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
um so you'll see in our agency phase
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
we were anticipating a draw of
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
216 million approximately on the highway
 
01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.070 align:start position:0%
216 million approximately on the highway
fund

01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
when we received the 41 million in
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
relief dollars
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
our draw on the highway fund has been
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
reduced to 182 million
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
while our federal funding has been
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
increased from
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
207 to 248.5 so that's where the 41
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
would have play highway funded to
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
federally funded
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand was the 41
 
01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:03.910 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand was the 41
million

01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
based on the first cares act
 
01:32:09.669 --> 01:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
no the the first cares act provided
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
nothing for
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
highways it was only support for
 
01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:14.870 align:start position:0%
highways it was only support for
airports

01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
airports
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
and public transportation it was a bill
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
that was passed in december
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that has a much less
 
01:32:27.189 --> 01:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
friendly acronym um bill that provided
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
the 41
 
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
41 million so in the agency phase we did
 
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:31.430 align:start position:0%
41 million so in the agency phase we did
not

01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
know that money was coming whereas now
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're in the governor's phase
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
um that 41 million was provided for
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
state dots
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
so that's how we were able to govern his
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
office and switch things out from
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
highway funded to federally funded
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
okay so all right thank you very much
 
01:32:48.159 --> 01:32:49.350 align:start position:0%
okay so all right thank you very much
and

01:32:49.350 --> 01:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens i appreciate that
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
so that revenue is that federal funding
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
is certain that was provided in december
 
01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
those dollars are are coming to the
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
just so you know page 876
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
of the governor's budget is the county
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's the county unit 3007 it's our
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
highway maintenance bureau
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
and that's where you can see the 41
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
million of federal funds
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
has been appropriated and you can see
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
how it
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
that change um in the
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
41 million of federal funds all right
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you marie i
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that i've i've just been
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
confused about
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
which money we were talking about
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
and i thank you you're welcome
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
and so the other item that was touched
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
on is you know in the short term
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
um we're taking the
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
revenue from sb 367 which was
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
the road toll or gas tax increase um and
 
01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:04.390 align:start position:0%
the road toll or gas tax increase um and
we

01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
are paying interest only on
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
the tiffy alone that was the loan for
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
i-93 the representative petrie asked
 
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.110 align:start position:0%
i-93 the representative petrie asked
about

01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
but eventually as marie explained we
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
start to pay the principal then we will
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
have less
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
capacity to do work on rural
 
01:34:26.229 --> 01:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
roads and bridges many of
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
the sections of roadway that we're
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
paving with this revenue that's
 
01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.430 align:start position:0%
paving with this revenue that's
available

01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
in the near term these are roads that
 
01:34:35.189 --> 01:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
are not typically eligible for federal
 
01:34:35.199 --> 01:34:36.149 align:start position:0%
are not typically eligible for federal
funds

01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
um and part of the reason we secured the
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
loan and got such a
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
low rate was because we pledged to
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
stretch the value
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
of sb 367 and do the work
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
in these regions of the state where the
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
condition of the infrastructure really
 
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:50.709 align:start position:0%
condition of the infrastructure really
warranted

01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
warranted
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
more investment so we were very
 
01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:54.629 align:start position:0%
more investment so we were very
fortunate

01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
fortunate
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
because of this program and because of
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature passing this bill
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing some of the best road
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
and bridge condition that we have
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
in a long long time but we just have
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
that concern
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
that once we start to pay principal on
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
the loan
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
then the condition will deteriorate
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
again because we just don't have the
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
capacity this is something we also are
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
advocating for at the federal level
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
for additional investment and more
 
01:35:19.199 --> 01:35:21.030 align:start position:0%
for additional investment and more
flexibility

01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
to do some work on the what they call
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
the off system the non-federal aid
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
eligible system
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
that will need to be addressed at some
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
point i do have a question
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh did 367 have
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
a time timeline
 
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
on it or is that did
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes when the um the loan for i-93 is
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
paid off
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
then the increase in the road toll or
 
01:35:53.669 --> 01:35:53.679 align:start position:0%
gas tax sunsets
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
okay and what when are we projecting
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
that i'm sorry i know somebody said it
 
01:35:59.189 --> 01:35:59.199 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
20 34 isn't that correct me that's great
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so this ties into this next bullet
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
item which is the limited state funding
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
for non-fed eligible
 
01:36:15.109 --> 01:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
roads and so
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that we ended up in
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
where we wanted to invest more is
 
01:36:20.719 --> 01:36:23.270 align:start position:0%
where we wanted to invest more is
because

01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
hundred and forty miles of our roadway
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
network that is state-owned is not
 
01:36:28.239 --> 01:36:29.109 align:start position:0%
network that is state-owned is not
eligible

01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
for federal dollars um so sb 367 has
 
01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.790 align:start position:0%
for federal dollars um so sb 367 has
really

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
given us a lot of flexibility and with
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
the additional revenue we're paving
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
around 1800 miles in total
 
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
over the duration of the program
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
but longer term this is something
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to uh
 
01:36:54.870 --> 01:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
sneak up on the legislature that you'd
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
have time to take action
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and prepare accordingly other items
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
on this slide we've also touched on
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
previously today um
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned our current vacancy
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
rate is around 15
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
that is our vacancy rate department wide
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
the timing of
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh covet 19 meant that some bureaus were
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacted
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
for example we often hold some of our
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
vacancies in highway design
 
01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
um so that we can recruit from recent
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
college graduates
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
in the um the springtime and of course
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
the hiring phase was implemented in
 
01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.149 align:start position:0%
the hiring phase was implemented in
march

01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
march
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so at one point our vacancy rate in
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
highway design was around 25 to 26
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
um with the hiring freeze now being
 
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
lifted and the governor's
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
22-23 budget um being finalized
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're starting to work to to backfill
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
some of those vacancies
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
other bureaus that were significantly
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
impacted um
 
01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
support both our project development
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
activities as well as other areas of dot
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
so for example in the bureau of
 
01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.070 align:start position:0%
so for example in the bureau of
right-of-way

01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
right-of-way
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
certain work units and i've seen a 50
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
um and then our office of federal
 
01:38:06.239 --> 01:38:07.189 align:start position:0%
um and then our office of federal
compliance

01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
um they have seen vacancy rates in
 
01:38:12.070 --> 01:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
excess of 60
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
so some of our very small bureaus um if
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
we only had you know
 
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
12 or 15 positions and circumstances
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
were such that we had a lot of vacancies
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
um they have really been struggling to
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
keep up during this time
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
but the good news is and now that the
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze is lifted we're actively
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
working to recruit
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
but it will take us some time to catch
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
up a lot of the work that was deferred
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
just to limited resources um
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
other items up here at transit funding
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know we touched on it
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
typically the state does not provide a
 
01:38:48.629 --> 01:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
lot of assistance to match federal
 
01:38:48.639 --> 01:38:49.590 align:start position:0%
lot of assistance to match federal
dollars

01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
in the short term this is not a
 
01:38:53.109 --> 01:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
challenge because at least on the
 
01:38:54.629 --> 01:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
operating side
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
we can use the cares act federal funds
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
at 100
 
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
um but beyond this biennium that will
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
continue to be a challenge making sure
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
matching dollars to access federal
 
01:39:06.639 --> 01:39:08.310 align:start position:0%
matching dollars to access federal
programs

01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:39:11.669 --> 01:39:11.679 align:start position:0%
and then the last two items retouched on
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
this the state match for the federal
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
highway program
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
and she explained the toll credit
 
01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.070 align:start position:0%
and she explained the toll credit
program

01:39:18.070 --> 01:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and so basically uh the turnpike system
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
to explain how we actually accrue total
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
credits in the first place
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
because the turnpike system predates the
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
federal highway
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry the federal aid system and the
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
national highway system
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
um we have always collected our own
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
revenue to take care of those assets
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
we typically don't draw on federal funds
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
to maintain
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
the turnpike but those are
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
high volume roadways of critical
 
01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
importance to
 
01:39:50.950 --> 01:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
the movement of goods and people and so
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
every time we invest in our turnpike
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
system we
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
accrue credits with the federal
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
government now this is not cash
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's purely a credit and so marie
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
explained how we
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
leverage those credits to access federal
 
01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:05.990 align:start position:0%
leverage those credits to access federal
funds

01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
and so for every keeping it in simple
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
terms you know for every eighty dollars
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
the federal government gives us
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
typically you bring twenty dollars of
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
cash match to the table
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
and you spend a hundred dollars and what
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
we do in new hampshire
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
is we spend the eighty dollars
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
and match it with twenty dollars of toll
 
01:40:25.679 --> 01:40:26.550 align:start position:0%
and match it with twenty dollars of toll
credits

01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
credits
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's not real cash though it's just a
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
credit it's a way of accessing federal
 
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:30.629 align:start position:0%
credit it's a way of accessing federal
money

01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
so we only spend eighty dollars um so
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
this means that our programs are
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
proportionally much smaller
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
than our some of our neighboring states
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
which do
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
bring a cash match to access their
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
beyond that new hampshire also receives
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
the least federal funding of all the
 
01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:48.629 align:start position:0%
the least federal funding of all the
states

01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
where transportation is concerned
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
something that our delegation is always
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
trying to work on and so
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
it means the size of our construction
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
program is smaller
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
than states of similar size with them
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
in some cases they have less lane miles
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
to manage than we do
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
um and so that's one of our challenges
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
the good news is we have very high
 
01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
balances of troll credits
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
so when there's federal grants or at the
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
end of the year when there's federal
 
01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.070 align:start position:0%
end of the year when there's federal
redistribution

01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
redistribution
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that's when they provide access to
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
additional federal dollars that have not
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
been spent
 
01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is in a strong position we
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
don't have to come back to the
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
legislature and ask you for the state
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
match to be able to access those dollars
 
01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:35.199 align:start position:0%
we know we have the toll credits and so
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
any grants that we're awarded
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
or redistribution that we get we can
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
immediately proceed to spend those
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
financial resources um so there are
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
pluses and minuses to the utilization
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
of total credits but overall
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
the one downside is that our program is
 
01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit smaller
 
01:41:56.229 --> 01:41:56.239 align:start position:0%
compared to other states and then the
 
01:41:59.590 --> 01:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
last item is the state a bridge program
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
i receive emails from elected officials
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
all the time talking about municipally
 
01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:07.669 align:start position:0%
all the time talking about municipally
owned

01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
owned
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
bridges that are in poor condition and
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's any state
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
assistance available
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
to help them either rehab or replace
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
that structure
 
01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately all we have available
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
is 6.8 million annually funded through
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
sb 367 to make those bridge improvements
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level
 
01:42:31.590 --> 01:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
and so um that is something that we hear
 
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:32.629 align:start position:0%
and so um that is something that we hear
frequently

01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
is that that program um
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
the the towns are men are struggling to
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
maintain their own infrastructure and
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
they would
 
01:42:41.750 --> 01:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate any additional
 
01:42:45.109 --> 01:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
um madam chair i think someone has their
 
01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if um oh
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative murray did you have a
 
01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:08.310 align:start position:0%
representative murray did you have a
question

01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't know me i think it was
 
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative heath and then
 
01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.550 align:start position:0%
representative heath and then
representative

01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
if that's helpful that's very helpful
 
01:43:21.270 --> 01:43:21.280 align:start position:0%

for um letting me ask a question madam
chair

01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:32.159 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
um and thank you victoria um i want to
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
go back to
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
the free your free fleet under funding
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
now um i just want to make sure i have
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
this correct so
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
in your budget you requested eight
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
um for your fleet um and you were
 
01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
um in the governor's phase you were
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
given two million
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
is that correct no that's not correct
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
um we were given targets in the agency
 
01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:03.669 align:start position:0%
um we were given targets in the agency
phase

01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
phase
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and given the health of the highway
 
01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:06.870 align:start position:0%
yeah and given the health of the highway
fund

01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
the budget that we presented also
 
01:44:09.679 --> 01:44:10.629 align:start position:0%
the budget that we presented also
underfunded

01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
underfunded
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
the investment in the fleet because we
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
felt that there was other higher
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
priorities in terms of
 
01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
investments that we should be making
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
knowing what the revenue outlook for the
 
01:44:24.149 --> 01:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
highway fund was
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
the governor funded us at a similar
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
level to what we requested in our
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
agency budget however we know that's an
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
area of concern and where we should be
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
spending more money
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
but we agreed with the governor that
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
there are other investments that
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
we should be making before we increase
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
the funding for the fleet we wouldn't
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
want to increase the funding for
 
01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.790 align:start position:0%
want to increase the funding for
equipment

01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
and vehicles at the expense of other
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
representative bucco you had a question
 
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you madam chair
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the commissioners for
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
presenting today and
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
marie and kathy and um
 
01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
on page 23 the the pages we were just on
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
you use a rather shocking term here it's
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
called structural insolvency
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
can you explain the effects of that
 
01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:19.189 align:start position:0%
can you explain the effects of that
please

01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:21.430 --> 01:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about the highway fund
 
01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:23.270 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about the highway fund
um

01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:26.629 --> 01:45:26.639 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the fact that there
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
is additional revenue beyond
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
what we're collecting from traditional
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
sources that's necessary to balance the
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
budget so marie showed you the slide
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
where we had the one-time fixes in prior
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
um biennium um this time around
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh we have has been said stated several
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
times you know the 41 million of relief
 
01:45:50.719 --> 01:45:51.350 align:start position:0%
times you know the 41 million of relief
funding

01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
as well as the transfer of the 8 million
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
of general funds to balance the budget
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day you know even
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
before covet we know that people are
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
driving more fuel-efficient vehicles
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore even though they might
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
have been driving more pre-pandemic
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
our revenues were either fairly flat
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
or declining meanwhile the cost of doing
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
business goes up
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
and so this is something that they're
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
grappling with at the federal level
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
and you know will need to be addressed
 
01:46:23.189 --> 01:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
at the state level
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
depending on what happens uh and how
 
01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:27.109 align:start position:0%
depending on what happens uh and how
quickly

01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's wide adoption of electric
 
01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles we're going to continue to see
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
erosion of revenue from traditional
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
sources and that's why there's a lot of
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
conversations about
 
01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
how do we fund transportation into the
 
01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:39.990 align:start position:0%
how do we fund transportation into the
future

01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
but each biennium we're coming up with
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
one-time solutions
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that we have a balanced
 
01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:48.629 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that we have a balanced
budget

01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
and then longer term we still need to
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
find the right solution and something
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
to the legislature but you're not alone
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
the congress is having exactly the same
 
01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.430 align:start position:0%
the congress is having exactly the same
debate

01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
debate
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner we have not
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
made any progress as far as i know
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
on changing the
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
charges uh for using the roads is that
 
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:26.310 align:start position:0%
charges uh for using the roads is that
correct

01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
um correct there's been several bills
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
that have come forward
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
um some of them were specifically
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh requiring electric vehicles to pay
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
more in vehicle registration as a way to
 
01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:40.149 align:start position:0%
more in vehicle registration as a way to
offset

01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
offset
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that they're not contributing
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
with what we call the road tool or are
 
01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
paying gas tax at the state level
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
there's been other bills like
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative major his concept of a
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
road usage fee
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
that didn't just target electric
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles um but targeted
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
all of the vehicles that are higher fuel
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency hybrids as well as
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
um every every make and model on the
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
road today is much more fuel efficient
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
than it was
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 years ago um you know
 
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:10.950 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 years ago um you know
personally

01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
personally
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
i used to drive an old ford explorer
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
that got about 11 12 miles per gallon
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
the models that you can buy today
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
get 25 miles to the gallon sometimes
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
even higher than that depending on the
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
nature of
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
the driving that you do um so it's the
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
the entire fleet that's on the road
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
today is just more fuel efficient
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
than the vehicles that previously were
 
01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:33.990 align:start position:0%
than the vehicles that previously were
contributing

01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that's this is why it's so
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
challenging to think about a long-term
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
source of funding for transportation at
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
the federal level they've been talking
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
about you know tracking
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle miles traveled and it would be a
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
user fee you
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
pay per mile of the system that you
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
utilize and there's a lot of concerns
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
around privacy and how that data would
 
01:48:52.159 --> 01:48:52.870 align:start position:0%
around privacy and how that data would
be

01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
collected and audited and such um
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's why there hasn't been a
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
permanent solution but most
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
of the legislation has been been
 
01:49:02.239 --> 01:49:03.510 align:start position:0%
of the legislation has been been
proposed

01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire has been around a
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
registration surcharge type concept
 
01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:08.470 align:start position:0%
registration surcharge type concept
either

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
targeting electric vehicles or a sliding
 
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.229 align:start position:0%
targeting electric vehicles or a sliding
scale

01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
scale
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
where the registration would increase
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
as the fuel efficiency of your vehicle
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
increases um so you
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's not really looking at increasing
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
the investment the concept being
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
we're asking people to pay what they
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
would have paid before when they drove a
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
last fuel efficient vehicle
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh i don't there's nothing
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
in the legislature this year that i'm
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
aware of or is there
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there's any bills we
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
haven't been asked to provide fiscal
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
notes or
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
testify on any okay i didn't think so
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
um so the last item that we wanted to
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
talk about if there's no further
 
01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:00.229 align:start position:0%
talk about if there's no further
questions

01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:50:02.709 --> 01:50:02.719 align:start position:0%
um is that deeper dive into the fleet
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so at this point i'll turn it back
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
to chris
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
and he'll explain a little bit more
 
01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:07.910 align:start position:0%
and he'll explain a little bit more
detail

01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
detail
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
what the deferred investment in
 
01:50:11.990 --> 01:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
equipment means
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
and this is one of the areas where you
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
know our trucks have to run
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
um we have to plow the roads we need
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
that equipment to perform
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
our critical activities and so it's
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
always my concern
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
that when we don't replace vehicles in
 
01:50:28.709 --> 01:50:28.719 align:start position:0%
the appropriate time frame
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of money mandating them
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
and keeping them
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
road worthy and so in a way we throw
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
good money after bad
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
um and it causes a lot more headaches
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
for our team you know not only is it
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
stressful working long hours
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the winter and trying to keep the
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
roads clear but then when you have
 
01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.629 align:start position:0%
roads clear but then when you have
equipment

01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
um that breaks down and you're trying to
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
get that back
 
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
up and running that's just not only
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
um an expensive way to do things but
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's also extremely
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
burdensome on on the staff whose primary
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
focus is public safety and getting their
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
core work done
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
um so with that i'll let chris walk you
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
through the numbers that we have
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
up on the slide thank you commissioner
 
01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.669 align:start position:0%
up on the slide thank you commissioner
so

01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
this slide and there's a lot of there's
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of information
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
on this slide um i'm going to try to
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
summarize it
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there'll be a lot of
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
questions but each
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of each fiscal year
 
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
mechanical services bureau
 
01:51:32.550 --> 01:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
compiles kind of this uh fleet
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
statistics and it's based
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
as of july 1st 2020 it takes into
 
01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.709 align:start position:0%
as of july 1st 2020 it takes into
account

01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
what currently exists in terms of
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
all the trucks heavy equipment
 
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
passenger vehicles and so on um what
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
stage they're in
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of their life expectancy um and
 
01:51:52.239 --> 01:51:53.030 align:start position:0%
in terms of their life expectancy um and
then

01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:51:55.830 --> 01:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
which ones exceed the parameters that we
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
have in place so for example
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know our heavy trucks uh uh six
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
wheels and ten wheelers
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
um we expect them to last 12 to 15 years
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
light trucks like the half ton three
 
01:52:14.470 --> 01:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
quarter ton
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles we expect them to last about
 
01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:18.149 align:start position:0%
vehicles we expect them to last about
150

01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
150
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
000 miles in about seven to ten years so
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
those are kind of the parameters we're
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
using so you can see on this chart
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
um we have the total number of units
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
about 1258 units that we have
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
and you can see in um in that column d
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
the number of units in each category so
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
for example we have 70
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
that are categorized as extra heavy duty
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
trucks those are uh
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
10 wheelers those are uh striper trucks
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh tractor trucks um bridge inspector
 
01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:49.990 align:start position:0%
uh tractor trucks um bridge inspector
truck

01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
truck
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
um the tr the heavy duty trucks those
 
01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:54.470 align:start position:0%
um the tr the heavy duty trucks those
are

01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
six wheelers those are pretty much uh
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
the sun the the primary uh plow trucks
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we have those are our six
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
wheelers we have 260 units of those uh
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
medium duty those a
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
ton ton and a half trucks light duty
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
three-quarter half ton and so on
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
um associated equipment those are just
 
01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.470 align:start position:0%
um associated equipment those are just
spreaders

01:53:14.470 --> 01:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
spreaders
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
that we have and probably the other big
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
piece is the mobile equipment
 
01:53:21.750 --> 01:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
construction those are our graders and
 
01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.790 align:start position:0%
construction those are our graders and
loaders

01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
loaders
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
so you can see the approximate
 
01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
replacement value cost
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
of each one of those categories and
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
in column f the number that exceed the
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
life expectancy excuse me
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
the life age or usage parameter
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
so in total roughly 277
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
of the 1258 units exceeded
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
the parameters or 22 percent
 
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
in order to replace all that you can see
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
in column j
 
01:53:53.669 --> 01:53:53.679 align:start position:0%
there's a replacement cost associated
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
with that and all the way down to the
 
01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:56.229 align:start position:0%
with that and all the way down to the
bottom

01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
that totals up to 33 million now this
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
was done
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
as at as of july 1st 2020
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
so since that time we have we still had
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
plan 20
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
and 21 acquisitions that were in various
 
01:54:10.159 --> 01:54:11.270 align:start position:0%
and 21 acquisitions that were in various
stages

01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
stages
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
of being purchased and being put in
 
01:54:14.960 --> 01:54:15.910 align:start position:0%
of being purchased and being put in
service

01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
so that was actually 16 million dollars
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
so in essence
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
what i like to call our backlog is
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
roughly that 16.8 million
 
01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679 align:start position:0%
now i do want to say we have done you
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
know the legislature and the governor
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
working with the department
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
have has really done um you know great
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing some funding for
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
fleet over the last two bienniums
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
we had two capital budget items 10
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars in each biennium
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
that helped with addressing the backlog
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
and in the last biennium our fleet
 
01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
was um i would say our fleet
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
was fully funded however because of
 
01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:57.750 align:start position:0%
was fully funded however because of
covert

01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
covert
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
we did have to look hard at that and we
 
01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:01.750 align:start position:0%
we did have to look hard at that and we
did

01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:07.679 align:start position:0%
we also received vw settlement funds for
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
our heavy equipment i believe
 
01:55:12.149 --> 01:55:12.159 align:start position:0%
we received roughly 4 million a little
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
over 4 million for that
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
from that source of funding so we have
 
01:55:19.270 --> 01:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
done well in the past
 
01:55:22.390 --> 01:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
we are uh with with the current
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh budget my fear is we're gonna fall uh
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
behind again uh the two million dollars
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
certainly um is not enough to even
 
01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.589 align:start position:0%
certainly um is not enough to even
sustain

01:55:33.589 --> 01:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
sustain
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
um the the vehicles that will
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
next year uh be beyond our
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
um our fleet parameters so in essence
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
we we've noted an 8.9 million is really
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
what our target level should be annually
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
to put towards fleet equipment
 
01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.070 align:start position:0%
to put towards fleet equipment
replacements

01:55:54.070 --> 01:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
replacements
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
if we do not put that dollar forth then
 
01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to fall behind
 
01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.589 align:start position:0%
we're going to fall behind
um

01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
and i think you know to catch up over
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
time if we spread this out over five
 
01:56:07.119 --> 01:56:07.990 align:start position:0%
time if we spread this out over five
years

01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
just just addressing this backlog of
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
16.8 million
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know we would have to you know
 
01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:15.109 align:start position:0%
you know we would have to you know
provide

01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
3.3 million over the 8.9 million
 
01:56:20.870 --> 01:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
in order just to address the backlog and
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
get everything on
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
so with that i know there was a question
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
um two-wheel pickups versus four-wheel
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
pickups in the north country
 
01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
um i'll answer that and then answer you
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
know any other questions but
 
01:56:42.950 --> 01:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know basically that four wheel drive
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
pickup trucks um costs probably three to
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars more
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
than your two wheel pickup um if you
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
look at the 141 number and 173 number
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
that's how many um pickups that we have
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
half that's constantly quarter ton
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so it really
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
boils down to a standard and
 
01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:11.199 align:start position:0%
if we look at that class of truck
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
if we convert all those two-wheel
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
pickups to four-wheel pickups
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know you mean you'll be looking at
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
probably needing another
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
um million and a half roughly in order
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
so we are we are evaluating the benefit
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
cost of that
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know certainly a four wheel drive
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
pickup costs uh more
 
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
upfront and more long term to maintain
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
we have an equipment needs committee
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
that will be looking much closer at that
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
i know there's a lot of foremen
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
that feel they need a four-wheel drive
 
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:43.910 align:start position:0%
that feel they need a four-wheel drive
pickup

01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
pickup
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
but it has been a decision in the past
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
that too will
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know suffices when we look at the
 
01:57:52.880 --> 01:57:53.430 align:start position:0%
you know suffices when we look at the
cost

01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
the overall cost of that category of the
 
01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.510 align:start position:0%
the overall cost of that category of the
fleet

01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
fleet
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
um so with that i'll be happy to answer
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
representative heath you had a question
 
01:58:05.119 --> 01:58:05.589 align:start position:0%
representative heath you had a question
yes

01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:58:08.229 --> 01:58:08.239 align:start position:0%
um i just want to go back to the 10
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
million that
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
was appropriated in the capital budget
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
um did i hear you say that some of those
 
01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
funds were lapsed and they actually did
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
not go
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
toward the fleet nope um what i meant to
 
01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:22.070 align:start position:0%
toward the fleet nope um what i meant to
say

01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
the the the capital funds did not lapse
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
we're still
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
working on drawing those funds down what
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
has lapsed is
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the last budget i think we had
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
roughly nine million dollars
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
in each year for fleet equipment some of
 
01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:35.750 align:start position:0%
in each year for fleet equipment some of
those

01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:58:39.189 --> 01:58:39.199 align:start position:0%
funds in 20 have lapsed and in 21
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
um they're not being expended
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh cu can you explain to me why
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
um just because of the situation with
 
01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we were looking at you know essential
 
01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
um purchases and at that time we were
 
01:59:01.910 --> 01:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we were deeming that there were other
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
more important expenditures that were
 
01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:06.629 align:start position:0%
more important expenditures that were
necessary

01:59:06.629 --> 01:59:06.639 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
and we needed to make sure that we
 
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
didn't run the highway fund into such a
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be difficult to
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
address that in this budget
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
and one final question if you don't mind
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
um i just need to go back to the the
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
fleet maintenance
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
you say that you need eight million
 
01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
um but you only have two million dollars
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
and this is the by not budgeting
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars a year it puts you
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
way behind
 
01:59:41.669 --> 01:59:41.679 align:start position:0%
um can you just speak to that again um
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like there was enough
 
01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.510 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like there was enough
money

01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
but it didn't have it it lapsed because
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the situation
 
01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i just need more explanation please so
 
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:52.950 align:start position:0%
i i just need more explanation please so
representative

01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
traditionally we were underfunded for
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
equipment this is how we came to have a
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
significant backlog
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
so if you recall during the last budget
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
we were advocating for both capital
 
02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:06.149 align:start position:0%
we were advocating for both capital
dollars

02:00:06.149 --> 02:00:06.159 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
to play catch up on that backlog and
 
02:00:10.870 --> 02:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
then for the first time in many many
 
02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:11.669 align:start position:0%
then for the first time in many many
years

02:00:11.669 --> 02:00:11.679 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
you increased our budget so we could
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
replace vehicles
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
so that's what chris is referring to so
 
02:00:21.109 --> 02:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
we had a capital budget item in hb 25
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
to address prior deferred replacements
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
and then you increase the funding in our
 
02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
operating budget to around that nine
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars per year
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
so we could keep pace going forward and
 
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
start replacing vehicles at the right
 
02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.189 align:start position:0%
start replacing vehicles at the right
frequency

02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
but when covet hit and we knew that
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
there was nobody driving
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
which was absolutely necessary right to
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
stop the spread of covet 19 we
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
completely support why we had
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home orders and why then the
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
governor flexed things open
 
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know on a gradual basis but with the
 
02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
revenue picture being so uncertain
 
02:00:56.390 --> 02:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
there was a hiring freeze implemented
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
all of our capital purchases were frozen
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
because the last thing we wanted to do
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
was incur more debt and not having the
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
revenue to pay the debt service
 
02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium and then in
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
addition we were asked to lapse as much
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
money as we could
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
to put us in a strong position for this
 
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
upcoming budget
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
and so that's what chris is referring to
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
we did not move forward with the capital
 
02:01:20.430 --> 02:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
budget items because those were frozen
 
02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:21.830 align:start position:0%
budget items because those were frozen
temporarily

02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
temporarily
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
that has been lifted now that we
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
understand you know what is budgeted for
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
debt service and the governor's budget
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
we're moving forward with some of our
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
capital budget items that were approved
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
last time around and then in addition
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
um we lapsed the majority of
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
um the funding that was provided in our
 
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
that was associated with truck purchases
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
that we hadn't
 
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
initiated when clove it hit so
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
we did not replace the vehicles that we
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
had intended to replace
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
when you gave us that additional 18
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
million for the biennium
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's why it looks like
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the money we did
 
02:02:03.109 --> 02:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
but then we didn't spend it it was
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
because of kovitch
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
we proceeded very cautiously and we
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
we tightened our belts and we focused on
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
core maintenance activities
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
so we did not make any large purchases
 
02:02:17.350 --> 02:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
whether it was materials
 
02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
or equipment we did a lot of more
 
02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:22.310 align:start position:0%
or equipment we did a lot of more
traditional

02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance and smaller
 
02:02:25.830 --> 02:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
scale projects this past year in
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
effort to save as much money as we could
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
another area you know
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
typically would have hired a lot of
 
02:02:32.310 --> 02:02:32.320 align:start position:0%
seasonal help for things like line
 
02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
seasonal help for things like line
striping

02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
striping
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
instead of bringing in seasonal workers
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
our highway maintenance crews
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
staffed and supported line striping
 
02:02:40.239 --> 02:02:41.189 align:start position:0%
staffed and supported line striping
efforts

02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
which then meant we were able to lapse
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
more money on the highway side
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
because we just we were very concerned
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
about the revenue outlook
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so for this budget i want to say
 
02:02:54.229 --> 02:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
again you know in our agency phase
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
we too agree that we don't want to fund
 
02:02:58.950 --> 02:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
the fleet at the expense of other areas
 
02:03:00.149 --> 02:03:00.159 align:start position:0%
of department
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
and that's what you see in the
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but certainly if there
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
was to be more revenue
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
or one-time federal money where we had
 
02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility on how we use it
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
the fleet is the first thing that we
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
would want to
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
to fund and replacing these trucks
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
will make us run more efficiently as a
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
department and take a lot of stress
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
off the employees who end up having to
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
work on these older vehicles all right
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you it's just very frustrating um
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
to hear um we worked so hard to get you
 
02:03:31.750 --> 02:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
those extra dollars
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then to hear that they weren't used
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
and none of us anticipated though the
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
financial situation that covered would
 
02:03:39.990 --> 02:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
have put us in
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
so yeah we're sorry that that hard work
 
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the support that we saw from the
 
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
governor and the legislature you know we
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
weren't able to execute on the plan that
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative bucco you have a question
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
yes i do thank you madam chair uh
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner um
 
02:04:00.069 --> 02:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
i might be repeating what you've already
 
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
said but i want to be clear on what i'm
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
looking at on this page
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
mechanical services so it says
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
um current replacement needs are 33
 
02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:10.149 align:start position:0%
um current replacement needs are 33
million

02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:04:13.189 --> 02:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
and planned for 2021
 
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
is 16.2 million
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
leaving a a shortage of 16.8 million
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct first of all i guess
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
that is correct so those plan
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 and 21 acquisitions there
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
with a a capital b a capital budget
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated uh they are with
 
02:04:35.679 --> 02:04:36.069 align:start position:0%
that was appropriated uh they are with
um

02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
vw and
 
02:04:42.709 --> 02:04:42.719 align:start position:0%
some of the some of the um monies
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.709 --> 02:04:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i mean i have a follow-up
 
02:04:50.719 --> 02:04:51.270 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i mean i have a follow-up
um

02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
certainly um down
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
down in the bottom left-hand corner you
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
have catch-up time and
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
i so um to pay it off
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
to catch up in one year would be 16.7
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
million which is the total on the other
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
column or it's broken down into five
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
years and 10 years
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
um i i guess that's my question
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
well well the other question was you
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
need 8 million eight eight million
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
per year is what you what you should
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
have yeah so the key thank you
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
replacing vehicles at the appropriate
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
frequency you know our suggestion would
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
be to fund things at
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
that eight to nine million dollar mark
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
so that we'd be
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
taking vehicles off the road you know
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
the right time and not incurring all
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
this additional expense trying to keep
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
them running
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
while we very much love the federal
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
government to give us some
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know stimulus dollars or have access
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
to funding
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
to address the fleet and we would be
 
02:05:52.790 --> 02:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
very concerned if we replaced all of the
 
02:05:54.390 --> 02:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles at one time
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
because then 10 years from now or 12
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
years from now you'd have that looming
 
02:05:58.400 --> 02:05:59.270 align:start position:0%
years from now you'd have that looming
liability

02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
liability
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we'd have a lot of vehicles all
 
02:06:02.950 --> 02:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
reaching the end of their
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
useful life around the same time um so
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's why we
 
02:06:10.870 --> 02:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
show you some you know different um
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
time frames over which to address the
 
02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
time frames over which to address the
backlog

02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
backlog
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
um so that you could invest a smaller
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
amount and not end up
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
you know a decade from now in a similar
 
02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:22.790 align:start position:0%
you know a decade from now in a similar
situation

02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:06:25.750 --> 02:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative lynn you
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh madam chair um uh
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know i it i understand it sounds
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
like you have
 
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
challenges in a number of areas and i
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
completely understand that and
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering this last area of
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of the fleet
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
that you talked about it seems it seems
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
is particularly critical i mean
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
especially in winter months for snow
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
plowing and stuff like that and
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess one of the things i'm just
 
02:06:58.550 --> 02:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
wondering i know you mentioned that the
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze has now been lifted and
 
02:07:02.069 --> 02:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about i think
 
02:07:02.079 --> 02:07:03.030 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about i think
earlier

02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
um hiring certain personnel in uh
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
like for plan you know in that that do
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
things like planning new projects and
 
02:07:11.589 --> 02:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
and i don't mean to suggest for a minute
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
that i don't think that's important
 
02:07:17.109 --> 02:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
but i'm just wondering in terms of sort
 
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
of ordering
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
priorities you know in what is a very
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
difficult time
 
02:07:25.750 --> 02:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
if it since you don't have the people
 
02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:26.149 align:start position:0%
if it since you don't have the people
that

02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:28.149 --> 02:07:28.159 align:start position:0%
you know the you don't have those hires
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
that you need
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
would it be better not to hire them to
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
put that off
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know for another year or even
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
another two years
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and do more to to upgrade the fleet
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
um so representative lin i think it
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
if i take some time to explain our
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
municipal aid and construction program
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
so we we really don't use a lot of
 
02:07:54.069 --> 02:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
highway funds
 
02:07:57.350 --> 02:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
to replace
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
and expand our infrastructure the
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
majority of the money that we're
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
spending in construction
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
is federal dollars or turnpike dollars
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
with some money going to
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
betterment projects and work on roadways
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
that aren't eligible for federal
 
02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:13.990 align:start position:0%
that aren't eligible for federal
assistance

02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
02:08:15.990 --> 02:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
but even in those categories a lot of
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
the money is coming from sb 367.
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
so it's pledged to that rural bridge in
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
paving we can't take that money and
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
spend it a different way
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the conditions of
 
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
the federal loan that we got we had to
 
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
pledge that revenue
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
and so what you're talking about is
 
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
deferring work
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
that isn't actually funded with highway
 
02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:35.430 align:start position:0%
that isn't actually funded with highway
funds

02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
all of the majority of our project
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
development activity and our
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
construction activity
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
is funded from the other sources and
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
those revenues are either state funds
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
that are restricted
 
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
or federal programs where we cannot use
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
the money for routine operations
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
and maintenance and so it's our
 
02:08:54.310 --> 02:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance that most
 
02:08:55.270 --> 02:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
heavily draws
 
02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
on the highway fund and when we talk
 
02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
on the highway fund and when we talk
about

02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
operations you know it's really our
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
people that
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
drive the trucks and do the work the
 
02:09:05.679 --> 02:09:06.550 align:start position:0%
drive the trucks and do the work the
equipment

02:09:06.550 --> 02:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
and then the materials that are
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
necessary you know for
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
either buying salt or in the summer
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
months it's you know buying
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
asphalt or pipe or whatever it is we're
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
using for
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
our routine work so um
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's the most challenging part about
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
transportation actually when we work on
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan with your colleagues
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
in public works and highways we go
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
through all the colors of money and the
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
restrictions and how we can spend it
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
but really you know we're talking about
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted revenue
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's only funding our
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
operations activities and
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're making really tough decisions
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we get a lot of complaints
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
about things like mowing and litter
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
pickup and graffiti removal because
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh with the financial
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
health of the highway fund we're
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
public safety first and foremost and
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
then you know state of good repair
 
02:10:08.870 --> 02:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
and we get to all of the more aesthetic
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
things if and when the resource is
 
02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
things if and when the resource is
materialized

02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate that
 
02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i appreciate that
explanation

02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair um
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner you may want to
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
answer this later i know we worked
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
really hard last time to try to
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
do some sort of a plan to help you get
 
02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
out of this
 
02:10:33.589 --> 02:10:33.599 align:start position:0%
this equipment morass and
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
if there's one best thing we can do for
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
you this round would it be to try to
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
come up with that six or eight
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
i guess if there's two million in there
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
the six million to try to get you back
 
02:10:43.119 --> 02:10:43.990 align:start position:0%
the six million to try to get you back
on

02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
track in terms of replacing equipment or
 
02:10:49.510 --> 02:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
are there other things that you you know
 
02:10:51.189 --> 02:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
what's the one best thing we can do for
 
02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
you in this
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh in this budget round and there's a
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
reason we finished with
 
02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
this equipment slide if there was either
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
one-time federal revenue that comes in
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
the next
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
several months if there's a stimulus
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
package passed by congress
 
02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
or there's any general funds or other
 
02:11:11.189 --> 02:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue available
 
02:11:12.870 --> 02:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
then we know exactly where we put it it
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
would be to fund
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
the replacement of vehicles i think
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
we'll give it our best shot
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
but we appr we would not as i keep
 
02:11:23.510 --> 02:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
saying in our own agency phase
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
we did not fund the equipment at a
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
higher level than the governor did
 
02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:28.390 align:start position:0%
higher level than the governor did
because

02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
we would not want to see cuts elsewhere
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
because you're talking about limiting
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
our capacity to perform the work you
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
know we need
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
all three we need people equipment and
 
02:11:39.199 --> 02:11:42.629 align:start position:0%
all three we need people equipment and
materials

02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
committee okay
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none um we truly appreciate your
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
um openness and uh
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
all of the things that you have uh
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
brought to us today
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
and um just so that
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know we will be scheduling something
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
next week to um i'm not sure which day
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
at this point but to do a uh
 
02:12:20.069 --> 02:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
a deeper dive into
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
the um finances
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the highway fund and
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
so really i i appreciate this very very
 
02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:30.790 align:start position:0%
so really i i appreciate this very very
much

02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%

02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
so two two big
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh areas today that uh that we're
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
