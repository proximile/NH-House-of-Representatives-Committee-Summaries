morning are really
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
two options one is to either recommend
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
for future legislation or two
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
not recommend for future legislation
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
i also want to say that even though we
 
00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.509 align:start position:0%
i also want to say that even though we
recommend

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
future or not future legislation this
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
does not prohibit
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
someone from filing a bill on the
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
particular topic
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
deal with an open session i will open
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
the session on each bill
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
asking dave luno to basically cite the
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
number of the bill
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
open work session and moving immediately
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
to an exact session on that bill
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
and we will then take a motion and have
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
an action
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative flanagan representative

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:55.990 align:start position:0%
i think maybe if people recall back to
the

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%

um uh it was uh it was a long day of
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
hearings and i think it was uh towards
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
the day and um and
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
my notes are a little um um
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
brief on it but i think there was some
 
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.750 align:start position:0%
brief on it but i think there was some
confusion

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
with respect to the rsa the the relevant
 
00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:19.750 align:start position:0%
with respect to the rsa the the relevant
rsa

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
that um that this would need to be um
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
where it would need to go but it was
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
um to um provide reimbursements to
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
that um that face transportation costs
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh following a court-ordered placement
 
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.430 align:start position:0%
uh following a court-ordered placement
uh

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
to uh to a school where the where the
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
student is um
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
is currently attending um
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
the um uh i uh you know my feeling is
 
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a very good um uh
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
policy i think it needs some work and um
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i think it probably needs to be
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
folded into um
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
into the work that the uh any any work
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
with regards to school funding
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
specifically transportation and these
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
are things that the
 
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
school funding commission is also taking
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
up so um
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i would um when we get into an exec
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
i would i would recommend it for um for
 
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments on uh house
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill 716.
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
yeah i have one uh mel
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
um when when this bill was introduced it
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
was a result
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
of a student that was in district a
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
being placed by the court in district b
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
and its latter part of the school year
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
and the student educationally is best
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
served remaining
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
in school district a
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
however the child is now legally being
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
placed in district b
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
and now it's up to district b if they're
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to provide that transportation
 
00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.509 align:start position:0%
going to provide that transportation
cost

00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
to district a there are some issues with
 
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:02.629 align:start position:0%
to district a there are some issues with
this

00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
especially when you get into some real
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
high cost
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
transportation issues associated with an
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
iep or special education services
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
however the intent and the principle
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
behind this
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think is a good one and i i think that
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
it needs to go forward but i believe as
 
00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:23.269 align:start position:0%
it needs to go forward but i believe as
um

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
dave luno just mentioned there perhaps
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
are some issues with the
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
respect to reference to a specific rsa
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
and also having more information in
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
terms of how this is going to really
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
impact the financial costs
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
of the of the district who's now re
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
response has agreed to
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
accept this child and keep the child
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
but um is not any longer
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
receiving that special ed support so
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
funding support um that's the comment
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
it was an issue that we could not
 
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
resolve in committee
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
quickly um therefore we thought it
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
needed more study which we have not been
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
able to give it
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
appearing to have no further comments i
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
will close the work session on that
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%

you mentioned three names of committee
 
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.590 align:start position:0%
you mentioned three names of committee
members

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%

several times
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
and one of the things about this um
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
background the requiring the criminal
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
history background checks
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
record checks um it's kind of in a
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
state of of of revision they
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
they work to try to get um school bus
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
drivers with background checks in
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
multiple districts
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
um there's a new system i think with the
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
department of safety at least they were
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
talking about that
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
about um instituting a new system so
 
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.230 align:start position:0%
about um instituting a new system so
that

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
they could do substitute teachers nurses
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
bus drivers and i think that system is
 
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:58.549 align:start position:0%
bus drivers and i think that system is
also

00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh possibly something the department of
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
education will want to look at
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
um it really uh the bill as we had it
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
really wasn't ready for uh prime
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
time or for further um
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
further future legislation i i think the
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
future legislation has to be a brand new
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
um bill you know
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%

uh with the department of safety's
current

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh capability both in terms of staffing
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
and technology
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
to take on uh an additional burden of
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
this magnitude
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
and so uh we were kind of
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
left saying this is a great idea
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
right now uh we don't have
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh the needed resources in place uh
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
to actually institute it
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
all right uh further comment yes uh
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh this is
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative tanner allen
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
in their subcommittee meeting uh was
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
there any discussion about the
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
multiple background checks required for
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
across districts
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
for for example we have up here uh if
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
you work in two different districts in
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
the same sau you have to get
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh mr uh chair yes uh-huh go
 
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.950 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh mr uh chair yes uh-huh go
ahead

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
um yes there were and uh and in
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
from what i understand they're currently
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
looking and
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh may have in place a way to give
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
background checks criminal
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
history checks to bus drivers from
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
multiple districts
 
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
um and i think that once that system
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of what
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
we looked at and then you know the
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
department of safety realized there was
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
a real problem and they needed to get a
 
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.070 align:start position:0%
a real problem and they needed to get a
new

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
system and find out who's responsible
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
for what
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
but i think it's in the works and and
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
some of it's already probably done
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative all right
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
it should be on muted now yeah um thank
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
you representative miler
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
i think we got to be in regardless which
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
way we go on this bill
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
i i agree it needs more study and more
 
00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
i i agree it needs more study and more
work

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
we don't want to come across as an
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
education committee
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
saying that our people applying for
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
certification don't need a criminal
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely i think we would all
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
support the need for ensure that the
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
people in our classrooms in
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
our schools are having criminal
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns if if a student
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
for example is trying to get into a
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
course that's dealing with teaching in a
 
00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:21.350 align:start position:0%
course that's dealing with teaching in a
classroom

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
you need to have a criminal background
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
check even before you get
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
to the school and you're you're you're
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
working as a full-time or a part-time
 
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.630 align:start position:0%
working as a full-time or a part-time
employee

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
employee
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
with certification um it's just a matter
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
of costs
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay are they going to then have to
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
submit to another criminal background
 
00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
submit to another criminal background
check

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
maybe a year later when they're out to
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
get the first job that they're
 
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
applying for um i i think the criminal
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
background check is
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
needed uh i think we also need to be
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
careful that we're not mixing up
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges here where we have
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
those people requiring
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
certification and those employees
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
not requiring certification
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh so i think the concept needs to move
 
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.269 align:start position:0%
uh so i think the concept needs to move
forward

00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written uh cannot move
 
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.510 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written uh cannot move
forward

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
i represent tanner uh thank you um i
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that this
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is about um people people that
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
are employed
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
whether they're teachers who are
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
certified or bus drivers or
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
they they have to get the criminal
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
background checks this bill actually had
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
two parts to it one
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
one part of it increased the the areas
 
00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:35.510 align:start position:0%
one part of it increased the the areas
of

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
criminal background history that they
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
were looking at including like arson
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
and some of the other things that hadn't
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
been initially in it so that was one
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
part that
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
and simple assault there was a issue
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
about assault as i remember
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
that we were kind of concerned that it
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
was going to include
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
people that may not really need to be
 
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.549 align:start position:0%
people that may not really need to be
included

00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
the other part of this bill was that the
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
state department of education
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
wants to have people who apply for
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
certification they finish college
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
they finish their student teaching which
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
they've taken two background checks at
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
and before they get their certification
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
from the department of education
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
they want another criminal background
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
check and that is because they're
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
they found um we weren't certain how
 
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.310 align:start position:0%
they found um we weren't certain how
many

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
but they found people who were they said
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
a significant number
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
getting certification in new hampshire
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
and then went and taught someplace else
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
and didn't have a background check and
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
those other places that they may be
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
teaching assumed that they had
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
and didn't do an employment background
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
check so
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of moving parts to this
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
bill and as i said i think it needs to
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
not only the department of safety needs
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
to come up with
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
and they may have already different uh
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
ways to to approach this
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
as well as being a little bit more
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
certain about what exactly is happening
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
that people are getting certifications
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire through the department
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
of education to teach
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
but then don't teach in new hampshire
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
the the issue of reciprocity of a
 
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.310 align:start position:0%
the the issue of reciprocity of a
certification

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
from our state to another state was
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
clearly one of the issues that was
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
pointed out in testimony as i recall
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
so we have before us a motion to
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
moved by shaw represe seconded by lad
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
are there further comments on this
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
particular uh recommendation
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman yes sir i i
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
i what i misinterpreted
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
what i wanted for or i i didn't state
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
what i wanted for this because
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
i remember now from the discussion and i
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
don't have my notes in front of me
 
00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:55.990 align:start position:0%
don't have my notes in front of me
unfortunately

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
um that this particular bill
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
really has too much in it and just
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
reading this one line this is the part
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
that i agreed with
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
but there's so much other stuff that was
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
in it
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
that i don't think this particular bill
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
should go forward
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to withdraw my motion and
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
recommend that uh and if uh
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
if representative vlad wants to to go
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
forward he can but i'm gonna withdraw my
 
00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:29.190 align:start position:0%
forward he can but i'm gonna withdraw my
motion

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
so you're withdrawing your motion to
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
move forward recommend
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
that this go forward rick what's your
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%

conveying the point that yes we support
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
teacher certification background checks
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%

uh uh maybe a um
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
an effective date that would provide
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
time for a school district and the state
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
to uh to make implementations and a
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh with respect to the costs that
 
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
that would have to be incurred at the uh
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
at the state
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
local um local levels uh i believe
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
um uh we did reach out to uh the
 
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.310 align:start position:0%

representative milo
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh 1163 is is a very uh
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
important bill in terms of students and
 
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.990 align:start position:0%
important bill in terms of students and
parents

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
youngsters are constantly put at
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
additional stress as are the parents as
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
they move from grade to grade school to
 
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.830 align:start position:0%
they move from grade to grade school to
school

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
as the termination of their binary and
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
non-binary classification
 
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
currently the systems as we heard in the
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
testimony in the larger schools
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
have a contract that uh cost free
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
basically updating if it is a law
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
uh and the smaller systems in the past
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
and some of the more
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
progressive systems have found
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
workarounds the real issue becomes
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
doe changing their documentation piece
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and how they account for these
 
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.350 align:start position:0%
and how they account for these
youngsters

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
youngsters
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think was the most recent figure was
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
around 20 000
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
as a financial note for doe and i don't
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
think this bill should be driven
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
by does needs but rather by student
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
apparent needs mr chairman
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
and i think clearly that this non-binary
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
needs to come back up for future
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow students
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
to progress through our system in the
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
most comfortable and socially emotional
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
effective way thank you thank you uh
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%

1163.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes uh representative luno um i

support everything
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
the the prime sponsor just said um all i
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
was suggesting with respect to the
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is that
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh is that we need to be transparent in
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
terms of costs
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
and uh i was i was encouraged to see
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
that the that the cost
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
seemed relatively marginal um given
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know what we know our educational
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
costs and so many other areas
 
00:32:47.509 --> 00:32:47.519 align:start position:0%
so um so i would i would certainly also
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
support this for future legislation
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
further comments uh cnn i will close the
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%

um i think our our committee is
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for drafting
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
the interim study recommendation um
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
and are we going to follow um practice
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%

their respective uh bill will be
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
responsible for drafting the report
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
and again the uh and these particular
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
things the report does not have to be
 
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.550 align:start position:0%
things the report does not have to be
exhaustive

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
exhaustive
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
you basically indicate uh the nature of
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
the conversation
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh and then forward that to me for uh
 
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.200 align:start position:0%

thank you for that clarification david
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
so and
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
and and also i i think you know unlike
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
unlike other bill reports we don't have
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
majority and minority
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
rights as i noted earlier there's a
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
single report
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
that reflects the conversation of the
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
interim of the exec
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
session right right
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
you know so so happy to and you know
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
like on a split vote like we just had
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's something that
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
needs to be added
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
um when do you want these reports um i
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
would refer to jen
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh on this uh when do these reports have
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
to be submitted uh jen we're not on a
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
tight timeline but
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
i think within the week would be great
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
to give people plenty of time but
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
not let them get kind of forgotten about
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll establish a date before we
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
end on when those reports are due
 
00:36:41.349 --> 00:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay david you want to comment uh
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we heard tremendous testimony on
 
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.550 align:start position:0%
and we heard tremendous testimony on
this

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
um legal testimony testimony from the
 
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.270 align:start position:0%
um legal testimony testimony from the
doe

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
doe
 
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
and uh it's it appeared from
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
we we actually had a subcommittee that
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
was appointed from
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
our original discussion and
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative doherty was on that
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as was representative
 
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.510 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as was representative
cordelli

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the subcommittee came forward with
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the recommendation
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh for interim study but
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
this uh this this bill really would
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
upend what we know as conflict
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
resolution between the department of ed
 
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.670 align:start position:0%
resolution between the department of ed
and

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
the public so um
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
i i think i think it needs more than
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
appearing to have none we will close the
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%

us to partner with the department of

more germane to the
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the conversation this morning um is
 
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.710 align:start position:0%
to the conversation this morning um is
that

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
a similar bill um uh house bill 1328
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
that would that i introduced along with
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
my colleague representative ladd
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
assembled by the senate
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%

uh which was house bill 1558 and um

signed into law by the governor so
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
um so i don't i i don't believe that
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
that 1282 is uh is necessary
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
any longer for consideration and uh and
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
i'll be moving that at the not
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
for students attending i believe
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
following um
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
following some extensive discussion on
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
in school funding commission
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
is that this is an important um uh topic
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
and um and and um and i believe that
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
bill is um is it would be important to
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh to have this addressed
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
comprehensively uh
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
during um during in our school funding
 
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:49.349 align:start position:0%
during um during in our school funding
work

00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
and uh i would be supporting um future
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
legislation for this
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative shaw yes the problem with
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
my bill is that um
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
it really this is a great bill and it's
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
very important
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
manchester and exeter and nashville
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh they're about the only three that it
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
really affects
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
but what happens is the cte people
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
are get furious about it because of the
 
00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.630 align:start position:0%
are get furious about it because of the
funding

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
because it takes away funding from other
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
areas so
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
i would rather see this bill go away
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
and i would rather see a
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
the transportation for cte to be
 
00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
addressed in a package for all
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
transportation and be included in the
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
new funding
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
legislations that will come out for
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
adequate education from the
 
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
education funding commission that's been
 
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.309 align:start position:0%
education funding commission that's been
established

00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:48:55.349 --> 00:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
further comments uh representative vlad
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
um you know i i support what
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative shaw is saying however
 
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that everybody
 
00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.309 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that everybody
understands

00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
understands
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
and i know that represent luna and
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
represent mylar you do
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
because you're on that commission and
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
and of course represent luna chairs it
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
um yes transportation is a
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
a discussion item in that commission a
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
hot discussion at that
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
and where we place this as we are
 
00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
discussing the
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
the other area of catastrophic aid or
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
special education aid
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
is that to be part of adequacy or is
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
that going to be
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
remaining a separate budget item
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
in a separate category with separate
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
funding sources
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that your policy
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative shaw
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
is a good policy i think that any
 
00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.470 align:start position:0%
is a good policy i think that any
student

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
that requires transportation to a cte
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
center regardless of whether that cte
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
center is within the district or not
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's a safety issue it's an issue of
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get more students
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
participating in ctes
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
and coming out with those valuable
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
skills so
 
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
this bill the the intent of the bill
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
the policy behind the bill is solid what
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
has always harmed us in the end
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
is that yes we only have x number of
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
dollars in the pot
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
and the cte centers don't like
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
distributing it you know any
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
further out than they're already doing
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
so it's a funding
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
issue the policy side which our
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee is says
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
i think we should be moving this forward
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
at least getting this concept moving
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
and and resolving for once we need to be
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
well i i think what it needs is a revamp
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
um because um
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
talking with um uh
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
eric i can't name friedrich or whatever
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
his last name is
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
over at d.o.e um he feels that
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
that the language um
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
will affect some other areas of
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
the law and so i need to
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
i need to resubmit a bill and i need to
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
to do it along with him
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
and make sure that that uh the bill i
 
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.069 align:start position:0%
and make sure that that uh the bill i
submit

00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
submit
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't um
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
open up the door for a whole bunch of
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
other funding that
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh uh has unintended consequences let's
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
put it that way
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
so uh that's why i want this one to just
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
go away
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%

as her explanation because i was sort of
the

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
other districts would have um money
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
would have been taken away from
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
other districts in order to supplement
 
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
the transportation costs
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
in the larger school districts where
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
transporting from one side of town to
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
the other is the equivalent of
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
um coming in from another town
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah it was a little bit like the
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
gingerbread man
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of if we change this then it's
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
going to change that
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
and it's going to unintendedly arrive
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
here and change that
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
so i um would listen to representative
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
shaw's concerns
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
about the language in the bill not the
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
policy but the
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
language thank you uh further
 
00:53:19.839 --> 00:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
language thank you uh further
conversation

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
in this work session we
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
we uh represent that approved the first
 
00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:27.990 align:start position:0%
we uh represent that approved the first
bill

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
today the 716
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
to move forward um even though we
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
recognize there are a lot of issues with
 
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.950 align:start position:0%
recognize there are a lot of issues with
it

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
now we're dealing with a similar
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
situation here
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
and we've been dealing with this issue
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
and several years back representative
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
shaw i
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
also sponsor the bill doing exactly what
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is doing
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
we are a policy committee and we're
 
00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.430 align:start position:0%
we are a policy committee and we're
recognizing

00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
that there are really significant issues
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
if eric was here from
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
as dave dougherty knows from the
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
cte advisory commission that
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's a state such as delaware
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
which has more students participating in
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
over 50 percent of the high school
 
00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:21.109 align:start position:0%
over 50 percent of the high school
school

00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
students there participate in a cte
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
class and come out with a cte skill
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they spend they have the same amount
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
of students as we have in this state
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
yet they're putting more emphasis
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars into their cte
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
program we're turning this bill down
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
simply because the other cte programs
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
are going to cry
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going to be funded
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
this at the same rate
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
our funding program for ctes is broken
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
we also have to make a significant
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
decision here regarding
 
00:54:57.990 --> 00:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
is this going to be a part of adequacy
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
or not part of adequacy
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
what happens if it's not then it's going
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
to remain the way it is
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
and we have the kids in exeter nashua
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
and manchester
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
still being screwed um so
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether it comes forward in the same uh
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
language barb
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh or you change it around to stay on
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
task with the principle and the concept
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the policy behind it i think
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
something should move forward
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
i will okay further
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
comments further comments said uh dave
 
00:55:31.359 --> 00:55:32.150 align:start position:0%
comments further comments said uh dave
dougherty

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
dougherty
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
just uh briefly um
 
00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
i agree with rick on this i think um i
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
think this is a good bill
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
um i think just philosophically i think
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
it would be a good idea
 
00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
to be safe and move this forward um
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
it can always be um amended
 
00:56:00.549 --> 00:56:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh or itl at a point where we know we're
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
gonna be able to do
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
something out of the funding commission
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
i just think we'd err on the side of
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
safety on this and
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
and move it forward thanks thank you
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
further comments uh
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
represent tanner i have a question if if
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's recommended for
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
further legislation um it still can be
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
changed significantly
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
isn't that right that representative
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
shaw can change it and
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't she wouldn't be tied to this
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
bill no no no
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
no that's right no okay so it looks like
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
there's some
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
support for the concept of moving
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
forward as we've talked about it here so
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
let's close the work session and let me
 
00:56:47.589 --> 00:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
open uh the
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
exec session on house bill 13
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
44 and i'll call who would like to make
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move this bill forward
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with the cte transportation
 
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:08.789 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with the cte transportation
issue

00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%

allan
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay a move by lad seconded by allard
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
to move this forward is there further
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes um we have
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
um a funding issue with our cte programs
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's broader than just
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
transportation we have a tuition problem
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
where we're funding so many students x
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
number of students
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
and and some districts are capping the
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
number of students that are able to
 
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.270 align:start position:0%
number of students that are able to
participate

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh we should be doing just the opposite
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
with our cte
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
career technical education is a key to
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
our success
 
00:57:55.829 --> 00:57:55.839 align:start position:0%
i'm meeting our goal by 2025 of having
 
00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
65 percent
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
of our our our our kids with some kind
 
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
of a skill
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
or post-secondary degree transportation
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
is critical
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
and i think that our saying yes to this
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
we will communicate that
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
you know we need all our students not
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
just the students that are outside
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
external and manchester we need
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
all our students participating and
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
and that includes all those that were
 
00:58:24.319 --> 00:58:25.190 align:start position:0%
and that includes all those that were
missing

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
missing
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
throughout this entire state so i would
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
like to move this forward
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
simply because the principles involved
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
the concept and the policy
 
00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:36.860 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh further comments
 
00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:38.470 align:start position:0%

and moved by lads seconded by allard is
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
to move uh
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
1344 for future legislation

at educational institutions uh
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%

it was heard in committee on january
23rd

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
23rd
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
and it was exact on um on february 25th
 
01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
i believe it was recommended interim
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
study at a vote of
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
16 to 2 during the hearing there was
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
substantial testimony um um
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
but i also think there were uh concerns
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
that um that uh this bill
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
was also a single committee uh bill
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
and it had several i think uh criminal
 
01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.470 align:start position:0%
and it had several i think uh criminal
um

01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%

01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh elements to it and uh and
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
probably you know if it's um uh you know
 
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
something like this would uh would
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
certainly need to be
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
considered by a by a second policy
 
01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:14.789 align:start position:0%
considered by a by a second policy
committee

01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um i just wanted
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
to say a couple things this is a
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned bill but it's pretty
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
convoluted it's got
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
quite a few mandates and um
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
i think uh it's not quite ready for
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
prime time and i think it needs
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
a lot more work in order to go forward
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative vlad thank you
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
very much uh
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
represent miler when i testified before
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
the committee in support of this bill
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
i stated and i still feel this way i am
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
supportive of 1469's intent
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
in order to move forward with a bill
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
that best fits new hampshire it may be
 
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
wise to consider interim study in order
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
that the u.s university system new
 
01:02:19.359 --> 01:02:20.630 align:start position:0%
that the u.s university system new
hampshire

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
including trustees the community college
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
system of new hampshire
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
the higher education commission the
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
state board of education and the new
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire college and
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
university council be involved
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh and have time to review an
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to submit findings on this
 
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.549 align:start position:0%
opportunity to submit findings on this
bill

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
um there's no room for hazing at all in
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
our post-secondary education
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
hazing is a practice with no value and
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's unhealthy however i do believe
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
that we need to move forward cautiously
 
01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
and have a bill that is
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
been vetted amongst all these different
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
organizations that are involved
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
especially the university system new
 
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.549 align:start position:0%
especially the university system new
hampshire

01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
so i i'm i could go either way on this i
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
think the intent is a wonderful intent
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
however there are some major issues with
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
that this needs a lot of work
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
so perhaps this is one that we should be
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
going the other direction on thank you
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
further comments on on house bill 1469
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%

that really to address
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%

01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
um and um and provide um

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
bill could end up being sort of
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit um duplicative
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
and uh contradictory to uh to some of
 
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.390 align:start position:0%
and uh contradictory to uh to some of
the

01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
the policies that are that are in place

for house bill 1509 um uh while it was

while it was driven by this
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%

conducted by uh
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
by jim silver while he was at the

united states and and really looking at
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
them in
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh in strong detail um
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh the bill did have bipartisan
 
01:09:38.159 --> 01:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
uh the bill did have bipartisan
sponsorship

01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
sponsorship
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
um uh uh but uh
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh but i think most importantly you know
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's an issue that still uh uh
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
is a uh is a problem on our our campuses
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
of higher education
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
and um and i'll be supporting a uh
 
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation for um uh for
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
further legislation uh to help address
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
it may not necessarily be this bill
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
but uh but i think we need to do
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
something to um to help reduce
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh instances of violence incident
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
instances of violence
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%

uh we're dealing with a vulnerable
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
population here and
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh and i think that would be an
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate way forward

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%

uh moved by luno uh seconded by lay
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
to move this for future legislation
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
further conversations
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
any further representative vlad
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
it was a 1010 vote of which
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
i i think that there was a lot of issues
 
01:11:16.149 --> 01:11:16.159 align:start position:0%
when i
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
i know there were a number of issues
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
regarding language which was
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
very uh subjective
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh in one section where it says uh in
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
determining whether a danger exists the
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
court shall determine if the following
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
conditions are met
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
um risk-taking behavior well i have a
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
lot of risk-taking behavior
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
um some people may suffer from
 
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.669 align:start position:0%
um some people may suffer from
depression

01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
depression
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
um giving away away uh prized
 
01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.310 align:start position:0%
um giving away away uh prized
possessions

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
possessions
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh lack of interest in future plans
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
um some of those things you know can go
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
either way
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
and so but if you have four of those
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
things um
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
you're all sudden in this category i
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
think the bill was
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh crafted with a lot of nebulous
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
language in it
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
um and in definition of law enforcement
 
01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:09.669 align:start position:0%
um and in definition of law enforcement
office

01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
officials so with that this bill is
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
definitely not ready to move forward
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
well i know what the motion will
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
probably be i'll probably vote the
 
01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.390 align:start position:0%
probably be i'll probably vote the
opposite

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
opposite
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
well the motion is to move it forward
 
01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.590 align:start position:0%

in opposition to this bill um
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
because it uh again had some
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
ambiguous language in it and also i felt
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
as though the penalties
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the the tools that were given needed
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%

01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
mr chair hospital 1512
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
is titled an act relative to reducing
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
school food
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
waste and addressing child hunger um
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
for brief history it was heard on
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
january 28th
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
exact on february 26th
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the interim study
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation i think that
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
vote was 22 to nothing
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and um and we did hear i think some
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
some uh some uh very uh impassioned uh
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
testimony during the um during the
 
01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:32.630 align:start position:0%
testimony during the um during the
hearing

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh my notes uh suggest
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
that um that that potentially
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
some um some um uh amended language
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
may be uh maybe something that uh that
 
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:47.430 align:start position:0%
may be uh maybe something that uh that
we're

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
considering down the road and um
 
01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
and that it um uh would be worthy of um
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
of uh future considerations so
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you the floor is now open for a
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
conversation regarding
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
1512. i can certainly add
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
to that as you as you may recall i think
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
the idea was um a very
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
um welcome one um
 
01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
on our committee i think there was some
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
concern perhaps that
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
um the bill needed to be flushed out a
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
um with regard to packaging there were a
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
lot of questions that were raised i
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
think the fact that it was
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
20 to zero it was placed on the consent
 
01:16:33.679 --> 01:16:34.790 align:start position:0%
20 to zero it was placed on the consent
calendar

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
for vote which actually as well known
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
didn't happen
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
um but i think this this might give the
 
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.470 align:start position:0%
um but i think this this might give the
um

01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh lsr uh writers a a better opportunity
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
now to
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
maybe involve school nutrition directors
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
or even the superintendents association
 
01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.070 align:start position:0%
or even the superintendents association
um

01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
it i'm i'm not sure if it'll even come
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
back to our committee
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
initially just um with regards to
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
the safety protocols anecdotally my
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
last night at our local budget committee
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
from our sau finance director talking
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
about the success they've had with
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
school lunch delivery um during um
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
the copa 19 um we've we've opted to
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
offer free breakfasts and lunches
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
um in the community and uh they've
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
packaging and preparation and
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
delivery of these things different ways
 
01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
to do it so i think there's a lot more
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
um done for this but um it was uh
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's a good idea so i will um
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
recommend that we uh move forward
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
further conversation uh regarding uh
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
house bill 1512
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative woodcock
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairmal uh just a question if
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
i recall looking at my notes
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
this this specific bill dealt with is
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
this correct enabling legislation that
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be required for all
 
01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:07.590 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be required for all
communities

01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct yeah that's my
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
understanding yes yeah okay
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i mean we could certainly
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
recommend that it be enabled
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
further further conversation uh
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative ladd
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to recall but i believe that
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
is successfully done out in indiana
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh and a lot of success to the program
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it is as as i see it it's a positive
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
thing that we ought to be considering
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to help those
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
families that don't have food on the
 
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.310 align:start position:0%
families that don't have food on the
table

01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
i think we should try to do thank you
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
further comments seeing none will
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%

representative luno thank you very much
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1635 is titled an act
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
requiring climate education
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
my my notes are actually a little thin
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
on them
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
on this one but i do have
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
that on february 26 it was exact
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
13-7 interim study
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
let's see i don't see anybody on the
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
on our committee that was uh that was
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
in um as a sponsor on this but uh i'm
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
gonna end my remarks there
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
as i recall on this particular one i
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
think there was
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh a general concurrence of the need
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
for this to be covered in schools
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
there was a there was some question
 
01:22:00.159 --> 01:22:01.270 align:start position:0%
there was a there was some question
around

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
another mandate another curriculum
 
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.030 align:start position:0%
another mandate another curriculum
mandate

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh to school districts and there were
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
some there was some concern that
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
this is already being taught in a number
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
of different ways
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
and that the bill as i recall was fairly
 
01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.669 align:start position:0%
and that the bill as i recall was fairly
prescriptive

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
prescriptive
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the amount of time
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
and almost outlined a lesson plan
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
to consider this and so i think there
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
but the main concern as i recall was
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
do we want to have another mandate
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
another unfunded mandate that would go
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
to school districts
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh requiring them to deal with this
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
important topic
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's my recollection uh
 
01:22:46.709 --> 01:22:46.719 align:start position:0%
representative mullen and representative
 
01:22:46.719 --> 01:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
representative mullen and representative
ladd

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
ladd
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh and not only not only was it
 
01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.629 align:start position:0%
uh and not only not only was it
prescriptive

01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
prescriptive
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
by grade level the language of the bill
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
was very confusing because
 
01:22:57.669 --> 01:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
even members of our committee had a
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
different understanding of
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
exactly how much climate change
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
education was going to take place
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
at various grade levels so um
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't think it's ready to
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
be looked at before some significant
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
work is done
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
representative glad yes everything
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
that's been said including what you said
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative miler is
 
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
right on the money um i was talking to
 
01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
the people down the coal region
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh center here in hanover dealing with
 
01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:29.750 align:start position:0%
uh center here in hanover dealing with
cold

01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
cold
 
01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
region climate and they're dealing with
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
issues like the permafrost how that's
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
disappearing in various places
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
but they also indicated this is part of
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
our overall
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
science curriculum and
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
when we start identifying specific areas
 
01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:49.590 align:start position:0%
when we start identifying specific areas
within

01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
chapters or titles within and putting
 
01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
that as a mandate
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're starting to get in the realm of
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
where the responsibility lies with
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
the school district for instruction and
 
01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.750 align:start position:0%
the school district for instruction and
curriculum

01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
so i think we've given the prod topic
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
out to our schools through
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
our our our substantive criteria
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
for what an adequate education is by
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
saying you will have standards
 
01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
associated with science
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
um so i don't think there's a need for
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
this bill i think it's
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
starting to get down in the weeds and we
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
better be careful going there
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative allard then
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative doherty
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh i
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
i am supremely confident in the uh the
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
capabilities of our
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
science curriculum educators and i i
 
01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.030 align:start position:0%
science curriculum educators and i i
think

01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh this is a topic best left to them
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh to devise and structure and
 
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
and present and i think we
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
at this level uh trying to dictate
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
things are just gonna muck it up
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative dougherty
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and um
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
i i agree this may not be a perfect bill
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
but i think this topic is so important
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
particularly in what's going on in this
 
01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.629 align:start position:0%
particularly in what's going on in this
country

01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:16.639 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
over the past few months
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that we keep this
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
on the table
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of moving this forward
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
i agreed it might be there might be some
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
need for
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
amendment or change in the bill i know
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
the prom
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is not returning to the
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
house but i'm hoping that somebody else
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
will kind of pick up the torch and run
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
um so i think i think it's valuable to
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
keep this
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
out there for people to understand how
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
important it is
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you represent woodcock thank you
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
i would uh it's interesting to hear
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%

um on day care contract bus services
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
so a lot of open items
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
on it but but i sense a real willingness
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
or real interest i should say to um
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
to see some movement going forward on
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
this representative cornell
 
01:30:47.430 --> 01:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
yeah the subcommittee met numerous times
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
in her
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
testimony from numerous organizations
 
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:51.189 align:start position:0%
testimony from numerous organizations
and

01:30:51.189 --> 01:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
everyone thought it was very important
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
to look at and do something about but it
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
was a lot bigger than
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
the bill or the amendments and um
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
you know the fiscal part of it came into
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
how much would it
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
cost and who should be
 
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
um trained and how will they be trained
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
and then it got into bus drivers
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
and taxi drivers and it just got
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
really really big so we thought it was a
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
really good bill but it really needs a
 
01:31:25.110 --> 01:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
lot more work
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh further comments
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%

01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's also important to recognize all the
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
other allergies that that students have
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
and in so many of our schools now
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
there's not a school nurse
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's still no school nurse
 
01:32:22.870 --> 01:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
coordinator at the doe
 
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
and we have people at elementary schools
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
who are simply the secretary who are
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
taking care of first aid issues and
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
anything that happens and unfortunately
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
allergies are something
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
that you need to be trained on that time
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
is critical that a person could um
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
suffer an allergy attack uh
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
anaphylactic shock and die within
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
minutes uh if they don't get the proper
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
treatment um
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a critical issue uh
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
if for no other reason than to
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
make schools aware of it um and to get
 
01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:01.990 align:start position:0%
make schools aware of it um and to get
them

01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
to work on producing plans and and
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
having something in place
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
to deal with it so i think it's a very
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
important bill to move forward
 
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments on the
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%

these interim bills now you've completed
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%

01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
statements and then you guys will be all
 
01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:07.590 align:start position:0%
statements and then you guys will be all
finished

finished
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
i would i would suggest that uh again
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
those who are moving
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
their respective uh pieces that they
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
have those to me
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
by monday the 28th is that okay jen
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah okay so that gives us
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
about a week to get them to me
 
01:35:26.229 --> 01:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
and again these do not have to be long
 
01:35:26.239 --> 01:35:27.669 align:start position:0%
and again these do not have to be long
statements

01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
statements
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
they basically just had to state the
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
position of the committee and
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
where there was some opposition to them
 
01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
opposition needs to be also incorporated
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
into that single statement that you'll
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
be making before we go
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
i do want to alert you to a
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
a potential joint house senate education
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
committee meeting
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh i believe it's going to be scheduled
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
for october
 
01:35:57.270 --> 01:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
7th and the purpose of that
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
session will be to review
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
the school openings we'd like to have a
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
revisit with those people who presented
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
at the original joint session several
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
and both jay senator khan and i
 
01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
are working to try to identify what has
 
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:19.430 align:start position:0%
are working to try to identify what has
worked

01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
worked
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
and what have been some of the problems
 
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
and some recommendations for going
 
01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:23.590 align:start position:0%
and some recommendations for going
forward

01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm just giving you an alert to that
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
i believe it's going to be on the 7th
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
so just kind of keep a heads up and
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
we'll let you know
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
when that finally is uh is confirmed
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh anything else jen before we close
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
