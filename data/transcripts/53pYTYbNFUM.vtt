today um to get you
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
started I just wanted to kind of walk
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
you through the process as well um so
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%

a variety of different Revenue sources

and how the um agencies um are involved
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
in collecting that and and remitting
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
that back to the state
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I did do is put
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
together kind of a handbook or a
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
document and I'm just going to share my
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
screen I'm not going to go through the
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
whole document but there are some pieces
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
of it I wanted to share with
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
you so let me see
 
00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120 align:start position:0%

share it says it's disabled right
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
now so I'll just keep talking as as I
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
wait for that so you as you go through
 
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
your estimates you're going to be
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
revisiting fiscal year
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
21 figuring out um where you are in
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
terms of the year and where you might
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
end and then you're going to address 22
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
and 23 at the end of that process this
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
committee will put together a house
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
resolution of what your estimates
 
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.389 align:start position:0%
resolution of what your estimates
are

00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
okay and that will go before
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
um the full body of the house and you
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
will discuss it and typically in the
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
past that document has been tabled so
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
let me just stop there for a minute so
 
00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
you should Al just see a document with
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh LBA across the top the New Hampshire
 
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.949 align:start position:0%
uh LBA across the top the New Hampshire

00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
that's we see it okay so
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
the right after that is a contact page
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
for our office because we're working
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
remotely the best way to contact me is
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
through email um but here are the
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
various people in our office Mike Kane
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%

lavenus and Kevin Ripple are all our
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
budget analysts who are um working
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
currently with house finance and putting
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
together information as it relates to
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
the operating budget my other charge is
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
not only house and ways and means but I
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
also work with the capital budget so
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'll be working with Public Works to put
 
00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:20.959 align:start position:0%
that together as well but again that's
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
just our our information if you come
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
into or call our office you will
 
00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:28.839 align:start position:0%
typically um you see Pam Ellis who's our
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
admin ministrative assistant she's kind
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
of the point person for us she's the
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
knower of all
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
information so the way this document is
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
structured is that um there's some
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
information on different acronyms or
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
terms you may hear throughout the
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
process followed by um just a quick
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
summary of the various tax rates for the
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
general and education trust trust fund
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
revenues that you are collected after
 
00:13:54.389 --> 00:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
that is a resolution that was done for
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2019 for your 21 uh excuse
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
me 2021 um operating budget and then
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'll show you um House Bill one or in
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
this case it was House Bill three the
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
operating budget and where your
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
estimates end up in
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
there understand that when you're doing
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
your estimates they will be done on
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
current law so as a committee of the
 
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
ways and means you will see bills coming
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
in that suggest or would want to make
 
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
changes to some of the revenue streams
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
that you're collecting um you wouldn't
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
consider that in your estimates that
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
addressed um after when I say after that
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
would be incorporated into a surplus
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
statement that's prepared by our office
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
at the direction of um legislative
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
leadership um house finance and and the
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
ways and means chair um would direct our
 
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
office to put together that Surplus
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
statement and include certain
 
00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:48.030 align:start position:0%
statement and include certain
information

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
so again I just mentioned here's some of
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
the terms that you may see uh one thing
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
that people sometimes hear and confuse
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
is you'll hear the term road toll that
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
is not the the tolls that you see on the
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
turnpike system that is actually your
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
gas tax that you you'll hear about for
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
your Highway fund for unrestricted
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
revenues um but it's easy to get that
 
00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
that mixed
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
up um as I said there's a page that just
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
kind of shows you the the rates so
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
across the top here you'll see the
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
business profits tax it's located in RSA
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
77a the rates are contained in Colon 2
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
the total rate for your business profit
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
tax right now is 7
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
.7% of that 1.5% goes to the education
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
trust fund and 6.2% goes to your general
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
fund that's directed by the statutes at
 
00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759 align:start position:0%
the end of this document are the the
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
statutes are listed along with some
 
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.269 align:start position:0%
statutes are listed along with some
historical

00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
information this next document or piece
 
00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
of document that I'm showing you
 
00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
starting on page four is the house
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
resolution in 2019 for the operating
 
00:15:59.790 --> 00:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
budget so once your committee was done
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
we put together this resolution that
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
shows you the education trust fund and
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
general fund um Revenue totals so you
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
had your official estimate for fiscal
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
year 19 and then what the committee
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
believed was going to happen with
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
revenues to the rest of
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
19 so that you can see the numbers are
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
slightly different than what had been
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
projected before and then from there you
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
built your estimates for 20 and
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
21 and you did the same thing for the
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
highway fund and the fishing game fund
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
so you're going to be seeing um
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
information historical information
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
coming to you from the agencies today
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to talk about the last
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
five years of their revenue collections
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
um you'll be able to see some Trends
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
with that there's information in this
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
document as well that you can look at um
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
I reference other documents within this
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
to direct you to as
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
well so once all your estimates are done
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
the resolutions pass
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
and your numbers are then included into
 
00:16:58.069 --> 00:16:58.079 align:start position:0%
the house version of the operating
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
budget typically
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's House Bill one in this case it
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
three and you'll find
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
um in the budget you'll find your
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
operating budget your unrestricted
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
revenues in what they call the back of
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
the of the budget so as you can see here
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is Page 709 of the operating budget
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
all the information before that is the
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
the numbers you know the dollars that
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
have been appropriated to the
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
agencies everything after that or what
 
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
we refer to as the back of the budget or
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
sections in the back of the
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
budget and it has things like here this
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
is positions that have been abolished
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
from the budget because um these are
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
included in the operating budget these
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
position numbers if they an agency no
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
longer needs them or the legislature has
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
decided that they need to reduce some
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
positions they actually have to abolish
 
00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:55.270 align:start position:0%
positions they actually have to abolish
the

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
positions but then you will see here's
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
your unrestricted revenues these again
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
are just the estimates that you've made
 
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
based on current law these will be
 
00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
adjusted through each phase of the
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
budget process so the house will have
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
its version the Senate would have its
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
version and then at Committee of
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
conference after um whatever Agreements
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
are made there would be a committee of
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
conference um ped version of the of the
 
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.029 align:start position:0%
conference um ped version of the of the
um

00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
revenues and as I stated there may be
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
some bills that get passed by the house
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
there may be bills that are passed by
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
the Senate and House and and look like
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to go into current law as
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
each phase goes we will in incorporate
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
those into the Surplus statement and
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
this document you see on your screen now
 
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
is is a um Surplus statement for the
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
current B any more in and again it you
 
00:18:50.149 --> 00:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
address the year that you're building
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
the budget in so in this case you're
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with fiscal year 2019 and then
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
you have your fiscal 20 and 21 after
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
that on row four are your estimated
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
revenues so these are your truly the
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
numbers from House Bill one totaled up
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
this is education trust fund and general
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
fund together and then row five would be
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
any Revenue adjustments and those
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue adjustments would be again any
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
bills that would make changes to the um
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
revenues going forward that have been
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
passed or you believe will be passed or
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
any language that's contained in House
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 or the trailer bill Bill the
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill typically accompanies the
 
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.310 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill typically accompanies the
operating

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
budget and if I take you
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
to so this this page here page
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
15 um shows you schedule one which again
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
is all the the this is just the general
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
funds we break it up by General and
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
education trust funds so these are the
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
revenues that were contained in um House
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
Bill one or the operating budget and
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
then there's a page starts called
 
00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
schedule two and you'll see there's a
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of activity on there and the
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
first top of that are Revenue
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
adjustments and why there's an
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment being made so line four for
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
instance in the operating budget they
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
added um some Dr auditor positions and
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
had some Revenue estimates associated
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
with adding those positions of $200,000
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 and then two million
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
2021 there was language that um dealt
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
with business tax Conformity there was
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
language related to the tobacco tax and
 
00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
um applying the tax to ecigarettes and
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
there's different assumptions made on
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
what Revenue would be collected so
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
of we again we do the same thing for the
 
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.669 align:start position:0%
of we again we do the same thing for the
highway

00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
highway
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
fund scrolling slowly so I don't get
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
anybody too sick with the motion so we
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
do the same thing with the highway fund
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
as well as the fishing game fund so
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
there's a surplus statement that's
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
issued by our office to give you a sense
 
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
of what's occurring um typically we have
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
the four
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
columns Governor house senate and
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference on the earlier
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
for the general fund education trust
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
fund because the budget was vetoed and
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
there was a um negotiation that occurred
 
00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:14.549 align:start position:0%
there was a um negotiation that occurred
to

00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
um get by that beeto and pass a budget
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
there was some changes that did occur in
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
three so once the budget's passed the
 
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
takes the Revenue information and builds
 
00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:33.559 align:start position:0%
um a revenue a monthly Revenue
 
00:21:36.669 --> 00:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
plan they do that with advice and and
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
discussions with the agencies that
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
collect the revenues and it's just to
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
get a sense of when you're going to see
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
revenues come into the state on a cash
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
basis and you you you'll hear as you go
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
through this process you know there
 
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
there's five months that are typically
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
your larger months for Revenue
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
collection September December which have
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
already occurred
 
00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:02.919 align:start position:0%
and then March April and
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
June and you you will often hear that
 
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
the house is at a disadvantage with the
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
revenue projections because you haven't
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
seen March and April's
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
revenues um the past few bium the house
 
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee has met in
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
April May and sometimes beginning of
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
June as you're going through this
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
process to revisit your revenues and you
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
may even do an amendment to the
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
resolution that you had tabled earlier
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
um part of that is just to make sure
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
that you have some um upto-date
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
information on what's going on with the
 
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
revenues so when you go to committee a
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
conference you can have that discussion
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
Senate the revenue plan is put together
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
for the general fund the education trust
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
fund um fishing game and Highway
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
funds and again it's just a plan it's an
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
estimate you will sometimes see from one
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
month to the next that maybe a revenue
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
stream was below plan but it comes in
 
00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
the following month
 
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
um so sometimes there's a timing issue
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
of of when things are
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
collected so you'll hear that discussed
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
and then what the department does after
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
that is at the end of each month they
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
put together the monthly Revenue focus
 
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
and you should start to receive
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
that um this is a good document to tell
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
you or get provide you some insight as
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
to what's occurring um with the
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
collection of your revenues this current
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
month is we'll show you um the
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
collection for the month of this is
 
00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:30.799 align:start position:0%
December so in December your actuals
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
compared to plan and if you are below or
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
above that this analysis is just a brief
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
um commentary from the agencies on
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
what's happening with some of the major
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
taxes that are being collected um
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it helps explain why a number
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
is up or down in a particular month and
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
what to expect maybe in the upcoming
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
month there's other information
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
contained in this document that relates
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
to real estate um transfer tax meals and
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
rooms um cigarette tobacco tax stamps um
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
there's also fishing game and Highway
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
fund at the end of this this table here
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
would show you just a comparison of uh
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 to fiscal
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
20 and then again I think what is
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
probably more useful in this document is
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
this year-to-date comparison so this
 
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
provides you how much revenue have you
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
collected through
 
00:24:24.669 --> 00:24:24.679 align:start position:0%
December and if you go down to the
 
00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
bottom right hand corner you'll see that
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
you're 54.3 m milon do ahead of plan
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
after you've accounted for the $30
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
million of um that you've heard
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
anomalous that came in 21 that should
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
have been credited to 20 and has been
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
done um in the cafer but because this is
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
on a cash basis it still shows up in the
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
numbers and so they just do a a
 
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
correction on this table and at the end
 
00:24:52.789 --> 00:24:52.799 align:start position:0%
of the year they'll reverse that out
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
they in the department of administrative
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
services and then this table here just
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
shows you where the um revenue is
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
million and as I said you got the
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
highway and the fishing game fund also
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
on here so it's a it's a nice document
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
to look at you typically will see that
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
um three to five business days after the
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
close of the month um the department
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
usually will email that but it it's also
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
available on their website and there's
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
links on our website to
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
that this page here just gives you a
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
sense of for some of the revenue that's
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
collected and we'll use meals and rooms
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
as an example so in December when you
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
see the meals and rooms Revenue that is
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
for the activity that occurred in
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
November so just to kind of keep that in
 
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
mind when you're looking at some of
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
these that it's for the prior month's
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
activity that you're giving you're um
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
month and then this is a document that
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
our office puts together um at the end
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
of each month we will put all the data
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
into this spreadsheet and what it
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
provides you is over seven years um kind
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
of how much was collected in dollars on
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
a cash basis but then what percentage of
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
the year of collection that was so for
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
instance if you look at the business
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
profits tax you'll see that you know in
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
21 you collected $26 million but
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
typically you're somewhere
 
00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
between 10 million and 17 million so
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
you're up in
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
21 so that may be something that you
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
consider as you think about your
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
estimating this is a 15-page document so
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
quick the cafer the comprehensive annual
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
financial report which has now been
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
released it was released um just prior
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
to December 31st um there's just a
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
couple of pages I wanted to point out in
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
there page eight is a surplus statement
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
so that would be the information that um
 
00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
has been audited so those are the real
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
numbers those are the of of what
 
00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:06.440 align:start position:0%
occurred in terms of revenues and any um
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that were were
 
00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
expended and then also in that same
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
report on page 146 you have a historical
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
they provide a
 
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.070 align:start position:0%
they provide a
10-year

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
um recap of the of the revenues that
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
have been collected there's other
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
information but I just point out the
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
revenues so in this case it's the
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
general funds and you can see that beer
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
taxes from 2011 has been ranging from $
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
12.9 million to a low of 12.6 in 2017 to
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
13.1 in 2020 so just gives you a sense
 
00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
occurring I also show that for the
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
fund fishing game fund and the highway
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
fund so they're also in
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
there and I'm speeding up a little bit
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
because I I'm going to need to stop
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
because I want to let Di get
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
started um I also took a snippet from
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
the um offering statement from treasury
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
for the bonds and the reason that I
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
included this is there's some good
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
information as it relates to the revenue
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
stabilization Reserve account as well as
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
the various revenues that you're
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
collecting so starting on page there's
 
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
an it's called information uh statement
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
within the document on page 13 of that
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
is the revenue stabilization Reserve
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
account and following that are State
 
00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
revenues and just gives you a little bit
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
of history on each of those just a
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
narrative um to read about if you're
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
trying to get a sense of what's going on
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
tax and then as I stated the last part
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
document contains the rsas as it relates
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
to the various Revenue sources that
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
you're looking at so here's the
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
education trust fund this RSA tells you
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
the various components that are
 
00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
deposited into that here's the business
 
00:28:59.509 --> 00:28:59.519 align:start position:0%
tax uh business profits
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
tax again RSA 77 A2 tells you what the
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
tax rate is and then in this case where
 
00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
the funds are going is 77 a20 colon 20
 
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
so that's what I provide you in terms of
 
00:29:12.909 --> 00:29:12.919 align:start position:0%
the rsas in this document and then I
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
follow that with these blue and gray um
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
charts these are actually charts that
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
come out of the dr's 2020 annual report
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
and that provides you a history of the
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
Inception of the tax all the way through
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh the most recent um completed year
 
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
2020 so you can read all the changes
 
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
that have occurred and find a historical
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
context for that if if you choose to do
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
do so so again there's a lot of
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
information there you're going to hear
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
from the agencies you're going to get a
 
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
lot more information
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
um I just want you to know my role is to
 
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
assist you with any questions you might
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
have so as you look at things and you're
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
wondering um well I don't understand
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
where this tax you know came from or
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
who's paying for that you can reach out
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%

Team here today I spoke to all of you
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
for quite a while last week so um I
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
decided to break things up today you'll
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
get to hear from all of us um as we move
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
through the presentation we're going to
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
go through each of the major taxes that
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
the Dr collects give you the background
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
on that um we will then um at the end
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
give some initial Revenue estimates for
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 and some ranges for 22
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
and 23 and last but not least I'm going
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
to give everyone an update on our new
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue information management system
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
Lindsay do you want to go through the
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
presentation first and then questions um
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
I think you know it worked really well
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
last week where we stopped at the end of
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
each tax and addressed any questions um
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
relevant to that tax type then so I
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
think we'll probably follow that same um
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
process if that works for you Mr chair
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:41.799 align:start position:0%
you okay so first just the mission of
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue um our mission
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%

confidence in our integrity further we
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%

and how we came up with our um fiscal
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
impact analysis and we certainly hope
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%

at the end of the session um we'll set
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
forth with task of implementing all of
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
the tax law changes that you might pass
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
Lindsay um this slide is just a quick
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
tool um to let you know all of the taxes
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the department
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
administers um it lists the tax the
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
current rate as well as the statute that
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
implements the the tax and then below
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
you'll know there's a short list of the
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
taxes we don't administer um but often
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
do get inquiries about the insurance
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
premium tax which is administered by the
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Insurance although we do
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
get data about the IP um because it does
 
00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
um act as a credit against business
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
taxes um the beer tax and then the road
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
toll which Chris talked about um is the
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
and then here is all of the taxes that
 
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.870 align:start position:0%
and then here is all of the taxes that
we

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
administer with the fiscal year 2020
 
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
audited Revenue um totaling
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
2.3 billion
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
dollar and the nfq met and railroad tax
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
are un audited cash um just to note
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
there but moving on to the next slide
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
think this is particularly an
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
interesting visual to help you visualize
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
um the proportion of Revenue that each
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
tax makes up so if you take a look at
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
for example the business profits tax
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
which is in sort of a dark blue and then
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
the bu business Enterprise tax in purple
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
you can see that business taxes are
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
greater than a quarter of all taxes that
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
the department administers um followed
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
up by the property tax and the meals and
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
rentals tax um All Above 10% of total
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
revenue and then some of the smaller
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
taxes um less than 10% so in this
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
presentation and in a lot of our
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
presentations before you um we'll spend
 
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of time talking about business
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
taxes and rightly so because it makes up
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
um a good proportion of the total taxes
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.030 align:start position:0%
 
collect

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
collect
 
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
and now I think we're going to hand it
 
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
over to Melissa Rollins and Devin rodri
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
analysts good morning so we're going to
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
start with business profits tax this tax
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
is under RSA
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
77a it's
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
louder the tax is
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
77 % of taxal business profits for
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
periods ending December 31st hey Brad
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
volume I'm not able to if they're on
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
their computer you have to go into their
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
volume Melissa would help if you could
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
volume how about now can you hear me
 
00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
now better could be
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
better okay let me start over for
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
business profits tax it's under RSA
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
77a it's 7.7% of taxable business
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
profits for tax period ending on or
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
after 1231
 
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
2019 so our current rate is the
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
7.7% who's taxable every Enterprise
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
Organization for gain or profit turning
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
on any business activity within the
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
state the threshold for the business
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
profits tax is gross business income in
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
excess of 50,000 from all
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
activities and then on the right where
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
when to file this is for calendar year
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
filers Chris chatted about this earlier
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
so partnership returns are due March 15
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
corporate prorip and fiduciary returns
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
are due April
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
15 and then there's also a 7-month
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
extension to file so this is an
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
extension to file and not pay so the
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
payment for these returns with the
 
00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:14.119 align:start position:0%
extension is due by the return due date
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
which I stated
 
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
above and then lastly our estimate
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
payments so estimate payments for the
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
business profits tax are equal to 25% of
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
estimated tax liability and and are due
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
for a calendar year filers April 15th
 
00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
June 15th so the first two payments are
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
due in the um the end of a fiscal year
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then September 15 and December 15th
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
for this third and fourth quarter
 
00:43:44.349 --> 00:43:44.359 align:start position:0%
estimates and those estimate payments
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
are required if an estimate liability
 
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.069 align:start position:0%
are required if an estimate liability
exceeds

00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
$200 moving on to the next
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
slide this information is pulled from
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
our triangles which is on the the
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
following slide but it's a really good
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
representation of our BP
 
00:44:03.549 --> 00:44:03.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so for tax year
 
00:44:03.559 --> 00:44:05.190 align:start position:0%
taxpayers so for tax year
2018

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
1.4% of filers paid 85% of
 
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
BPT and then the next two charts below
 
00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:16.839 align:start position:0%
are showing who's filing and versus
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
who's paying so what's interesting about
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
this slide is on the left you'll see
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
that the largest amount of entities that
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
are filing business profits tax are
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
proprietorships at 41% however looking
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
on to the right they only make up 3% of
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
what is paid for
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
BPT and then to switch back over to
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
who's filing 6% of Water's Edge or
 
00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.750 align:start position:0%
who's filing 6% of Water's Edge or
combined

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
combined
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
filers are filing the tax but they
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
represent 62% of what is being paid
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
tax and then on the next slide this is
 
00:44:58.630 --> 00:44:58.640 align:start position:0%
the the triangles representative major
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
you allude to these a bit these are
 
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
located in our annual report this is who
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
pays the business profits tax um and on
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
the top you'll see sort of that inverted
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
triangle and that breaks out tax
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
reported on the business profits tax and
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
then it has c c files the amount that
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
they pay and then it's um some
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
percentages based on that and what's
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
interesting with the business profits
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
tax if you look at that lower smaller
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
portion of the triangle around 600
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
filers pay almost 80% of the business
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
profits St so just an interesting slide
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
paying and then this slide is the BBT
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
revenue and the 10-year
 
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:53.079 align:start position:0%
Trend this is audited Revenue so when we
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
refer to audited Revenue that's coming
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
out of the Capper Chris talked about the
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive annual report um on here
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
we have the 10-year Trend in the blue
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
and then we have fiscal year 21 plan
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
with a dotted green line on the right we
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
also give you a historical view of the
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
bbp tax rates over the
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
years what's important to know on
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
business profits tax is some factors
 
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
that influence the revenue this is
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
located at the bottom of the slide the
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
economy federal tax reform mergers and
 
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
economy federal tax reform mergers and
acquisitions

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
acquisitions
 
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
credits and exemptions and then
 
00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.589 align:start position:0%
credits and exemptions and then
statutory

00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
changes so for instance the business tax
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
rate reduction the trigger was not met
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:43.559 align:start position:0%
7.7% and then we also have Market based
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
sourcing in effect for tax will periods
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 31st
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
2021 as well as single sales Factor
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
apportionment for tax will periods
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 31st
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
2022 so give a little bit more
 
00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:04.119 align:start position:0%
information about market-based
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
sourcing so for business profits when
 
00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
they are reported prior to being taxed
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
they're a portion so portion portion is
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
split into two pieces so we have
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
intangible sales and services so we
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
switched from cost of performance where
 
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
those intangible sales and services were
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
portioned based on where Services were
 
00:47:26.359 --> 00:47:27.390 align:start position:0%
portioned based on where Services were
perform

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
perform
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we switched now to Market based
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
sourcing and that's where those tangible
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
excuse me those intangible sales and
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
services are now portioned to where the
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
End customer is located so that's the
 
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
first change that just went into effect
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then the second change that will be
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
going into effect for taxable periods
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 31st 2022 is
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
for tangible items So currently we use a
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
three Factor apportionment meaning sales
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
property and payroll with sale with
 
00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:02.359 align:start position:0%
sales being devil weighted are how the
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
tangible items are a portioned and when
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
we switch to single sales factor that
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
means only sales will be factored in and
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
a portioned and will no longer include
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
payroll in
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
property and I think that's it for
 
00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:20.359 align:start position:0%
business profits tax before we move on
 
00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
to business Enterprise tax so I'm happy
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.309 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
here

00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh let me

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
list you just need to click the um
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
participants button at the bottom of the
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
screen I'm going to the bottom of the

screen I'm going to the bottom of the
screen

00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
I share okay here we
 
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.589 align:start position:0%
I share okay here we
go

00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%

00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
out okay if anybody has any questions if
 
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
they would raise their hands and if they
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
screen and I don't see any questions at
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
Perfect all right business business
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax this is the second tax
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
that makes up our total business taxes
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
the business Enterprise tax is under RSA
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
77p the current tax rate is
 
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
0.6% of the Enterprise Value tax base
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
for tax will periods ending on or after
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
December 31st
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
2019 when we say Enterprise Value tax
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
base that consists of compensation wages
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
paid or approved as well as interest
 
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
paid or approved who PID this tax every
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
profit or nonprofit Enterprise or
 
00:50:02.589 --> 00:50:02.599 align:start position:0%
organization with any business activity
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
inside New Hampshire except 501c3
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
organizations the thresholds on the
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax are a little bit
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
different than the business profits tax
 
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
as they are adjusted by CPI every two
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
years so currently for tax bill periods
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
ending January 1
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
2021 gross business receipts in excess
 
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
2021 gross business receipts in excess
of

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
220,000 or Enterprise Value tax base
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
greater than
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
111,000 so the business Enterprise tax
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
has two different thresholds um and
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
either or need to be
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
met also important to note is the credit
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
for business Enterprise tax against
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
there's a credit for the business
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax against the business
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
profits tax due so if you pay the
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and also have a
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
liability on the business profits tax
 
00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
you deduct what you paid for business
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
of in this tax is also carry forward any
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
unused credit for 10 years and then when
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
to file or pay the business profits tax
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
and the business Enterprise tax come in
 
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
on the same return with a sort of a
 
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
cover sheet that's called the BT summary
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
and so the due dates for the Enterprise
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
tax mirror the due dates for the
 
00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
business profits tax with the exception
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
of nonprofits who are not required to
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
fire the business profits tax those are
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
15 all right this slide should look
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
familiar to you except it's for the
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax and it's
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
slightly different you'll see that 3.9%
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
of filers pay
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
73.9% of that so it's spread out a
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more however some of the
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
trends are the same again proprietor
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
ships are filing more yet they're paying
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
only 7% of the tax and again wat's Edge
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
are filing 6% but they're paying 53% of
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
tax going on to the next so the
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
triangles again this is in our annual
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
report um pretty similar except I'm
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
looking at that bottom of the triangle
 
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
again and 268 taxpayers pay 43% of the
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
tax so not quite as drastic as the
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
tax moving on and here is the business
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
Enterprise Revenue 10-year Trend again
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
you can see some dips and some spikes um
 
00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
factors influen the business Enterprise
 
00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
tax are the economic cycle including
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
employment levels and wages which makes
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
sense because it's taxed on wages and
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
compensation federal tax reform credits
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
and exemptions and then any statutory
 
00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
changes which for the business
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax was the business tax rate
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
which again the trigger was not met and
 
00:52:59.470 --> 00:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
then the adjustment of the thresholds
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
years and then here is a combined slide
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
so again we typically report the BET and
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
BPT together um it just makes sense
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
because they kind of go hand inand and
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
they flow together on one return so this
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
just shows the trend with them together
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
as well as the fiscal year 21 plan and
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
again you can see some Peaks which are
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
and some of those areas are due to some
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
mergers and Acquisitions and some
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
anomalous payments and then we sort of
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
dip down some 16 you see it Peaks up
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
because of those situations that I just
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
stated it drops back down in 17 which
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
would sort of have been the trend if it
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
continued and then in 18 and 19 You See
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
It Peak back up and that's due to some
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
federal tax reform and then it's dropped
 
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
slide so this is just an interesting
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
slide to keep handy um I know there's a
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
lot of information on it but what we
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
really wanted to show on this slide is
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
how calendar year filers compared to
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year filers because it can
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
get a little bit confusing when
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
listening to our fiscal notes and the
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact because they don't
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily align so in the top chart
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
you can see on the left hand side that
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
2019 returns that were due fall outside
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
of fiscal year 21 and then when you
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
shift to to the right hand side on this
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
top box for calend year filers you'll
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
see that third quarter estimate payments
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
as well as 2019 Returns on extension in
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
the fourth quarter estimate payments
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
fall within the first half of fiscal
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
year 21 so essentially what it shows is
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
that tax years overlap fiscal years so
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
in a fiscal year you have mult multiple
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
tax years flowing into one fiscal year
 
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:01.640 align:start position:0%
and you can see that on the bottom that
 
00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:02.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:08.680 align:start position:0%
2021 is made up of 2019 as well as 2020
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
returns and the um 2021 estimate
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
payments so when we're when they're
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
implementing tax laws those tax laws May
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
and are typically for calendar years but
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
they do impact multiple fiscal years so
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
just a good chart to have handy when
 
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about calendar year and
 
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.990 align:start position:0%
we're talking about calendar year and
fiscal

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
slide and I'm going to go through the
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
next couple of slides fairly quickly
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
because you're you should be familiar
 
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
with them because Lindsay had talked
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
about them in the previous um
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
presentation so this one again is just
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
showing the impact of our diff different
 
00:55:52.589 --> 00:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
payment type so we have tax return
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
payments estimate payments extension
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
payments and then tax notice payment and
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
refunds and I think what's important to
 
00:56:01.870 --> 00:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
note on this slide is that estimates
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
make up the bulk of the payments that
 
00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
are coming in and it shows a good trend
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
of of how those payments flow in and how
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
they contract andand for
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
decrease the next slide this just breaks
 
00:56:17.029 --> 00:56:17.039 align:start position:0%
down business tax estimates uh just
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
shows the entities that pay the
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
estimates um and the bulk of estimates
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
that come in the bulk of the revenue is
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
from corporations and then Partnerships
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
proprietorships with a small amount
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
slide all right I think that's it for
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
business taxes are there any questions
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
if not we can move to meals and rooms
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
tax I question nor Miss Pat I for some
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
reason I have a question please I know
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
my hand I my my my raised hand icon
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't work mine doesn't either it's
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
true for me too oh okay we were trying
 
00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.799 --> 00:57:14.309 align:start position:0%
 
Brad

00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
Brad because what'll happen everybody
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
wants to talk at once
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
and representative major U I was on the
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
other line um why is it that raise hand
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.789 align:start position:0%
 
work

00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:36.799 align:start position:0%
okay should um who's trying to raise
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
their hand um representative Ronney is
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
them was Ames and Tucker as well that I
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
heard it should be at the bottom of
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
their screen or it could be at the
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
bottom of the participants list I know
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
because someone sharing their screen
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
need to go up to view options and then
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
select um exit full screen oh wait a
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
minute view
 
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
option excuse me it doesn't seem to be
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
on the screen at all there's just invite
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
me well they have a raised hand it just
 
00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't work yeah because it's in full
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
screen you need to select view options
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
at the top of the screen and then and
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
then select exit full screen and it will
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
up here at the bottom of your screen the
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
responding maybe we can just hold up our
 
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
hands while I figure this for some
 
00:58:41.029 --> 00:58:41.039 align:start position:0%
reason it worked for me but I'm a
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
co-host so po represent Galo do you can
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
you help us out on this I I don't know
 
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:53.240 align:start position:0%
any I I know it's working for me as you
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
can see but what I'm find not to
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
interrupt but what I'm finding is if you
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
go to the participants click on that
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
click on the
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
panelists and then you'll have the
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
option that's the only way I'm getting
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.630 align:start position:0%
 
responding

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
hello I just shot a email to Lindsay I

showing and I don't want to raise my
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
hand yeah because it's a disaster we
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
can't have dysfunction
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
working because we don't see
 
00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
any have the screen shared you don't see
 
00:59:50.589 --> 00:59:50.599 align:start position:0%

hand guess if we're in if we're in this
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
mode we can just raise our hands like
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
this Norm just and you can pick them
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
right I only see you and about four
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
others you got to go to full screen you
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
gallery I think they at least come up to
 
01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:00.200 align:start position:0%
the top of the list if you want to look
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
at the four that are at the top maybe
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay why don't we do
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
list is representative
 
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
Tucker so representative Tucker thank
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
you I have a question about the slide
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
that talks about the floor that's
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
established for the business Enterprise
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
tax and uh does that change very
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
often has it changed very often the
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
amount yes great question representative
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
Tucker can you guys hear me better now
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
oh yes all right I I was able to make
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
some changes while you had some
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
discussion so thank you um so yeah so it
 
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
changes every two years and since it's
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
been in place it has increased every two
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
years so I think for the last six years
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
or so um it's adjusted so it's every two
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
so I think it's adjusted three times
 
01:02:01.549 --> 01:02:01.559 align:start position:0%
since being implemented so do you is it
 
01:02:01.559 --> 01:02:03.829 align:start position:0%
since being implemented so do you is it
fairly

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
fairly
 
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
incremental or a
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
percentage y so it's it's based on a lot
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
of time as a group talking about who
 
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
ought to be Exempted or who should have
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
things lowered but I hadn't really real
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
thought about that floor and how that
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
probably helps Mom and Pops Enterprises
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
and so forth so that's why I'm asking is
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
it uh sort of an automatic incremental
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
change or is it thoughtful to direct
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
itself to a
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
problem um I think it's s thoughtful
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's directed by the statute so there's
 
01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
a formula within the statute that
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
requires Dr to adjust it based on CPI
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
the average increase of CPI over the
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
last completed um calendar year so it's
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
it's based on the growth obviously in
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
the economy so that I think it's a
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
thoughtful um statute that's put in
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
there and it's it's very descriptive in
 
01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
telling Dr how to calculate the increase
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
repres representative bronley followed
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
by represen S yeah mine's more of a
 
01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
comment we when we were talking about
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
BPP when we were talking about Market
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
based sourcing and single sales Factor
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
there's I'm introducing a bill on
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
Thursday that we actually worked through
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
last year um on on both those issues
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
it's a very important issue it'll be the
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
last bill of of the day on Thursday and
 
01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:33.559 align:start position:0%
I think Dr will will also be there to be
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
part of this discussion thank you then
 
01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:42.789 align:start position:0%
part of this discussion thank you then
representative

01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
gor I do not have any yeah I don't have
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
a question okay the next one would be
 
01:03:49.559 --> 01:03:50.910 align:start position:0%
a question okay the next one would be
representative

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you um yeah this is a
 
01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
question about the division of revenues
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
between bet and
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
BBT and I wonder if you could run
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
through exactly how
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
you allocate the revenues between those
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
two taxes at what point can we know that
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a final
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
allocation what points is it an estimate
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you do
 
01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:23.799 align:start position:0%
it great question representative Ames so
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
the I'm going to explain how we were
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
historic Al doing it and then we've made
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
some changes recently so historically
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
the way the business Enterprise tax and
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
business profits tax is split is on we
 
01:04:38.349 --> 01:04:38.359 align:start position:0%
do it on a monthly basis but it's not
 
01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
based on the actual split that we are
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
familiar with with what the taxpayer
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
will be filing it's based on historical
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
numbers so for example when we're
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
getting estimate payments flowing into
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
the department on the
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
form it's split between bet and PPT
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
however most taxpayers just put the
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
total business tax that they're paying
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily split it out
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
between the two taxes because as I
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
stated before the Returns come in on one
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
form One summary form with the two taxes
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
below so most taxpayers view it as one
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
tax when they're paying their Enterprise
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
Value tax and their business profits
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
tax however we need to split this
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
between business profits tax and
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax because Chris
 
01:05:27.789 --> 01:05:27.799 align:start position:0%
spoke to it does get split separately
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
between the general fund and education
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
trust fund so typically this is done
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
based on the last completed fiscal year
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
or two years prior to the last completed
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so as of July 1st every year
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
the department sets the business profits
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
tax and Inter business Enterprise tax
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
split based on two prior fiscal
 
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
years so the split is then performed at
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
the end of every month to fully split
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
out those taxes so we always recommend
 
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
don't look at the BET and BPT amounts
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the month because they're
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
just flowing in and they're they're sort
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
of offset but when you get to the end of
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
the month we do a transfer to put the
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
funds into the appropriate count based
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
on that historical
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
split okay representative
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
Bernstein wait I don't think she's
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
finished yeah so I just wanted to add
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
one more piece so now because of the
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
implementation of rims so starting in
 
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
October we've been able to do a little
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
bit better job on that split so the
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
payments that come in that are
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
not split between bet and P BPT are
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
still based on historical amounts
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
however if they do come in with a split
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
we put them into the appropriate account
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
and then when you come in March and
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
April and those returns are filed those
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
returns will chew up those estimates
 
01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
that were based on historic split to be
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
the actual split so I think coming this
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
March and April it's the first time that
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to have true accurate splits
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
between bet and
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
BBT um based on the most recent data
 
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
received hopefully that makes sense it's
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
a lot to kind of throw out there thank
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome representative
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
Bernstein I I do not have a question
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
right now okay um repr Aly did you have
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
a question yes I was trying to figure
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
out since I'm at the top I don't know
 
01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
how whether I've managed to to ask or
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
not but um I'm I want to go back to what
 
01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker was asking about
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
because uh you and I were actually there
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
at the time it was during the O'Brien
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
Administration and on there was a bill
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
that came in to say that on the amount
 
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
of the floor should be doubled for the
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
BET and I thought that was awful and I
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
went and analyzed it and in fact the in
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
order to reach the same level after
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
inflation we did need to double it but
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
that was kind of a shock to the system
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
so I asked that we put in the CPI
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
indicator so that it would rise
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
gradually rather than all at once and uh
 
01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
they we did that all of us
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
but and so that's that's why that's in
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
there and it's kind of I think important
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
in tax policy the problem of floors
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you okay is there any others that
 
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
question s then we can
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
rs good morning chairman members of the
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
committee this is Devon rodri Financial
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
analy of the Department of Revenue can
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
everyone hear me okay uh yes yes great
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
so the meals and rentals tax is a 9% tax
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
on meals rooms and motor vehicle rentals
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
it is paid by the consumer and collected
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
and remitted by operators of hotels
 
01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants in motor vehicle rental
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
establishments etc for operators meeting
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
certain criteria like filing returns
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
timely and paying on time they are
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
allowed to retain a commission of
 
01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
3% return returns are filed monthly for
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R and are due by the 15th of each
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
following month as Chris Shay mentioned
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
earlier during December we received
 
01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
returns and payments for activity that
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
occurred in
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
November operators are able to file
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
electronically using Grant tax connect
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
our online taxpayer portal which went
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
live in October 2019 and Lindsay will go
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
later a paper return is not required if
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
um sorry one
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
second so the the gross meals and
 
01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
rentals tax liability reported by
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
activity type so from on average from
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2020
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
historically M&amp;R Revenue consists of 80%
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
meals 177% rooms and 3% motor vehicle
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
this has been pretty consistent over
 
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
time on the following slide we'll look
 
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
at this breakdown by county for fiscal
 
01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.669 align:start position:0%
at this breakdown by county for fiscal
year

01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
2020 the top portion of this slide shows
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
how much M&amp;R tax liability was reported
 
01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
in each County as well as how much each
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
County represents of all REM M&amp;R Revenue
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
collected Statewide the chart is
 
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
organized left to right based on how
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
much was reported in fiscal year
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
2020 it's important to note at this
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
point as it relates to the data on this
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
slide that the Dr does not collect
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
information on exactly where M&amp;R tax
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
revenue is generated rather the data in
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
these charts represents the revenue
 
01:10:59.229 --> 01:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
collected based on the address of the
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
operator the reporting location is often
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
different than the location where the
 
01:11:05.669 --> 01:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
taxable transaction occurred in where
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R tax was actually collected many M&amp;R
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
operators for example file their Returns
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
on a Consolidated basis meaning the
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
operator reports am our tax collected
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
from several business locations on a
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
single return another example might be
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
mobile businesses who may be collecting
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
tax throughout the throughout the state
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
on different different counties
 
01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
the lower portion of this slide answers
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
a question from the last presentation by
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker who was interested
 
01:11:34.310 --> 01:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
in the breakdown by County remember from
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
the previous Slide the Statewide
 
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
breakdown is on average is 80% meal 177%
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
rooms and 3% motor
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle this chart is organized you can
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
see in the blue column from left to
 
01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
right Which counties have a higher
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
percentage of meals
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
activity you'll notice that the counties
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
to the far right the first of three of
 
01:11:56.189 --> 01:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
which are from the north country have a
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
much higher percentage of rooms than the
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide average for example Coos
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
County being 47% of rooms versus a
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide average of just
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
17% and likewise all the way to the left
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
straford county has only %. this really
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
speaks to the differences in the types
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
state the next
 
01:12:24.910 --> 01:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
slide this is the familiar 10year trend
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
of audited Revenue per the caffer um
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see the the trend for the past 10
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
years in the blue line and you'll notice
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
the dip in FY
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
2020 factors influenced M&amp;R tax include
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
covid-19 as can be seen in the chart
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
above um when the econom is thriving M&amp;R
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
tax revenue is usually increasing
 
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates also affect this tax
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
by weighing down consumer spending the
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
weather also plays a factor and
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
correlates with travel and tourism which
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
was obviously affected during the last
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
year generally favorable weather
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
conditions during the summer and winter
 
01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
can positively affect M&amp;R as well as
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
strong foliage
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
seasons are there any questions on the
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
M&amp;R tax at this
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
questions we'll try this participant
 
01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.070 align:start position:0%
questions we'll try this participant
list

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
again I don't see any hands raised but
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
um if you do have a question just Pi up
 
01:13:28.270 --> 01:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
and see if we can do it pat um just a
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
clarifying thing for the new members
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
just to make sure when they say 3% goes
 
01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:35.719 align:start position:0%
to the uh organization col collecting
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
the revenue that's 3% of what's
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
collected not 3% of the 9% sometimes it
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
could be a little confusing but it's
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
confused and that total amount for
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2020 was 9 million across
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
State this is on Sue I guess we're on
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
first name at the moment uh on the the
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
3% is meant to compensate for the
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
administrative costs of collecting our
 
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
tax and sending it in and they're much
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
higher than that I think for the
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
smallest Enterprises and lower than that
 
01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:23.719 align:start position:0%
for the chains
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
cost and the in the past there's been
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
legislation to eliminate this to raise
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
our Revenue but it's never gotten
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere and I I think it works okay the
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
way it
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
is and no other questions and we can
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
tax

01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.149 --> 01:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
uh who's speaking on the tobacco tax I
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
think it's Melissa Melissa are you
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
taking I yes I was on mute I
 
01:15:08.189 --> 01:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
apologize all right tobacco tax this is
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
78 this one is made up of a couple
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
different components so for one portion
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
of the tax it's based on stamp so it's a
 
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
$1.78 per pack of 20 cigarettes or
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
$223 per pack of 25 cigarettes and then
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
the other portion of the tobacco tax is
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
the other tobacco products or OTP as we
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
refer to them and those are 65.0 3% of
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
the wholesale sales price for all other
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
tobacco products except ecigarettes
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
for ecigarettes I believe Lindsay
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
covered this in the the last
 
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
presentation ecigarette tax went into
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
effect on January 1st of last year it's
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
levied on both the closed system and
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
open system and is reported on the OTP
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
return the closed system tax is a rate
 
01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.990 align:start position:0%
return the closed system tax is a rate
of

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
0.3 Z per aill liter on the volume of
 
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
the liquid of other substance containing
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
nicotine in the cartridge or container
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
and the other in the open system is 8%
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
of the wholesale price of the container
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
of liquid or other substance so again
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's the 30 cents per milliliter on um
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
for the closed systems and then 8% on
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
the wholesale price of the container of
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
liquid for the open systems it's
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
important to note premium cigars are
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
exempt from the tobacco tax the tax on
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco products is a direct tax upon
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
the consumer at retail but it's prepaid
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
or excuse me pre-collected and paid by
 
01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:48.350 align:start position:0%
or excuse me pre-collected and paid by
the

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
wholesaler for packs of 20 or 25
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
cigarettes payment of the tax is
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the wholesaler's purchase
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
of tobacco tax stamps which are fixed to
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
each package so essentially the
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
wholesaler comes to the department buys
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
the stamps for the cigarettes they pay
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
the tax at that point they put the stamp
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
on the package of the cigarettes those
 
01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
are then sold to the
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
retailers and who are then passed on the
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
consumer and the consumer is paying it
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
within the price however it's initially
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
paid by the
 
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
wholesaler so for cigarette sold in in
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
packages or quantities other than than
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
20 or 25 not suitable for stamping and
 
01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
for OTP the other tobacco products which
 
01:17:33.629 --> 01:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
is essentially loose tobacco or chewing
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
tobacco um the wholesaler must be
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
reported and and pay the tax liability
 
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
on the monthly basis this is paid
 
01:17:43.590 --> 01:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
similar to the M&amp;R tax the return and
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
payment of the tax are due honor before
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
the 15th day of the month following the
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
end of the reporting period and then
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
just the last piece of this that is
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
important to note because it's in our
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
reports as well
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
stamps may be purchased on a bond filed
 
01:18:00.149 --> 01:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
with the department so meaning these
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
wholesalers receive a bond they purchase
 
01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
their stamp on Bond and then they have
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
30 days to pay that Bond off so some of
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
the tobacco stamps are paid with cash
 
01:18:12.669 --> 01:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
and others are paid on bond which is
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
received 30 days
 
01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
later uh next
 
01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
slide so for tobacco tax for fiscal year
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
16 to fiscal year 20 on average tobacco
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
tax Revenue were composed primarily of
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
cigarette stamps sales so that's 94% of
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
the revenue is coming from cigarettes
 
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
and then 6% is coming from OTP and
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see on future slides that the OTP
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
portion of the tobacco tax although
 
01:18:43.149 --> 01:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
small has continued to grow um pretty
 
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
regularly over each
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
year in this breakdown again um you had
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
seen in Prior presentations but we
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to sort of put it all into one
 
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
place this is the tobacco stamp Revenue
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
what it looks like and you can see that
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
the Peaks and Valley sort of cor
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
correspond with the rate increase and
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
decrease that are to the
 
01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
left and then
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
OTP this is a chart that you've seen
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
before but again as I spoke to you can
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
see that the percentage or the dollars
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
of OTP have pretty consistently gained
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
year over-year with fiscal year 20 being
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
the highest so far and the rates are on
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
well so for tobacco tax revenue this is
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
the 10-year Trend you can see that it's
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
kind of increased and decreased we show
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
some rates to help follow those
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
increases and decreases over the year
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
you can see that fiscal year 21 plan um
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
is close to what fiscal year 19 audited
 
01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue ended at and you can see fiscal
 
01:19:54.910 --> 01:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
year 20 um has been performing Pretty
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
well as well as that trend is continuing
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
through fiscal year
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
21 factors that influence that revenue
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
is crossborder elasticity ecigarettes
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
stamp sales Trend as well as again
 
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
Lindsay spoke about this in the last
 
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
presentation presentation the
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts band on mental products
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
that went into effect June 1st 2020 um
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
we've seen a pretty big gain in fiscal
 
01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:20.229 align:start position:0%
we've seen a pretty big gain in fiscal
year

01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
change so this is a newer slide but we
 
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
found it to be interesting based on some
 
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
of the questions that the
 
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
representatives had during the um
 
01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
economic briefing presentation what this
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
shows on the left is tobacco tax rates
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
by state so this has the tax rate per a
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
pack um so New Hampshire's a178
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
highlighted in blue and we rank 26th for
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
the um highest level or lowest level
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
however you want to say it for tax rates
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
and then these are our nearby States and
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
you can see they increase pretty dramat
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
dramatically from Maine being the
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
closest to us at $2 per a pack with New
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
York being the highest at 435 per pack
 
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
so this does show that there is a
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
pretty a pretty good um range between
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
what we have assessed versus what our
 
01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
our local New England states have
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
assessed and then on the right
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
um just some more interesting
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
facts the the ranking of smuggled
 
01:21:33.030 --> 01:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
cigarettes consumed as a percentage of
 
01:21:37.149 --> 01:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
total cigarettes consumed in 20 2018
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
both of these informations are not Dr
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
informations I should have stated that
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
in the beginning um this is from tax
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation we have the lowest rate of
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
smuggle cigarettes consumed as a
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of total consumed within the
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
state so we rank 47 so way down of the
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
amount of smuggled cigarettes into New
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are consumed um sort of
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
the inverse of this is we have we are
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
one of the highest um states that are
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
rate and I think that is it for the
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax slide so happy to answer any
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay any questions on the
 
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.590 align:start position:0%
questions okay any questions on the

um rent major could I ask uh
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%

01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
rate include the sales tax which I think
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
all of them put on top no great question
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative alme I should have stated
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%

catch so m i I think as what about 6%
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
tax yeah making that even a larger range
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%

01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%

at a rate of 75 cents per $100 of the
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
price or consideration for sale granting
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
or transfer on both the buyer and the
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
seller on each
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
transaction red is paid by buying stamps
 
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
which are fixed to the deed from the
 
01:24:20.550 --> 01:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
register of deeds in the county where
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
the property is
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
located um each Register of Deeds remits
 
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
the taxes collected to the Dr on a
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and it retains 4% of the
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
face value of the stamp sold in the
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
county in real estate holding company
 
01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:35.560 align:start position:0%
transactions the taxes remitted directly
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
slide this chart shows the average
 
01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of transactions and
 
01:24:48.109 --> 01:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of overall tax collected Per
 
01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
County in fiscal year
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
2020 it's interesting to note the trends
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
are not always the same for instance
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
Grafton County had 14.4% of the
 
01:25:00.189 --> 01:25:00.199 align:start position:0%
transactions but only represented about
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
6.4% of the
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
revenue conversely at the same time
 
01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County had
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
19.8% of the number of
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
transactions and represented 28.7% of
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
the revenue collected
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
Statewide so this is here for your
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
slide here you'll see the familiar
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
10-year audited Revenue Trend per the
 
01:25:26.669 --> 01:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
caffer the current um r tax rate like I
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
explained a minute ago in total $150 per
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
100 um dollars the price of
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
consideration of transfer which includes
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
both the purchaser and the seller that
 
01:25:38.470 --> 01:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
was in effect throughout this time frame
 
01:25:39.870 --> 01:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
so you can see the r tax has been
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
gradually increasing over the last 10
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
years it is influenced by Eon economic
 
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
Trends including mortgage interest rates
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
which are currently at historically low
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
levels property values obviously heavily
 
01:25:53.910 --> 01:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
influence R Revenue as we've seen over
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
the last
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
year a couple figures from the New
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire realtors association the
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
median sales price in December 2020 was
 
01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
up 16.6% for single family homes from
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
the previous December and uh Townhouse
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
Condo properties are up 23 a. half% from
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
a year ago available inventory of real
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
estate for sale also influences this tax
 
01:26:18.109 --> 01:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
again as of December inventory had
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
decreased 62% for single family homes
 
01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
and 47% for Townhouse Condo properties
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
from a year
 
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
prior lastly over the last year there's
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
been a continued shift in demographics
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
from Urban to more rural areas as many
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
people being to shift away from the more
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
um heavily populated densities which
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
will help increase net migration in
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh presumably have a positive
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
influence on the real estate transfer
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
tax we've seen that over the last
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
year are there any questions on the real
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
estate transfer
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
tax okay
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
up don't see hear anybody so we'll go on
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
to interest and dividend
 
01:27:06.870 --> 01:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
tax all right interest and dividends tax
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
this is under RSA 77 it's a 5% tax on
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
interest in dividend dividends income
 
01:27:15.390 --> 01:27:15.400 align:start position:0%
who pays it is all New Hampshire
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
residents fiduciaries llc's Partnerships
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
and associations with income from
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends the threshold for
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
this tax is 20 400 annually or if you
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
file jointly it's 4,800 there's also an
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
exemption with this tax of 1,200 for
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
residents age 65 or older blind or
 
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
disabled before their 65th
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
birthday this this tax is due on April
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
15th this tax also has a seven-month
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
extension similar to the business
 
01:27:48.510 --> 01:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
profits and business Enterprise tax
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
which is due April 15th with the return
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
being due 7 months
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
later and and it also has estimate
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
requirements so the estimates equal to
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
25% of estimated tax liability the due
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
dates are April 15th June 15th September
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
15th which those fall in line with the
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
business taxes however the fourth
 
01:28:11.669 --> 01:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
quarter estimate payment for interest in
 
01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:14.119 align:start position:0%
dividends tax is due January 15th of the
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent year so this month is an indd
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
estimate tax month for their fourth
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
quarter estimate payment and they're
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
only required to make estimates if their
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
$500 so again we have some pictures of
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
how IND taxpayers file for tax year
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
2018 on the left we have entities paying
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
98.3% of the filers for interest in
 
01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
dividends tax are individuals and Joint
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
filers with the remaining
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
1.7% for Partnerships in Estates and
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
then we have a little comment below
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
where the entities that are uh filing
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
the tax the above is paying um is pretty
 
01:29:05.229 --> 01:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
similar with
 
01:29:07.629 --> 01:29:07.639 align:start position:0%
97 point actually it's basically the
 
01:29:12.109 --> 01:29:12.119 align:start position:0%
same 97.3 and then 2. 66 for
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
Partnerships in estimates what's
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
interesting on this slide on the right
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
is interest in dividends tax broken down
 
01:29:22.189 --> 01:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
by the areas of what is taxed so
 
01:29:23.270 --> 01:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
although it's called interest in
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
dividends tax there are a few other
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
items that make up this tax with
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
interest being
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
133% of the tax dividends being 40% of
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
the taxed federal tax exempt interest is
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
7.7% or 8% of the tax and then there's
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
distributions and distributions about
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
39% of the tax this does shift over the
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
years um and especially I think you
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
would you would note that interest does
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease based on what the
 
01:29:58.229 --> 01:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
interest rate is
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
at on the next slide we have the
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
triangles again that are from our annual
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
report not as exciting as the business
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
profits tax and business Enterprise tax
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
triangles you'll see in the middle here
 
01:30:17.109 --> 01:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
um 40% of the tax is paid by about
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
23% of the people filing so this tax is
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
split out a little bit more evenly than
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
the business profit and business
 
01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.709 align:start position:0%
the business profit and business
Enterprise

01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
Enterprise
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
tax on the next slide we have interest
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
and dividends tax revenue for the
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
10-year Trend you'll see over the prior
 
01:30:36.750 --> 01:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
earlier years on this tax there's some
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
peaks in valleys and then for the last
 
01:30:42.590 --> 01:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
four or five years it's consistently
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
increased some factors that can that
 
01:30:47.470 --> 01:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
influence this revenue is obviously the
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
economy stock market performance
 
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
interest rates federal tax reform or
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
people who have money in the
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
bank happy to answer any questions on
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
the indd
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
tax okay any questions on the indd
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
tax since we the raiseed hand function
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
isn't working um let's try just picking
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
up and it's representative Aly
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
again I I must admit I don't really
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
understand what a distribution
 
01:31:25.390 --> 01:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
is can you clarify by that I don't think
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
we looked at this until a few years
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
ago sure so distributions um an example
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
of a distribution would be a
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
distribution from maybe an LLC or a
 
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
partnership or an association would be
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax so if they pay that
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
distribution out to a corporate
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
shareholder um it would be tax as a
 
01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
dividend but if they are paying it out
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
um to an individual it's a distri bution
 
01:31:56.189 --> 01:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
so it's split a little bit differently
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
dividend Caroline or lindsy you can feel
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
clarification okay uh anything else on
 
01:32:16.109 --> 01:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
questions s not we can go over to the
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
communication Services
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
tax the communication services tax or
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
CST is a 7% tax on all two-way
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
communication Services it's paid by the
 
01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
consumer and collected by two-way
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
Communication service providers who are
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
required to collect and tax collect the
 
01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
tax and file a return those returns are
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
due on the 15th day of the following
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
month however estimate payments are
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
required during each month if the tax
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:55.719 align:start position:0%
slide here's the 10-year Trend again of
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
audited Revenue it's important to note
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
that in 2012 chapter 279 added
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
definitions of internet and internet
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
access and excluded them from the
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
definition of communication
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
Services also over time there's a
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
decrease in landlines which has
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
contributed to a decrease in the revenue
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
as well as modern pricing and purchasing
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
trends for w Wireless
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
Communications and lastly hb4 of 2019
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
clarified that retailers a pre paid
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
Wireless and VOIP must assess and
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
CST there any questions about
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
CST questions on communication Services
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
tax have to speak up
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
again representative elme again could
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
you tell us whether you're having
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
success in getting the VoIP and video
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
pay good question
 
01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna refer to Lindsay and
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
Carolyn I'll jump in there I think I
 
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned last week that we were looking
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
into that um and we will be doing some
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
auditing and some proactive Outreach
 
01:34:08.669 --> 01:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
obviously it's only been a few days
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
since that time so that process is still
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
underway thank you sorry no worri just a
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
followup on that
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
has have you uh interfaced at all with a
 
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
zoom organization
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
ation um I can't talk about any
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
interactions with specific taxpayers
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately given um our
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
confidentiality statutes but obviously
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
the zoom platform is a very well-known
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
um video conferencing platform so um
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
they we are aware of the uh
 
01:34:43.870 --> 01:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
functionality that they
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
provide okay followup question on that
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
is how about any platform that performs
 
01:34:54.669 --> 01:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
this have you interfaced with
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
so obviously there are multiple
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
platforms um Zoom the state uses
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
Microsoft teams we've also used utilized
 
01:35:05.470 --> 01:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
the WebEx platform um and so again those
 
01:35:09.629 --> 01:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
are all um taxpayers or businesses that
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
um we would be looking to in terms of um
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
determining whether or not they owe
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
communication services do you know do
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
you know if any other states have
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
collected from them I'm not aware
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
specifically of any other state it would
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
depend on their specific um tax uh
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
policies and if they had an equivalent
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax I'm not I'm
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
not sure if other states have a similar
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
tax okay so we have some work to do we
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
do and I mentioned that last week that
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is something that we are
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
aware of and that we are looking
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
into all right any for questions or
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
comments on the communication Services
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
tax see hearing none we can go to the
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid enhancement
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
tax all right Medicaid enhancement tax
 
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as met this is under RSA
 
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
84A this tax is a little bit different
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
as it is a restricted Revenue source so
 
01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
this isn't a tax that you estimate
 
01:36:14.910 --> 01:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
revenues on um but we do administer it
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
so we want to cover it so the Medicaid
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax is 5.4% tax upon net
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
Patient Service revenue of Hospital it's
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
paid by General hospitals that provide
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
inpatient and outpatient hospital
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
services and not including government
 
01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:31.629 align:start position:0%
services and not including government
facil

01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
facil
 
01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
facilities the way this is taxed and the
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
reporting period is a little bit
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
different than our other periods the tax
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
period for mat is a 12-month period
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
running on a fiscal year July 1st ending
 
01:36:45.669 --> 01:36:45.679 align:start position:0%
June 30th and the tax due is based on
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
the hospital's fiscal year ending during
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
the calendar year in which the tax bill
 
01:36:52.910 --> 01:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
period begin so just as an example right
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
now we
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
in the Met tax will period ending June
 
01:37:00.629 --> 01:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
30th 2021 and that will be reported for
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals period end dates that ended in
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
2020 so how met is filed and paid one
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
difference with met is that each
 
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hospital must file a nonbinding estimate
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
honored before January 15th and this is
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
a projected tax payment so it's just an
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
informational estimate payment that
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
tells us what they anticipate their tax
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
to be due when the return is due in
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
April 15th so in April 15th they file
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
return on the next
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
slide we have a picture of met
 
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
historical revenue or their historical
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
Trends and this is cash basis net of
 
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
refunds so you can see that it has
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
gradually increased and uh fiscal year
 
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
20 is fiscal year 21 plan is close to
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 ual revenue and Below we
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
have some of the rates over the previous
 
01:37:59.950 --> 01:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
years and then lastly factors that
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
influence revenue is obviously Hospital
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
service utilization the more people in
 
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
the hospital the more tax that is is
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
paid and then the last slide that we
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
have for met is just to give you our
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
role in The Met administration because
 
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different where it's a
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
dual role between Dr and DHHS so the
 
01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals file the non-binding estimate
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
with us on January 15th so we just
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
received most of those estimates they
 
01:38:29.390 --> 01:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
filed that with the Dr and then once we
 
01:38:32.830 --> 01:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
have all the estimates in we notify uh
 
01:38:35.709 --> 01:38:35.719 align:start position:0%
DHHS of the estimated payments we also
 
01:38:37.629 --> 01:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
notify house Ways and Means and Senate
 
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means so you'll be getting a
 
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
letter on that here in the next coming
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
week or
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
so um 100% of the Met owed is due to the
 
01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
Dr honor before April 15 so we received
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
those return we received those returns
 
01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
and those payments and then we deposit
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
those funds into the uncompensated care
 
01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid fund established by RSA 167
 
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
col 64 again that's into a restricted
 
01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.390 align:start position:0%
col 64 again that's into a restricted
revenue

01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
account lastly the commissioner of DHHS
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
is responsible for expending those funds
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
in accordance with RSA 167 colon 64 and
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is for what you'll hear as termed
 
01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
the Dish payment so it's a dish
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
proportionate share Hospital pay payment
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
and other medicated expenditures so just
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
at a very high level the Met money Flows
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
In from the hospitals the hospitals
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
report that they get or the excuse me
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
let me start over the money Flows In
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals we report that to DHHS we get
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
some matching funds from the federal
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
government and then the hospitals get
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
some of that money back in what's termed
 
01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:49.159 align:start position:0%
a Dish
 
01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:52.360 align:start position:0%
payment lastly Dr is authorized to audit
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
met returns and we can also collect
 
01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.830 align:start position:0%
met returns and we can also collect
unpaid

01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
unpaid
 
01:39:59.950 --> 01:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
met happy to answer any questions in any
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions on Medicaid
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
enhan this is representative Ames y yes
 
01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ames okay um yeah when I
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
first came into Ways and Means eight or
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
nine years nine years ago we were uh
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
actively uh reviewing the Met um and
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
estimating um revenues from it that
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
changed it became a restricted fund I
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
understand that but what I don't
 
01:40:33.910 --> 01:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
understand is why Ways and Means is
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
estimating going forward on what is in
 
01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
fact a very large Revenue
 
01:40:45.629 --> 01:40:45.639 align:start position:0%
stream and I'm not sure anyone else is
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
doing that other than the hospitals am I
 
01:40:50.510 --> 01:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
right about that
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
maybe um there are others who answer
 
01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.790 align:start position:0%
maybe um there are others who answer
this

01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
question better but I I'll just throw it
 
01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.070 align:start position:0%
question better but I I'll just throw it
out

01:40:59.070 --> 01:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
there I think cret might be able to
 
01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:03.709 align:start position:0%
there I think cret might be able to
answer

01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
that Chris yep um I can try so typically
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
the role excuse me the role of the
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee has been to deal with just the
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue estimates you have
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
many many many restricted revenues in
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
the state um that you don't address
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
directly the legislature through RSA has
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
given authority to an entity to collect
 
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
and distribute the revenue unlike the
 
01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
general fund unrestricted Revenue which
 
01:41:37.229 --> 01:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't get appropriated until you build
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
the budget so I I think there maybe some
 
01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
distinction with you've already provided
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
some authority to entities to spend
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
money that's been collected so you don't
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
need to do the estimates they're Bound
 
01:41:50.589 --> 01:41:50.599 align:start position:0%
by um rules and laws that say your
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
estimates need to meet your expenses if
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
your expenses exceed any Revenue then
 
01:41:57.709 --> 01:41:57.719 align:start position:0%
you need to reduce your um basically
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
your appropriation for that restricted
 
01:42:04.229 --> 01:42:04.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue in the terms of um the met that
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
was three or three or four budgets ago
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
that was change from a general fund
 
01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:13.639 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue to a restricted
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue within
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
HHS and as Melissa described it's used
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the the dish or just proportionate
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
share to hospitals where um basically
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
they make up for some of the
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care that they um have
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
provided and then if there's anything
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
left the department is able to use that
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
towards provider payments after they've
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
taken care of the the dish aspect um but
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the best answer I have for
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Ames is that um
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
typically the those restricted funds
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
have uh the ability and statute to be
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
expended collected and expended already
 
01:42:49.629 --> 01:42:49.639 align:start position:0%
whereas the unrestricted Dome that's
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
taken care of through your operating
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
budget and passing that piece of
 
01:42:52.639 --> 01:42:54.109 align:start position:0%
budget and passing that piece of
legislation

01:42:54.109 --> 01:42:54.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
and and Chris how
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
many what is the approximate number of
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
unrestricted funds there I mean
 
01:43:03.470 --> 01:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
restricted funds are there out there so
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
your your dedicated funds you have in
 
01:43:09.629 --> 01:43:09.639 align:start position:0%
excess of there's been over 350
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds created over the years
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
not all of those still exist some of
 
01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
those are repealed um over the years
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
they don't reuse the same
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
number but you have dedicated funds or
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
restricted funds in almost every agency
 
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
um for one reason or another um the has
 
01:43:29.709 --> 01:43:29.719 align:start position:0%
agreed that um a particular Revenue
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
stream should be dedicated for a certain
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
purpose and has provided that in the
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
statute restricted funds are not um
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
funds that agencies just decide to keep
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
and and do what they want with there's
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
there's Direction provided in statute
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
for them to use that money but yeah so
 
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
there's probably somewhere over 300 that
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
are active or are still in existence I
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
should say because not all dedicated
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
funds are necessarily active they're
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
just may be sitting there dormant um and
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
your committee Ways and Means Committee
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
does look at that um periodically you
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
look at the dedicated funds and and make
 
01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
determinations on what should happen
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
with those right there's a separate
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
committee it's a joint committee to look
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
at that every year to see which ones are
 
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
active or inactive which ones should be
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
done away with and our committee will be
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
handling legislation this year as a
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
result of
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
committee and Norm It's Pat Norm yes can
 
01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:32.199 align:start position:0%
I speak up um yeah I've consulted in
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
hospitals for 43 years so I know a
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
little something about this tax um it's
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
when we say net revenues it's not profit
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
first off people hear net revenue they
 
01:44:44.910 --> 01:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
think it's profit in hospitals uh gross
 
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
charges is what you see as the in their
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
in their revenue per type of procedure
 
01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
but it's really net the net is the net
 
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
of that uh after contractuals so Blue
 
01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
Cross sees the charges but let's say a
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
chest Stakes way is on there on their
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
books $100 but Blue Cross is only going
 
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
$50 so that is the contractual
 
01:45:10.270 --> 01:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
difference so the net in this is really
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
the net charges not not the net profit I
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that and it's
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
really what this whole program is
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
designed to do is to help the hospitals
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
with high Medicaid populations it's very
 
01:45:25.870 --> 01:45:25.880 align:start position:0%
hard to survive with very high Medicaid
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
prop uh uh population so basically and
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
and self-pay patients so those hospitals
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
out of this fund will get more more
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue as the Dish payment that was
 
01:45:40.910 --> 01:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
described than those hospitals in a in a
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
good uh setting like my Hospital Exit
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
hospitals in a very good setting there's
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
not much much uh free care and all that
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
so uh so that's what the program is
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
about that's all thank you
 
01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.470 align:start position:0%
about that's all thank you
very

01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:45:57.149 --> 01:45:57.159 align:start position:0%
good uh any further questions or
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
comments on the Medicaid en question
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
chairman yes who's that Jim Murphy
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy go ahead U just a
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
question maybe they can answer is my
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
question is have we seen a significant
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
drop in the uh uh met payments because
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
of covid I know that a lot of Hospital
 
01:46:20.189 --> 01:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
util utilizations are way down and the
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
other question I had is what percentage
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
of the Met payment coming in Gross is
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
actually going back in Dish payments to
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
the contributing hospitals and has that
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
declined over the years since its
 
01:46:36.669 --> 01:46:36.679 align:start position:0%
Inception in the early
 
01:46:39.149 --> 01:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
90s great great question representative
 
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
Murphy so for payments um so as I stated
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
before what's do this month are the
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
January 15th non-binding estimate
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
payments were B which is based on the
 
01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
hospital's fiscal year ending 2020 so
 
01:46:53.629 --> 01:46:53.639 align:start position:0%
those are flowing in as we speak so
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
we'll have official numbers probably
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
next week or by the end of this week to
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
let you know how much they've decreased
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
but we do anticipate a decrease based on
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh the covid situation and how the
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals have been struggling some as
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
for the percentage of met payments out
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
of dish I don't have that answer because
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh DHHS is the one who's responsible for
 
01:47:17.310 --> 01:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
the dish payments but we could probably
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
reach out to them and get you some
 
01:47:20.669 --> 01:47:20.679 align:start position:0%
information on historical dish payments
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
being made my my my reason for that
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
second question was that my
 
01:47:27.310 --> 01:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
understanding when this initially came
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
out was that the Met payment was made by
 
01:47:30.679 --> 01:47:31.550 align:start position:0%
out was that the Met payment was made by
the

01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals it the federal was a one to
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
one match on it and it was supposed to
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
go back basically you know keeping the
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals hold with regard to the Met
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
payment and my experience is that that
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
has actually decreased over time uh
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
meaning the money is going back to the
 
01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals I just wondering if that trend
 
01:47:49.239 --> 01:47:50.910 align:start position:0%
hospitals I just wondering if that trend
is

01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
continuing sure we'll get you some
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
information on that thank you major this
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
is Chris just to um let the committee
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
know the Department of Health and Human
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
Services is speaking to you this

just um maybe have some information
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
related to the met and the distribution
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
of that good because um they're going to
 
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
be speaking to us at 1:30 this
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon all right any further
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on Medicaid
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
enhancement taxs
 
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
if not next is Nursing Facility quality
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
assessment thank you so the nursing
 
01:48:33.390 --> 01:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
facility quality assessment or NF QA is
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
a 5 a half% tax upon the net patient
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
services revenue on all nursing
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
facilities on the basis of patient days
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
in each facility the assessment is paid
 
01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
by the nursing facilities as well as
 
01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
facilities licensed as a specialty
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
hospital and certified to receive
 
01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement as a nursing
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
facility and F QA is assessed quarterly
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
with returns due on the 10th of the
 
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
month following the quarter in payment
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
if via check is due on the 15th the
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
facilities are paying electronically
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
they do have until the end of the month
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
to pay those facilities can now file
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
well this is a 10-year trend of nqa
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
based on unaudited cash the current five
 
01:49:21.589 --> 01:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
and a half percent rate applied to all
 
01:49:23.510 --> 01:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
years in this chart
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
slide nursing facilities file their
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
quarterly returns with both the Dr and
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
HHS they typically pay their assessment
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
due by electronic funds transfer and
 
01:49:43.070 --> 01:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that the NF QA
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
revenue is deposited directly into the
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
nursing facility trust fund so again
 
01:49:48.990 --> 01:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
much like met this assessment does not
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
go into the general education trust
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
funds outlined there um the commissioner
 
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
of HHS is responsible for expending
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
funds in accordance with RSA
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
151 d e col 15 the monies in the fund
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
shall be used to eliminate or reduce to
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
the maximum extent possible the
 
01:50:07.149 --> 01:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
difference between the allowable
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid costs derived from the nursing
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
facility Medicaid Acuity rate setting
 
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
system which nursing facilities incur in
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
providing care to Medicaid residents and
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
the amount which the state has budgeted
 
01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
in order to fund that Care Dr is
 
01:50:25.390 --> 01:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
authorized much like Matt to audit nfq
 
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
returns and collect unpaid nqa
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
liability are there any questions on
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
nqa yeah I would have thought that on
 
01:50:36.350 --> 01:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
your 10year
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
Trend that there would have seen some
 
01:50:42.589 --> 01:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
effect of the pandemic on
 
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
fy20 revenues if not is it going to be
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
show up in
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
fy21 and which your
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
anticipation um currently the um NF QA
 
01:50:58.589 --> 01:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
um for FY
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
2021 again right now nfq um facilities
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
are paying their third uh their second
 
01:51:08.069 --> 01:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
quarter um payments which are due by the
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
end of this month but currently NF QA um
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
is 8.9% above prior fiscal year at this
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
point and um 16.5% below fiscal year
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
2021 plan but again on caution with
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
those numbers we haven't seen all
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue come in for January at this
 
01:51:27.669 --> 01:51:27.679 align:start position:0%
point um we'll no more as the fiscal
 
01:51:29.790 --> 01:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
year goes on I guess but as of right now
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to be too affected by by
 
01:51:37.950 --> 01:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
facilities that begs another question is
 
01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
how's the occupancy rate on these n
 
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities is that being
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
decreasing that's not something that we
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
have but we more more than happy to look
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
into that for you and get back to the
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
Comm on okay Norm can I make a comment
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
please represent BR yeah just just for
 
01:52:02.589 --> 01:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
the members uh every every every county
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
has a county home uh that we're that
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for overseeing and the
 
01:52:10.589 --> 01:52:10.599 align:start position:0%
budget and Etc so this is just be aware
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
that this this affects our County homes
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
comment any further questions or
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
comments this is represent elme
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative elme thank you on the
 
01:52:30.990 --> 01:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
there was a few Year back back when this
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
got started it's essentially another
 
01:52:36.189 --> 01:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid type thing where you're
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
transferring money from the nursing
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
homes that have more paying customers to
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes that aren't getting
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
sufficient money from the state to make
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
up uh which would include our County
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
homes and and uh there was a big fight
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
going on in the early days about the
 
01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
Continuing Care Facilities which have
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
nursing home sections within them but
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
have signed a um a pledge that they will
 
01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
not have any of their members go on to
 
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid uh so they have no chance of
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
recuperating anything from it and can
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
you tell us which on whe who which side
 
01:53:21.430 --> 01:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
won that
 
01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:25.709 align:start position:0%
won that
fight

01:53:25.709 --> 01:53:25.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
that is the continuing cares did not
 
01:53:31.229 --> 01:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
want to have to pay
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
this represent Vol me this is Chris I I
 
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
think that's a question that's probably
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
directed at Department of Health and
 
01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:39.229 align:start position:0%
directed at Department of Health and
Human

01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
Services so again I I'll reach out to
 
01:53:42.589 --> 01:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
Karen and let her know that that
 
01:53:44.510 --> 01:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
question may be
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
coming we were our committee was
 
01:53:51.790 --> 01:53:51.800 align:start position:0%
involved in in redoing the Met tax when
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
it was falling apart completely and nine
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
years ago and then a year or two later
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
when this was
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
created Norm can I just jump in real
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
quick again um go ahead Pat we have five
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
more minutes yeah I know more topics go
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
ahead it's just I I was involved in this
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
10 years nine nine years ago uh where
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
the ccc's Continuing Care uh residential
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
communities which are um independent
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
assisted and then nursing home but they
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
they they life contracts no Medicaid and
 
01:54:27.990 --> 01:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted out of the Met tax uh that
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
was maybe that was the fight you were
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
talking about Susan yes but there was no
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
what happened that that bill got
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
defeated but short of it that's the
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
answer okay U do we have any other
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
questions on this because there's a few
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
more items to cover in the next five
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
minutes youtility property tax all right
 
01:54:51.390 --> 01:54:51.400 align:start position:0%
utility property tax it's a tax rate of
 
01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:52.990 align:start position:0%
utility property tax it's a tax rate of
6.6

01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
6.6
 
01:54:56.069 --> 01:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
cents per thousand of value the taxes
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
value of utility property as determined
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
by the department on December 1st of
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
each year for the values as of April
 
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.280 align:start position:0%
1 so when to file and pay on a for May
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
1st of each year the company files a
 
01:55:09.870 --> 01:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
form detailing the company's actual
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
Financial operating performance since
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
the prior of April 1st of the preceding
 
01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
year so final payments for this is are
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
due January 15th so essentially there
 
01:55:23.390 --> 01:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
estimate payments made made on prior
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
evaluations so April June September and
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
December are on the FI the prior
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
evaluation and then January 15th we sort
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
of call a true up return where they pay
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
the difference from the prior year
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
valuation to the current
 
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
rate on the next slide we have the upt
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
revenue 10year Trend uh and some of the
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
things that can affect the factors for
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
upt are obviously development of newer
 
01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facilities valuation
 
01:55:54.589 --> 01:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
utility property or energy pricing
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
supply and
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
demand any any questions on
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
upt questions or comments on utility
 
01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:06.669 align:start position:0%
upt questions or comments on utility
property

01:56:06.669 --> 01:56:06.679 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
tax uh then we can go on to the railroad
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
tax so the railroad tax is a smaller tax
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
compared to the ones we've previously
 
01:56:18.149 --> 01:56:18.159 align:start position:0%
discussed um every railroad Railway
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
Express parlor sleeping or Dining Car
 
01:56:21.629 --> 01:56:21.639 align:start position:0%
Company operating for profit New
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire pays a railroad tax it's based
 
01:56:25.390 --> 01:56:25.400 align:start position:0%
on the market value of property's full
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
and True Value as of April 1st each year
 
01:56:29.950 --> 01:56:29.960 align:start position:0%

01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
before May 1st each year the company
 
01:56:36.069 --> 01:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
files a form detailing the company's
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
Financial operating performance since
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
April 1st of the preceding year payment
 
01:56:43.310 --> 01:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
is due within 30 days from the date of
 
01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:45.280 align:start position:0%

to 25% of the tax are do on the 15th day
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
of April June September and December to
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
put this in perspective um for fiscal
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
year 2020
 
01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.480 align:start position:0%

01:57:10.189 --> 01:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
Statewide any
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on this on the
 
01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:17.430 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on this on the
railroad

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
railroad
 
01:57:21.149 --> 01:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
tax sand none go to the local property
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
tax right local property tax it's split
 
01:57:25.709 --> 01:57:25.719 align:start position:0%
into two sections we have the Statewide
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
education property tax which is swep and
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
the local property tax for swep the tax
 
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
is assessed and collected by
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities to be retained for use of
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
their local school district the tax is
 
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
paid by everyone owning real property in
 
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
the state the department sets as Lindsay
 
01:57:44.669 --> 01:57:44.679 align:start position:0%
had stated before all the tax rates for
 
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
the state and municipalities so the
 
01:57:48.430 --> 01:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
department sets the tax rate of a level
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
suff sufficient to what's in the statute
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
which is 363 million and then the rate
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
is set to the nearest half cent
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
necessary to generate that required
 
01:57:59.790 --> 01:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
revenue and then for the local property
 
01:58:02.589 --> 01:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
tax side uh the property tax is B on
 
01:58:04.750 --> 01:58:04.760 align:start position:0%
based on local assessed valuations and
 
01:58:06.069 --> 01:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
administered and collected by the
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
individual towns and cities uh the
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
majority of the property taxes collected
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
are based on the market value and then
 
01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:13.719 align:start position:0%
there's some exemptions in the property
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
taxes which are listed below happy to
 
01:58:19.189 --> 01:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:23.709 --> 01:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
questions I don't i' like to just on ask
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
her for something for later on and I
 
01:58:30.270 --> 01:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
asked this last week actually on you
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
have a major major role in
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing the fairness of this tax
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
across the towns and it would be nice to
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
have a sheet that showed your
 
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
Administration on that
 
01:58:47.629 --> 01:58:47.639 align:start position:0%
level sure we can get you something that
 
01:58:47.639 --> 01:58:48.709 align:start position:0%
level sure we can get you something that
shows

01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
shows
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
that okay we can deal with that later as
 
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
we meet with the Dr because we're
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
running out of time uh quick on
 
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:02.760 align:start position:0%

01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%

01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
officials um the Dr is responsible for
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
administering and enforcing the tax tax
 
01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
which includes activities like educating

Municipal officials checking volumes of
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%

entering any lands that may have been
 
01:59:29.390 --> 01:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
excavated at any point and notice of
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
intent to excavate along with a $100
 
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
admin fee must be filed with the Dr
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
prior to excavation and at the beginning
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
of each tax year which is April 1st for
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
those operations still in progress
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
owners must report all Earth excavated
 
01:59:45.189 --> 01:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
within 30 days of completion within 30
 
01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
days of that date local assessing
 
01:59:49.709 --> 01:59:49.719 align:start position:0%
officials must send a tax bill and then
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
that tax must be paid within 30 days of
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
it being mailed any questions for the
 
01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:57.470 align:start position:0%
it being mailed any questions for the
gravel

01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
gravel
 
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
tax I don't hear anybody we'll go to the
 
02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:01.709 align:start position:0%
tax I don't hear anybody we'll go to the
timber

02:00:01.709 --> 02:00:01.719 align:start position:0%
timber
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
tax so the timber tax is assessed at a
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
rate of 10% of the stumpage value at the
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
time of cutting it is assessed by in
 
02:00:10.589 --> 02:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
payable to the local assessing officials
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
much like the gravel tax the only
 
02:00:14.550 --> 02:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
exceptions are shade and ornamental
 
02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
trees sugar Orchards Nursery stock and
 
02:00:19.229 --> 02:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
Christmas trees and um certain amounts
 
02:00:21.589 --> 02:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
of firewood the Dr is responsible for
 
02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
admin enforc an attacks which also
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
includes entering land which there may
 
02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
be a Timber operation reviewing those
 
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
Timber operation records and stopping
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
any operations in violation reporting
 
02:00:33.229 --> 02:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
those to local authorities the owner
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
must file a notice of intent to cut with
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal assessing officials with a
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
copy to the owner logger in the Dr at
 
02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
the beginning of each tax year April 1st
 
02:00:44.270 --> 02:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
or for ongoing operations or prior to
 
02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
commencing each cutting operation the
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
owners much like the excavation tax must
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
report all wood or Timber cut within 30
 
02:00:53.069 --> 02:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
days of completion local assessing
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
officials assess the tax within 30 days
 
02:00:58.270 --> 02:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
and then upon mailing that bill the tax
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
must be paid within 30 days again any
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
questions with the timber tax okay we'll
 
02:01:06.669 --> 02:01:06.679 align:start position:0%
go to the next
 
02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
item okay so I think we've covered all
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
our taxes this is just a quick slide to
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
have for your reference it's just the
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
timing of how dr's money flows in the
 
02:01:17.910 --> 02:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
top is by month the middle is by quarter
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
and the the lower section is by annually
 
02:01:23.189 --> 02:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
and I think the only thing to point out
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
which Lindsay had point out in the
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
previous presentation one of the big
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
ones is indd if you look at indd in the
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
bottom half the first half of the fiscal
 
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
year only brings in 24% of the money and
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
the second half brings in 76% of the
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
money so we have um a big chunk of money
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
coming in for the second half of the
 
02:01:40.159 --> 02:01:43.229 align:start position:0%
coming in for the second half of the
fiscal

02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.709 --> 02:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
year oh and on the next slide this is
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
just a list of resources um for for your
 
02:01:52.709 --> 02:01:52.719 align:start position:0%
team and for the new people to at we
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
have our annual report we have our
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
transparency page which has some
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
reporting we have a daily revenue
 
02:02:01.709 --> 02:02:01.719 align:start position:0%
updates which comes through email which
 
02:02:03.550 --> 02:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully everybody on the committee is
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
receiving at this point we have our tax
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
expenditure which is on our web page and
 
02:02:11.149 --> 02:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
then there's also a Dr list serve which
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
I highly recommend everybody subscribing
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
to and it essentially gives you alerts
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
when press releases come out or TI tis
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
are coming out sends you a notification
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh for those for those items and do you
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
laws hi this is Caroline I'm gonna take
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
over for a minute um so before we talk
 
02:02:40.950 --> 02:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
about revenues it certainly makes sense
 
02:02:44.669 --> 02:02:44.679 align:start position:0%
to discuss the $30 million anom
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable um as part of the
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
state's year on financial reporting um
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
the state uh converts revenue from a
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
cash basis to an acrel basis and in
 
02:03:00.109 --> 02:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
order to determine acral basis revenues
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
um the state looks at the first 60 days
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year where the underlying
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
activity had actually occurred in the
 
02:03:10.470 --> 02:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
prior prior fiscal year um and removes
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
that from the current year and adds it
 
02:03:14.430 --> 02:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
back to the prior year um these amounts
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
are referred to as the 60-day receivable
 
02:03:20.030 --> 02:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and the process for determining the
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
60-day receivable happens in two phases
 
02:03:27.030 --> 02:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
preliminary and final um these amounts
 
02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
are typically fairly consistent from
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
gear to
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
year and um as a result we don't really
 
02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
talk about them um but in this year
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
there was a difference um first the
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
amounts for fiscal year 2020 for
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
business taxes and the indd tax were
 
02:03:49.069 --> 02:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
more than usual due to the federal due
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
date change um the federal due date for
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
personal and business income taxes was
 
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
extended from April 15th to July 15th
 
02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
due to the pandemic um here in New
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we only extended the due date
 
02:04:05.470 --> 02:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
to June 15th um because we were mindful
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
of ensuring revenues were received
 
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
during the state's fiscal year as
 
02:04:12.589 --> 02:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
intended however many of our taxpayers
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
still filed their New Hampshire State
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
returns consistent with the federal July
 
02:04:21.069 --> 02:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
15th due date um and as a result we had
 
02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of Revenue received in um the in
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year rather than in
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
last um second the amounts for the final
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
day the final 60-day receivable were
 
02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
more than the preliminary 60-day
 
02:04:38.669 --> 02:04:38.679 align:start position:0%
receivable um as a result of incomplete
 
02:04:40.950 --> 02:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue data for the month of July at
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
the time those preliminary amounts were
 
02:04:46.549 --> 02:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
calculated um these two factors resulted
 
02:04:50.589 --> 02:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
in the somewhat large $3.8 million in
 
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue receip receiv
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
received in July and August um which
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
should have been attributable to fiscal
 
02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:56.629 align:start position:0%
should have been attributable to fiscal
year

02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
2020 these amounts are um listed on the
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
monthly Revenue focus and included in
 
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
revenues received FIS fiscal year to
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
date reported by us um and are generally
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
being accounted for when you take a look
 
02:05:13.709 --> 02:05:13.719 align:start position:0%
at our Revenue estimate ranges as well
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
they're specifically called out and
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
there at the bottom you'll see uh the
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
30.8 million divided amongst the various
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:29.069 --> 02:05:29.079 align:start position:0%
administer do you want to briefly um go
 
02:05:41.470 --> 02:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
summary uh I guess I will take this so
 
02:05:47.910 --> 02:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
um what you see uh in front of you is
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
our fiscal year 21 Revenue estimate sign
 
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
summary you'll see fiscal year 20 on the
 
02:05:56.669 --> 02:05:56.679 align:start position:0%
right preliminary acral plus the
 
02:05:59.629 --> 02:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
anomalous acrel moving to the right
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
you'll see plan for the year you see our
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
Dr low and high for each of the taxes of
 
02:06:07.470 --> 02:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
where we estimate that fiscal year 21
 
02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:08.310 align:start position:0%
where we estimate that fiscal year 21
will

02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:06:10.470 --> 02:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
land and then we show you both the
 
02:06:13.030 --> 02:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and the percent percentage
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
change from the Dr low to plan and then
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
Dr High to plan so again this is just
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
where we think fiscal year 21 is going
 
02:06:22.109 --> 02:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
to land because obviously this will
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
serve as your base as you build your
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates for fiscal years 22
 
02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
and 23 I will call out at the bottom for
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
representative abrami based on his
 
02:06:33.149 --> 02:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
comment last week we're showing you the
 
02:06:34.549 --> 02:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
amounts of school building aid for
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 what we anticipate the
 
02:06:40.430 --> 02:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
lchip amount to be typically roughly 3%
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
and then the amount to the affordable
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
housing fund um since the numbers up
 
02:06:47.069 --> 02:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
above are net of those so you could add
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
those back in before applying your
 
02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:50.510 align:start position:0%
those back in before applying your
growth

02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
growth
 
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:52.350 align:start position:0%
growth
rates

02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay and brief summary of the fy22 and
 
02:07:00.750 --> 02:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
23 sure for fiscal years 22 and 23
 
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the First Column we
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
included the fiscal year 21 anomalous
 
02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
receivable um you will want to take that
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
out of fiscal year 21 before you apply
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
growth rates for fiscal year 22 and 23
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
if you were to include it you would
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
essentially be double counting that
 
02:07:22.109 --> 02:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
Revenue um so we show you what the 21
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable was and then we
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
remove it from our low and high
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
estimates for fiscal year 21 in that
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
second and third orange column and then
 
02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.159 align:start position:0%
we give you growth ranges for fiscal
 
02:07:34.950 --> 02:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
years 22 a low and a high by tax type
 
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
and then fiscal years 23 a low and a
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
high by tax
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
type again at the bottom we'll give you
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
the school building Aid amounts um which
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
go into M&amp;R the lchip amount which is
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
part of R and the affordable housing
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
fund transfer which is also part of R
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
again so that you can add those back in
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
prior to applying your growth rates if
 
02:07:57.189 --> 02:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's how you would like to estimate
 
02:07:57.199 --> 02:08:00.030 align:start position:0%
that's how you would like to estimate
your

02:08:00.030 --> 02:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
revenues we'll obviously be prepared to
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
come back whenever the committee is
 
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
ready to dive into this in more detail
 
02:08:07.709 --> 02:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to or we were asked and we
 
02:08:09.069 --> 02:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide you with our
 
02:08:11.709 --> 02:08:11.719 align:start position:0%
preliminary thoughts for fiscal years 21
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
22 and
 
02:08:17.629 --> 02:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
23 and a few brief words on your rims
 
02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
system sure so rims are Revenue
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
information management system is a
 
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
30.1 30.2 almost million doll um Capital
 
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
project that the Dr is currently
 
02:08:32.549 --> 02:08:32.559 align:start position:0%
undertaking the goal here is to replace
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
our current Tims system um which was
 
02:08:37.830 --> 02:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
implemented in 1990 that system is
 
02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
Obsolete and limited in its
 
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
functionality uh rims will be used
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
internally here at the department but it
 
02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
also has a public facing portal which
 
02:08:47.109 --> 02:08:47.119 align:start position:0%
I'll show you in just a second for
 
02:08:48.549 --> 02:08:48.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners um we are doing this in
 
02:08:52.629 --> 02:08:52.639 align:start position:0%
conjunction with DOI y we have a great
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
partnership with the Department of
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%

Enterprises um for them to implement
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%

implementation is going to be in three
 
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
phases each taking about a year and the
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
total contract with fast is just under
 
02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:14.910 align:start position:0%
total contract with fast is just under
$30

02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
$30
 
02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:17.559 align:start position:0%
million this is an outline of the three
 
02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:20.199 align:start position:0%

as follows um and after each Revenue
 
02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:29.559 align:start position:0%
source is an estimate of the revenue we
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
expect to derive this year from that
 
02:13:34.510 --> 02:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
source and in cases where we've raised
 
02:13:37.149 --> 02:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
guidance there'll be brackets and the
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
amount we expect to increase over what
 
02:13:41.950 --> 02:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
we had originally estimated based on
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
various factors we can get into so the
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
First Source is our jackpot games which
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
are Powerball Mega Millions and
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
megabytes uh as many of you know these
 
02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
are highly visible games very profitable
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
um we had just had a giant jackpot run
 
02:13:59.709 --> 02:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
for Powerball Mega Millions which to
 
02:14:00.830 --> 02:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
give you an
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
example in one week we would do six
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
million in sales in Powerball milon
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
Millions where an average week would be
 
02:14:10.750 --> 02:14:10.760 align:start position:0%
700,000 so it's a you know a nine
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes 10x Factor growth so for the
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
for the FIS year 21 we expect
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
to conservatively do 21.5 million
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
profit in those three product
 
02:14:28.109 --> 02:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
lines following next is Tri State Games
 
02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:30.119 align:start position:0%
megabuck is a trate game but we also
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
sell up a number of other ones uh pick
 
02:14:34.109 --> 02:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
three pick four which are daily number
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
of games uh Gimme Five which is a pick
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
five number game and fast play which is
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
a terminal product we share all those
 
02:14:44.430 --> 02:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
with Vermont and Maine they're all very
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
stable very dependable very normalized
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh we expect $9.7 million in profit with
 
02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:52.109 align:start position:0%
uh we expect $9.7 million in profit with
those

02:14:52.109 --> 02:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
Kino is a game uh you folks approved in
 
02:14:58.549 --> 02:14:58.559 align:start position:0%
2018 uh we launched in 2018 which was
 
02:15:00.669 --> 02:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
the fastest launch of Kino in the US
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
History uh and that had been enjoying
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
tremendous growth preco uh when bars
 
02:15:09.549 --> 02:15:09.559 align:start position:0%
closed down as you can imagine uh sales
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
plummeted sales have rebounded nicely um
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
and are accelerating so we estimate
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
another quarter million dollars profit
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
over and above our Revenue estimates of
 
02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
November uh so 7 75 million for Kino
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year uh Lucky for Life is a
 
02:15:27.589 --> 02:15:27.599 align:start position:0%
multi-state game we share with a number
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
of states um the top prize never changes
 
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
so the sales are very stable $1.6
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
million profit there insta tickets is
 
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
the bulk of what we sell um they are
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
sold at retail they're throughout our
 
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
1200 retail network uh have been
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
available for many many years they
 
02:15:51.229 --> 02:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
stable in almost every lottery in the US
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
um and they sales have been increasing
 
02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
so we're raising guidance a million
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to $53 million for scratch
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
ticket sales and
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
profitability next would be mobile and
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
internet which you folks approved in
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
2018 it has been the fastest growing
 
02:16:09.310 --> 02:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
area of the lottery
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
um you can buy Powerball Mega Millions
 
02:16:13.510 --> 02:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
and you can buy scratch tickets through
 
02:16:15.069 --> 02:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
your mobile
 
02:16:17.629 --> 02:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
applications and we had estimated $10
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
million profit in November we now
 
02:16:22.310 --> 02:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
estimate $1 13 million profit profit uh
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
for this fiscal year sports betting
 
02:16:28.270 --> 02:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
which is our newest product line uh
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
launched in
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
2019 uh December 30th
 
02:16:37.709 --> 02:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
um this fiscal year sales have that have
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
been have been higher than we
 
02:16:42.270 --> 02:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
anticipated um but we're still nervous
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine we're unclear as to
 
02:16:46.270 --> 02:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
the sports
 
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
betting map or the sports betting
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
calendar as it were uh obviously with
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
covid but given the acceleration and the
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
growth we've enjoyed um by way of
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
example we had a record
 
02:17:01.309 --> 02:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
December um in terms of sports betting
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
activity we estimate $1 million profit
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
for sports betting for this fiscal year
 
02:17:09.230 --> 02:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
and finally uh is charitable gambling
 
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
which involves all of the charitable
 
02:17:14.349 --> 02:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
functions of the State uh bingo lucky s
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
and includes also some small version of
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
horse racing simoc cast um that function
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
is really regulatory we don't really get
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
involved in promotion um that is
 
02:17:28.190 --> 02:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
generates about $3 million so that all
 
02:17:30.030 --> 02:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
being said Mr chairman members of the
 
02:17:32.150 --> 02:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh the lottery is Raising
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
guidance uh $10 million to this fiscal
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
year of10 million. five5 million for
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
revenue for this fiscal year um well and
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
above what we had originally estimated
 
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll stop there answer any questions
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
you want to have if that works for you
 
02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh yes it does um
 
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
let me pull up and representative major
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
panelists should be able to raise their
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
hands now if people want to go ahead and
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
try that great okay questions raise your
 
02:18:07.750 --> 02:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
first representative browny you have to
 
02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:13.469 align:start position:0%
first representative browny you have to
unmute

02:18:13.469 --> 02:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:17.469 --> 02:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
yourself uh Charlie It's Pat um uh for
 
02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
the Powerball and mega miliams can you
 
02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
tell the committee how much we make per
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
ticket sold how that works certainly um
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
Powerball bam millions are our most
 
02:18:29.469 --> 02:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
profitable games out of every dollar
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
sold 40.5 cents approximately is profit
 
02:18:36.910 --> 02:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
and that goes directly to the state so
 
02:18:38.589 --> 02:18:38.599 align:start position:0%
it's I want to say our most erratic
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
product because some years like I said
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
some weeks the jackpots a billion
 
02:18:44.669 --> 02:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
dollars and some weeks the jackpots 20
 
02:18:47.309 --> 02:18:47.319 align:start position:0%
and the growth in sales is exponential
 
02:18:50.429 --> 02:18:50.439 align:start position:0%
in those High jackpot weeks so our sales
 
02:18:53.429 --> 02:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
depend on having a number of large
 
02:18:55.389 --> 02:18:55.399 align:start position:0%
jackpots in a given year and our
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
revenues reflect the number of jackpots
 
02:18:59.270 --> 02:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
we have in a given year because like I
 
02:19:01.950 --> 02:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
said it is our most profitable product
 
02:19:05.429 --> 02:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
um 40.5 cents give or take uh every
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
dollar we
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
sell thank you
 
02:19:13.190 --> 02:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
representer Amanda
 
02:19:16.589 --> 02:19:16.599 align:start position:0%
Gro um thank you I just had one question
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
while you're going to the revenue
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
sources um for example you would say
 
02:19:24.709 --> 02:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
like the jackpot games 21.5 million was
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
profit or is that just Revenue it's
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
profit every number on your screen
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
representative the question that's our
 
02:19:33.669 --> 02:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
what we expect a profit and obviously
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
these are estimates because our expenses
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
vary by profit by product um but you
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
know obviously we don't account for
 
02:19:42.629 --> 02:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
every staff member's time as against
 
02:19:43.990 --> 02:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
each product you know like with like a
 
02:19:48.190 --> 02:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
billing sheet but these are all profit
 
02:19:54.429 --> 02:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
me represent you're going to have to
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
unmute yourself sorry uh quick just
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
quickly on for instance jackpot games
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%

02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
21.5 is what you have raised your
 
02:20:11.309 --> 02:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
projection two and 2.4 is the amount you
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
raised it correct yes representative yes
 
02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:17.270 align:start position:0%
raised it correct yes representative yes
thank

02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
you uh further
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
Elliot you'll have to unmute yourself
 
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
hat okay um Charles I uh wondered how do
 
02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
you account for this the success is it
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
because of the the the corona effect
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
people are being staying home more often
 
02:20:47.190 --> 02:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
and they're bored and they need a little
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
excitement in their life how do you
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
account for your success
 
02:20:54.910 --> 02:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
I mean certainly um I like to think we
 
02:20:56.429 --> 02:20:56.439 align:start position:0%
did had something to do with it
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative um you know we're
 
02:21:00.429 --> 02:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
certainly if you look to our neighbors
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
our growth rate is far and away faster
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
than any else around us so I certainly
 
02:21:09.070 --> 02:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
you kinded lot the folks here I do think
 
02:21:11.309 --> 02:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
there have been a number of additional
 
02:21:13.870 --> 02:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state who would not be
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
here ordinarily that have accounted for
 
02:21:17.830 --> 02:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
sales like for example Instant tickets
 
02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
sales have increased but not acoss the
 
02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
state uniformly it's been really pockets
 
02:21:26.349 --> 02:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
of growth and so like ala Lakes Region
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
you've seen a significant growth of
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
sales I think a lot of folks have moved
 
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
up here during covid it wouldn't be
 
02:21:34.750 --> 02:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
ordinarily and that's accounting for
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
some of our sales growth as well and I
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
also think there's a lot of
 
02:21:40.429 --> 02:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
entertainment options that don't exist
 
02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
anymore and folks are looking for
 
02:21:44.349 --> 02:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
something to do it's you know this
 
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
entertaining so to your point yes part
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
covid part we're pretty good at what we
 
02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:54.270 align:start position:0%
covid part we're pretty good at what we
do

02:21:54.270 --> 02:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you charliie relative to the
 
02:22:01.349 --> 02:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
sports betting with the pandemic going
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
on now it doesn't seem like that
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
effective no no we had a real bad dip in
 
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
March through June when there was
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
virtually nothing to bet on all sports
 
02:22:12.399 --> 02:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
virtually nothing to bet on all sports
had

02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
cancelled um but there's been an
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
exuberance essentially of um just happy
 
02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
sports are back and I think that's a
 
02:22:24.750 --> 02:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
counter for a lot of it we also derive a
 
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of activity from
 
02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts at our facilities in
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Seabrook um I would
 
02:22:34.990 --> 02:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
estimate 75 80% of our Revenue in
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
Seabrook is from Massachusetts in terms
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
of sports betting activity so I think I
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
can't personally underestimated how much
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
interest there was
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
um in that we also even on the mobile
 
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
side representative major
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
20 plus percent of our revenues come
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts folks driving across
 
02:22:58.389 --> 02:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
the border to place a bet at you know
 
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
the mall of Nashua or this traffic
 
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
circle in Portsmouth they stop in the
 
02:23:04.990 --> 02:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
liquor store in the parking lot place a
 
02:23:07.590 --> 02:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
bet then drive back to mass or Maine so
 
02:23:09.309 --> 02:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
we've seeing a lot of that as well more
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
so than I
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
anticipated okay I don't see any other
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
hand so why don't you continue okay
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
certainly so this is just a general over
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
viw um of the lottery sales by game over
 
02:23:26.990 --> 02:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years and as you can see the
 
02:23:29.309 --> 02:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
bulk of it has been scratch tickets it's
 
02:23:31.469 --> 02:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
faren away the most in terms of gross
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
dollars these are this is a graph by
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
gross sales uh most of what we sell is
 
02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets um and really it's so
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
really now our sales would be in order
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
of size would be scratch tickets and
 
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
then Kino followed by Powerball and then
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
Mega Millions
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
um sports betting is obviously a big
 
02:23:56.309 --> 02:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
number in terms of how much betting
 
02:23:58.510 --> 02:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
activity we do but it's a very low
 
02:24:01.110 --> 02:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
margin activity sports betting for the
 
02:24:02.429 --> 02:24:02.439 align:start position:0%
state really
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
is well profits around 7% and we split
 
02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
5050 and here is sort of the lottery to
 
02:24:14.910 --> 02:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
Nutshell I wanted you to have this
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
number because it is it's uh page four
 
02:24:21.389 --> 02:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
on this uh presentation but it's in our
 
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive annual financial report
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
which rolls up into the state uh
 
02:24:27.790 --> 02:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
financial report and here are all the
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
numbers in the nutshell um as you can
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
see we've enjoyed tremendous growth over
 
02:24:35.309 --> 02:24:35.319 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years and obviously this
 
02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
year now that we're estimating $120
 
02:24:40.590 --> 02:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
million um we have a very like very
 
02:24:43.269 --> 02:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
possible chance to essentially double
 
02:24:45.269 --> 02:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
our net revenues over the last 10 years
 
02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
which we're obviously very proud of um
 
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
and in some cases you can see like
 
02:24:53.309 --> 02:24:53.319 align:start position:0%
scratch tiets as you go across that line
 
02:24:53.319 --> 02:24:55.190 align:start position:0%
scratch tiets as you go across that line
tremendous

02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
tremendous
 
02:24:58.110 --> 02:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
growth you know from $161 million in
 
02:25:02.269 --> 02:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
2011 to last year was $272 million and
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
this year I can tell you will exceed 300
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
million um but contrast that with say
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
for example the Powerball Mega Millions
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
line where in 2019 those combined for 60
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know 69 million and last year they
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
combine for 41 million so like I said
 
02:25:27.030 --> 02:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
they're quite ER RCT and that's based on
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
jackpot sizes and so when we Revenue
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
estimate scratch tickets you know we can
 
02:25:35.230 --> 02:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
tell you within $100 give or Tech what
 
02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
the profit will be for a year Powerball
 
02:25:40.110 --> 02:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
Mega Millions it varies wildly by year
 
02:25:40.120 --> 02:25:45.030 align:start position:0%
Mega Millions it varies wildly by year
so

02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave this and
 
02:25:50.910 --> 02:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
so obviously our Trends would be
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh we expect growth continued on digital
 
02:25:55.870 --> 02:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
platforms both internet lottery and
 
02:25:58.830 --> 02:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
sports betting um the biggest impact to
 
02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
our sales generally speaking
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
particularly at retail is fuel prices um
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
we do 52% of our sales at retail at
 
02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
places that sell gas too so um gas
 
02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
prices have a direct impact on our sales
 
02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
more so than essentially any other
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
function and then if Massachusetts
 
02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
passes sports betting we would expect a
 
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
dramatic impact on our revenues so those
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
are our Trends Mr chairman members of
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
the committee I'll put that slide back
 
02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
up because it obviously contains the
 
02:26:31.870 --> 02:26:31.880 align:start position:0%
most data and your membership may have
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
the most questions regarding anything on
 
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:36.920 align:start position:0%
that sheet if that's okay with you
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's fine questions from the
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
02:26:46.469 --> 02:26:46.479 align:start position:0%
tuer yes um could you talk about problem
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
gambling a little bit I hadn't realized
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
how enormous the lottery sales were is
 
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
that something that people
 
02:26:59.150 --> 02:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
become habituated to addicted to in the
 
02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
same way as we worry about other forms
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
of gaming certainly no there's no
 
02:27:06.910 --> 02:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
question if you look at any of the
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
research that we follow and we do um one
 
02:27:12.269 --> 02:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
to one and a half percent of the people
 
02:27:15.790 --> 02:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
who play who gamble are technically
 
02:27:18.150 --> 02:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
problem gamblers and in a state like New
 
02:27:19.950 --> 02:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know that's thousands of
 
02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
people people so there is an issue
 
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
obviously with problem gambling um there
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
is a council that was set up by you
 
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
folks a couple years back which is Staff
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
U which is appointed folks uh by the
 
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
governor approved by the executive
 
02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
Council set up
 
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
to address it they're in the process now
 
02:27:41.190 --> 02:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
of an
 
02:27:44.510 --> 02:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
RFP um to contract for
 
02:27:48.110 --> 02:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
services um but we are candidly behind
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
some other states in terms of our
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
addressing the issue could I ask a
 
02:27:56.030 --> 02:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
followup please followup the reason I'm
 
02:27:59.230 --> 02:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
asking is there's some other uh gaming
 
02:28:02.070 --> 02:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities or uh bills that are
 
02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
coming forward and so it would be
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea to have a good
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
handle on how they RS how the uh
 
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals are coming along
 
02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
and what kind of timeline uh we're
 
02:28:18.670 --> 02:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
talking about to deal with problem
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
gamblers because I think that will be
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
one of the first questions people will
 
02:28:24.469 --> 02:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
want to know the answers

slides this next slide is our Revenue
 
02:34:26.590 --> 02:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
broken down into our three main

categories we have beer tax and permits
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
which is a 30 cents tax on a gallon per

markets the the last category is other
 
02:35:00.429 --> 02:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue which is primarily our license e
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
fees but it also includes direct
 
02:35:05.230 --> 02:35:05.240 align:start position:0%

02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue this next slide is the FY 16 to2
 
02:35:20.790 --> 02:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
annual um actual with FY um 21 to 23
 
02:35:24.030 --> 02:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
projections the annual growth from 16 to
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
20 was less than 1% or around 1.2
 
02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:28.630 align:start position:0%
20 was less than 1% or around 1.2
million

02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:35:32.469 --> 02:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
annually fy20 had a high Revenue growth
 
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
from pandemic purchases it was a 2.2%
 
02:35:38.349 --> 02:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
growth or $5 million
 
02:35:41.510 --> 02:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
increase you'll see an even more
 
02:35:44.830 --> 02:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
significant increase projected for fy21
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
which is about 4.6% or 10.3 million and
 
02:35:50.790 --> 02:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
this is primarily a result of not
 
02:35:53.309 --> 02:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
running uh the promotional carb programs
 
02:35:55.309 --> 02:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
that we've done in Prior years which was
 
02:35:58.830 --> 02:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
the spend 150 and received a $25 gift
 
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
card last year we ran it in July
 
02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
November and March um the last one was
 
02:36:07.469 --> 02:36:07.479 align:start position:0%
done in March of 20120 and this actually
 
02:36:10.030 --> 02:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
equated to a $10 million increase in our
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
gross profit in uh projected in
 
02:36:17.950 --> 02:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
fy21 fy22 and 23 projections the growth
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
rate is slightly higher than the prior
 
02:36:25.710 --> 02:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
year normal growth rate at 1.3 and 1.5%
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
which equates to about three and $3.5
 
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
increase on slide
 
02:36:39.870 --> 02:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
six this is the um this provides revenue
 
02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
and expense history that makes up our
 
02:36:44.429 --> 02:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
net profit which you can see at the top
 
02:36:45.510 --> 02:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
of each
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
bar um fy21 to FY 23 projections are all
 
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
around $160
 
02:36:54.630 --> 02:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
million this is because um from an
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
expense side we're we also have growth
 
02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
um primarily in fy21 the increas is for
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%

it and debt which is increasing about a
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars fy22 and 23 projections
 
02:37:14.590 --> 02:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh we not only have our normal operating
 
02:37:17.230 --> 02:37:17.240 align:start position:0%

02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
million on slide seven this just shows
 
02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
the total net profit broken down by
 
02:37:40.190 --> 02:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
liquor and wine and beer which are the
 
02:37:45.070 --> 02:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:47.630 --> 02:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
have okay and on
 
02:37:50.830 --> 02:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
slide eight and in conjunction with it
 
02:37:52.550 --> 02:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
slide nine if you could you can look at
 
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
both of them together um this slide is
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
important because it shows the history
 
02:37:58.429 --> 02:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
of the transfer to Health and Human
 
02:38:01.469 --> 02:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
Services for the for first the alcohol
 
02:38:04.030 --> 02:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
Abuse Prevention and treatment fund and
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
then the granted Advantage Healthcare
 
02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund that transferred to um
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
HHS so you can see in
 
02:38:17.469 --> 02:38:17.479 align:start position:0%
fy16 we had to transfer 3.2 million and
 
02:38:21.790 --> 02:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
that was at a 1.7% of our prior year
 
02:38:24.030 --> 02:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
gross profit and each year that
 
02:38:26.910 --> 02:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
percentage has changed to the point in
 
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
FY 20 it was uh 5% which equated to $10
 
02:38:33.670 --> 02:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
million in
 
02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
fy21 we not only have the 5% transfer of
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
$10 million but there is another statue
 
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
which is um the RSA 126 AA colon 3 where
 
02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
HHS can request uh additional funds if
 
02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the granted Advantage fund is running
 
02:38:55.389 --> 02:38:55.399 align:start position:0%
short so this year they're requesting an
 
02:38:58.510 --> 02:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
additional $8.5 million be transferred
 
02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
for a total of $18.5 million being
 
02:39:04.349 --> 02:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
transferred to HHS Which is less um
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's being transferred to the general
 
02:39:08.269 --> 02:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
fund and you can see that whole
 
02:39:14.070 --> 02:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
breakdown on um slide nine so in
 
02:39:18.910 --> 02:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
fy21 we're projecting to transfer $129
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
million to the general fund um for
 
02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
liquor and wine 13.2 million for the
 
02:39:26.830 --> 02:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
beer transfer and then we're
 
02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
transferring the 18.5 million to HHS the
 
02:39:35.790 --> 02:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
fy22 and 23 projections only include the
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
5% so about the $10 million because we
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
um we might have um Health and Human
 
02:39:45.070 --> 02:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
Services asking within each of those
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal years for additional funds but
 
02:39:49.389 --> 02:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
for now we have to only put in what's
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
5% so if we go to slide 10 we wanted to
 
02:40:03.790 --> 02:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
provide um a breakdown of our sales you
 
02:40:08.269 --> 02:40:08.279 align:start position:0%
have for fy6 you want to you to slide
 
02:40:10.309 --> 02:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
slide nine oh I'm
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I was flipping my page and I
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
didn't flip okay so I'll go back this is
 
02:40:18.830 --> 02:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
the slide that shows the breakdown for
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:24.349 --> 02:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
transfers so you can see the transfer
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:34.950 --> 02:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
136.34 for beer tax and then the 10.9
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
for HHS I'm sorry I forgot to turn the
 
02:40:41.590 --> 02:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
page and that 10.9 is just an estimated
 
02:40:44.670 --> 02:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
number right 5% of the prior year gross
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
profit you can see in fy21 the estimated
 
02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
number and the additional number
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
that they've asked for on the previous
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
slide making up the $8 million5
 
02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:59.230 align:start position:0%
slide making up the $8 million5
18.5

02:40:59.230 --> 02:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
18.5
 
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the next two slides we just
 
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide um some of our sales
 
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
breakdown so on this slide you can see
 
02:41:12.910 --> 02:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
fy6 to 20 our retail and on premise
 
02:41:16.110 --> 02:41:16.120 align:start position:0%
sales um for fy20 were higher than
 
02:41:18.389 --> 02:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
normal and on premise was down due to
 
02:41:22.510 --> 02:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
um fy20 retail was
 
02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
158.3 Million up 46.5 million or
 
02:41:34.469 --> 02:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
88.7% off premise was 114 million up 5.5
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
million or 5% and on premise was 62.2
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:47.349 --> 02:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
19% we go to excuse me
 
02:41:51.269 --> 02:41:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:53.510 --> 02:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
this um slide shows the breakdown by
 
02:41:55.990 --> 02:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
spirits and wine category by our re by
 
02:41:58.790 --> 02:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
our customer types so Spirit sales are
 
02:42:01.710 --> 02:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
60% of our business at
 
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
44.4 million in fy20 retail is 90% of
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
that at 410 million on premise is 9%
 
02:42:14.309 --> 02:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
42.1 million and off- premise is 1% or
 
02:42:17.429 --> 02:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
2.3 million on the wine side they make
 
02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
up 40% of our business at 33.7 million
 
02:42:26.429 --> 02:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
retail is 56 or 172 million and off
 
02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
premise is 37% or 112 million and on
 
02:42:33.550 --> 02:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
premise is 7% or 20
 
02:42:36.910 --> 02:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
million and at this point I will hand it
 
02:42:38.389 --> 02:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
back over to the
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and just a just a note for for
 
02:42:44.790 --> 02:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
the committee is that we've seen our our
 
02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
off our off I'm sorry our on premise
 
02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
Partners vary between
 
02:42:55.150 --> 02:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
40% off to about 25% off so their sales
 
02:42:57.550 --> 02:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
have suffered tremendously as we all
 
02:42:59.230 --> 02:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
know the restaurants are struggling
 
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic so we've seen them
 
02:43:07.309 --> 02:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
off at as much as 45 46% and right at
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
this point they're off still by about
 
02:43:15.630 --> 02:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
25% so on slide 12 are Outlet locations
 
02:43:19.110 --> 02:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
we have 69 Outlets 60 are least to
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 520,000 Square ft we have
 
02:43:25.710 --> 02:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
nine state-owned Outlets that are listed

02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
and the state owned Outlets account for
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
about 160 million or
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
26% of our total sales and you'll see
 
02:43:41.550 --> 02:43:41.560 align:start position:0%

02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have of
 
02:48:02.469 --> 02:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr chairman questions from
 
02:48:02.479 --> 02:48:07.309 align:start position:0%
us thank you Mr chairman questions from
the

02:48:07.309 --> 02:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you Mr chairman um I was
 
02:48:18.309 --> 02:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
wondering how long it takes to pay off
 
02:48:22.830 --> 02:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
the B funding from the new stores and
 
02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
provide a net gain in the transferred
 
02:48:29.870 --> 02:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
profits the most of the new stores that
 
02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
we've done have been a partnership with
 
02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:37.120 align:start position:0%
the landlord so we amortize um the fit
 
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
up costs into our rent and that gets
 
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
paid off with additional square footage
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
over a 10year period the only stores
 
02:48:49.150 --> 02:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
that we've done that we own is the
 
02:48:51.469 --> 02:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
Portsmith store and the Hampton stores
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
that will be coming up so no longer do
 
02:48:56.950 --> 02:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
we do we ask for appropriation to build
 
02:48:58.590 --> 02:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
these stores we partner with our
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
business partners our landlord we add
 
02:49:04.150 --> 02:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
about between
 
02:49:06.670 --> 02:49:06.680 align:start position:0%
$220 to
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
$268 a square foot on the first 10 years
 
02:49:13.469 --> 02:49:13.479 align:start position:0%
of our 20-year lease then that that cost
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
is paid off a lot of the times our rent
 
02:49:17.870 --> 02:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
goes down and we continue for our
 
02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
20-year lease so there's no output of
 
02:49:23.349 --> 02:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
cash from the state or the Liquor
 
02:49:25.510 --> 02:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
Commission to build these stores it's
 
02:49:27.910 --> 02:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
all done on a squarep put percentage
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
basis that's added into the cost of our
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
lease for the first 10
 
02:49:40.710 --> 02:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
Tucker representative Tucker you have to
 
02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:46.030 align:start position:0%
Tucker representative Tucker you have to
unmute

02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
yourself thank you um
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
could you tell me how you are managing
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
to do so well against the Massachusetts
 
02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
stores a couple of years ago you talked
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
about how Massachusetts has changed its
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint towards liquor and had become
 
02:50:10.190 --> 02:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
much more competitive and how is that
 
02:50:11.950 --> 02:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
working for New Hampshire and
 
02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:13.710 align:start position:0%
working for New Hampshire and
Massachusetts

02:50:13.710 --> 02:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
02:50:17.349 --> 02:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
together well uh it's it's not working
 
02:50:20.550 --> 02:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
together representative uh quite frankly
 
02:50:23.750 --> 02:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh we are in competition with them uh
 
02:50:27.030 --> 02:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
when Governor uh Patrick was in he
 
02:50:29.710 --> 02:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
changed the liquor license owning liquor
 
02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
licenses in uh Massachusetts from three
 
02:50:37.750 --> 02:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
licenses up to 10 in 2020 so that that
 
02:50:39.790 --> 02:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
brought in Total Wine and Spirits the
 
02:50:42.510 --> 02:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
furthest North they had been at that
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
point was Connecticut they have six
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
stores in Mass Massachusetts now they
 
02:50:47.760 --> 02:50:49.190 align:start position:0%
stores in Mass Massachusetts now they
have

02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:50:52.910 --> 02:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
213 stores nationwide and they do over
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
$3 billion in sales a year but they are
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
a private label uh retailer so they they
 
02:51:05.070 --> 02:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
come up with their own labels their own
 
02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
wines and they put them in their stores
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
they do carry nationally advertised
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
Brands like the New Hampshire liquor and
 
02:51:15.429 --> 02:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
wine outlets do but they're not nearly
 
02:51:18.190 --> 02:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
as competitive in pricing as as we have
 
02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
been able to be when they first came
 
02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
into the market they were they were
 
02:51:25.950 --> 02:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
running a lot of lost leaders which was
 
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
driving some of our traffic cross border
 
02:51:30.870 --> 02:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
but you can only do that for a period of
 
02:51:33.229 --> 02:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
time there was a number of lawsuits in
 
02:51:36.030 --> 02:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts against them some some
 
02:51:38.389 --> 02:51:38.399 align:start position:0%
they prevailed some they didn't but they
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
were selling product below cost which
 
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
they can no longer do uh obviously our
 
02:51:47.870 --> 02:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
branding initiative started 10 years ago
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
so we
 
02:51:51.309 --> 02:51:51.319 align:start position:0%
were ahead of them being in
 
02:51:54.190 --> 02:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh our brand is recognized
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
our value is recognized and we still we
 
02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
still as a retailer recognize that over
 
02:52:04.870 --> 02:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
50% of our business comes from crossb
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
and about 23% of that is from
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so we clearly Market to
 
02:52:13.870 --> 02:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
that uh to to those individuals in
 
02:52:17.150 --> 02:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we welcome them coming
 
02:52:21.790 --> 02:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
Set uh thank you Mr chairman and I'm not
 
02:52:26.910 --> 02:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
too sure if the commissioner is prepared
 
02:52:28.190 --> 02:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
for this question but I'm just
 
02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
reflecting back to what was just asked
 
02:52:32.630 --> 02:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
of Lottery and uh first of all thank you
 
02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
for the great job that that the Liquor
 
02:52:37.590 --> 02:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
Commission is doing but I'm curious if
 
02:52:41.229 --> 02:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
you track in any way problem
 
02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
drinking and and if you could maybe uh
 
02:52:47.389 --> 02:52:47.399 align:start position:0%
give us a little background on that if
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
that is the case
 
02:52:52.510 --> 02:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
well all of that is tracked and any
 
02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
information that we get is is tracked
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
through our enforcement Division and I'd
 
02:53:00.429 --> 02:53:00.439 align:start position:0%
be happy to share the information that
 
02:53:02.670 --> 02:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
we have that's public information with
 
02:53:04.469 --> 02:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
the committee but it's not something
 
02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
that I have in front of me here at this
 
02:53:10.190 --> 02:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
moment thank you so much so you can

which won't be too too far from now okay
 
02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh any further
 
02:53:22.710 --> 02:53:22.720 align:start position:0%

together and we recognize uh how
 
02:53:39.870 --> 02:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
important we are to the state as a
 
02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
revenue source and we take that uh that
 
02:53:45.389 --> 02:53:45.399 align:start position:0%

02:53:57.550 --> 02:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
back at one
 
02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
o'clock to listen to the judicial branch
 
02:54:02.590 --> 02:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
followed by the Department of Health and
 
02:54:05.469 --> 02:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
Human Services and securities and then
 
02:54:07.229 --> 02:54:07.239 align:start position:0%
the Department of

Justice and Brad we recommend that they
 
02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
don't leave the system but uh yeah I
 
02:54:19.150 --> 02:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
would recommend that people just mute
 
02:54:21.550 --> 02:54:21.560 align:start position:0%

apologize um but thank you um I am the
 
04:07:04.229 --> 04:07:04.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal manager for the judicial branch
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
and also with us today is Chris keading
 
04:07:08.590 --> 04:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
the director of the administrative
 
04:07:10.110 --> 04:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
office of the courts we are not in the
 
04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
same room together um we are both
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
working remotely I believe uh thank you
 
04:07:18.670 --> 04:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
again for an opportunity to discuss our
 
04:07:21.189 --> 04:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
um our revenues that are
 
04:07:23.950 --> 04:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
unrestricted uh we certainly don't have
 
04:07:27.710 --> 04:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
the revenue volumes that um some of our
 
04:07:30.149 --> 04:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
other agencies have I was listening to
 
04:07:32.950 --> 04:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
liquor presentation and lotteries but
 
04:07:34.750 --> 04:07:34.760 align:start position:0%
you know I'd like to think every penny
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
counts we're more around the $13 million
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
range each year but I thought I would
 
04:07:43.550 --> 04:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
start by just providing an overview of
 
04:07:45.870 --> 04:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
the different types of unrestricted
 
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
revenues that the court collect and if
 
04:07:50.189 --> 04:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
certainly if you have any questions um
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
chime in and then we would just discuss
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
um the past fiveyear history of those
 
04:07:58.750 --> 04:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
revenues and what factors we think will
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
influence um our projections for the
 
04:08:01.040 --> 04:08:03.950 align:start position:0%
influence um our projections for the
upcoming

04:08:03.950 --> 04:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:03.960 --> 04:08:05.710 align:start position:0%
 
bium

04:08:05.710 --> 04:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
bium
 
04:08:09.790 --> 04:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
so the judicial branch uh consists of
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
supreme Superior and circuit courts and
 
04:08:15.830 --> 04:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
we collect revenues through um a number
 
04:08:19.710 --> 04:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
of different means but primarily fines
 
04:08:22.510 --> 04:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
as well as entry fees to file motions
 
04:08:25.469 --> 04:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
requests and other things we also have a
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
fairly significant portion of
 
04:08:29.670 --> 04:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue revenues that we
 
04:08:32.349 --> 04:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
call other that are primarily records
 
04:08:32.359 --> 04:08:34.389 align:start position:0%
call other that are primarily records
research

04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
research
 
04:08:37.229 --> 04:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
fees so in terms of the fines that we
 
04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
collect it's primarily motor vehicle and
 
04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
criminal fines both we and the
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
department of safety collect motor
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle F uh if you get a plea by mail
 
04:08:50.830 --> 04:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fine you have the option
 
04:08:52.590 --> 04:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
to just pay the fine directly to the
 
04:08:55.030 --> 04:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety in which case that
 
04:08:57.630 --> 04:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue shows up on their book but if
 
04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
you choose to contest your fine or if
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
the fine is such that you cannot pay it
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
via plea by mail you then will get um a
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
court date and then you can State your
 
04:09:10.269 --> 04:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
case and if you are found guilty then
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
the courts will collect that that
 
04:09:12.359 --> 04:09:15.590 align:start position:0%
the courts will collect that that
Revenue

04:09:15.590 --> 04:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
we also impose criminal
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
fines and those fines can be collected
 
04:09:23.429 --> 04:09:23.439 align:start position:0%
directly at the courts or if the court
 
04:09:26.429 --> 04:09:26.439 align:start position:0%
has so ordered the fine um will be
 
04:09:28.030 --> 04:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
collected by the Department of
 
04:09:30.109 --> 04:09:30.119 align:start position:0%
Correction via one of their field
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
offices when that takes place I believe
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
the process is every two weeks um an
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
electronic file is sent over to the
 
04:09:40.429 --> 04:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
court indicating the case and the amount
 
04:09:42.590 --> 04:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
of money that were that was collected on
 
04:09:45.309 --> 04:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
that case and then our court staff
 
04:09:47.910 --> 04:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
manually enter that information on our
 
04:09:49.550 --> 04:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
books so the revenue is actually
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
reported on our books but it is
 
04:09:55.590 --> 04:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:58.349 --> 04:09:58.359 align:start position:0%
Correction in terms of fines there are
 
04:10:00.510 --> 04:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
penalty assessments that are levied on
 
04:10:02.670 --> 04:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
many of our fines uh for criminal
 
04:10:05.550 --> 04:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
offenses motor vehicle um as well as
 
04:10:08.790 --> 04:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
violations of Municipal ordinances and
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment is $2 or 24% of the
 
04:10:13.710 --> 04:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
fine I don't know that we've ever had a
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
fine that would get you a $2 penalty
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
assessment usually your fine is in the
 
04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
$100 or up range so on a $100 fine the
 
04:10:23.990 --> 04:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment would be $24 the
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
total fee you would pay is
 
04:10:29.309 --> 04:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
$124 of that the $100 is the fine
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
portion goes to the general fund the
 
04:10:35.229 --> 04:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment portion of it splits
 
04:10:41.109 --> 04:10:41.119 align:start position:0%
So currently um 66 or 23% of the penalty
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
assessment is deposited to the general
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
fund and that is as of fiscal year
 
04:10:49.309 --> 04:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
2017 uh it used to be that that portion
 
04:10:51.429 --> 04:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
of the penalty assessment went to police
 
04:10:53.950 --> 04:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
standards and training but with the
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
declining Revenue in general of penalty
 
04:10:58.910 --> 04:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
assessment it was becoming difficult for
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
um police standards and training to have
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
enough Revenue to support its operations
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
as a result they are now I believe 100%
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
generally funded so we send that Revenue
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
now to the general fund to help offset
 
04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
what the general fund uh provides to
 
04:11:14.510 --> 04:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
police ERS and training for them to
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
operate the other 2third um is split
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
evenly so one excuse me the other
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
onethird so um half of that goes to the
 
04:11:27.070 --> 04:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
judicial branches it dedicated fund and
 
04:11:28.910 --> 04:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
the other half of it goes to Department
 
04:11:31.990 --> 04:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
of Justice's victims assistance fund and
 
04:11:35.309 --> 04:11:35.319 align:start position:0%
just as an aside um the it dedicated
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
fund um has recently as well had its
 
04:11:40.309 --> 04:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
share of issues in terms of having
 
04:11:42.109 --> 04:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
adequate revenues to support its
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
operations and that has been documented
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
in the last few annual it dedicated fund
 
04:11:49.469 --> 04:11:49.479 align:start position:0%
reports that we have filed with the
 
04:11:52.750 --> 04:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
legislature um the we had proposed a few
 
04:11:55.030 --> 04:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
different solutions to that ultimately
 
04:11:57.870 --> 04:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
it was decided that General funds would
 
04:12:00.149 --> 04:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
augment the shortfall so that has
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
happened in this last bium and we are
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
bium so in terms of um collection
 
04:12:14.189 --> 04:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness so we are not a collection
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
agency however we do have issues with
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
people not paying their fines so we have
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
a few mechanisms that we employ to try
 
04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
to get people to pay what they are owed
 
04:12:24.750 --> 04:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
state um so individuals who pay fail to
 
04:12:30.189 --> 04:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
pay court-ordered motor vehicle fines
 
04:12:32.309 --> 04:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
are defaulted so their license is
 
04:12:34.590 --> 04:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
suspended so Department of Safety will
 
04:12:36.469 --> 04:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
send a warning notice to the
 
04:12:39.510 --> 04:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
individual if they continue to not pay
 
04:12:41.070 --> 04:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
then their driver's license and
 
04:12:43.630 --> 04:12:43.640 align:start position:0%
registration are suspended we also have
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocity in a lot of States so if
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
they're actually not from this state and
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
they still get the fine we can suspend
 
04:12:50.830 --> 04:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
their license in the state in which they
 
04:12:53.830 --> 04:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
hold their license and if they are
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
defaulted there is a $50 administration
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
fee that needs to be paid um to to clear
 
04:13:00.000 --> 04:13:02.070 align:start position:0%
fee that needs to be paid um to to clear
that

04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:13:04.510 --> 04:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
default in terms of other types of
 
04:13:08.109 --> 04:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
collection Effectiveness um we do also
 
04:13:11.189 --> 04:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
issue arrest orders um for unpaid fines
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
in misdemeanor and spell IND cas cases
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
there is a um a electronic repository of
 
04:13:18.670 --> 04:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
that information that a police officer
 
04:13:21.469 --> 04:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
can look up uh and act on it if he
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
becomes aware of it uh and then we also
 
04:13:27.070 --> 04:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
try to discourage Time payments again
 
04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
you're taking your fund you're splitting
 
04:13:29.950 --> 04:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
it up into smaller pieces we try to
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
discourage that um and in so doing we
 
04:13:34.469 --> 04:13:34.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully lower the uncollected fine
 
04:13:35.950 --> 04:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
balance and we shorten the average
 
04:13:35.960 --> 04:13:38.870 align:start position:0%
balance and we shorten the average
collection

04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.109 --> 04:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
time entry fees is another big part of
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted revenues that the
 
04:13:46.429 --> 04:13:46.439 align:start position:0%
courts collect they are set by Court
 
04:13:48.389 --> 04:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
rule so they are not set in statute the
 
04:13:51.309 --> 04:13:51.319 align:start position:0%
courts determine the entry fee amounts
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
and they range um from $45 to around
 
04:13:59.309 --> 04:13:59.319 align:start position:0%
$225 and small claims is very common uh
 
04:14:01.710 --> 04:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
civil cases family landlord tenant those
 
04:14:03.790 --> 04:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
types of um entry fees are very common
 
04:14:04.750 --> 04:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
court and 64% of Entry fees are
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
deposited to the general fund and then
 
04:14:14.950 --> 04:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
the remaining 36% um is split two ways
 
04:14:17.710 --> 04:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
30% goes to the it dedicated
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
fund again which the judicial branch
 
04:14:22.229 --> 04:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
controls and then six% is sent to
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
facilities escrow and that is also on
 
04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
our book and Facilities escrow is just
 
04:14:30.550 --> 04:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
money that's there in case we have some
 
04:14:33.429 --> 04:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
um type of facilities um Improvement or
 
04:14:35.309 --> 04:14:35.319 align:start position:0%
repair that needs to get done and there
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
are no other funds for it we will go to
 
04:14:39.269 --> 04:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
that Fund in conjunction with on the
 
04:14:42.030 --> 04:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Courts
 
04:14:42.040 --> 04:14:43.830 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Courts
facilities

04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
04:14:47.550 --> 04:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
um just as a note um some filing fees
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
can be waved that will affect revenues
 
04:14:52.590 --> 04:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
um judges have the option to wave filing
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
fees if a person can demonstrate that
 
04:14:58.189 --> 04:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
they cannot afford uh to pay their fee
 
04:15:00.309 --> 04:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
because again this is about access to
 
04:15:03.109 --> 04:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
Justice uh We've also noted uh when we
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
do increase Revenue uh filing fee amount
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
it tends to result in an increased
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
number of requests for a waiver of the
 
04:15:13.790 --> 04:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
fee I believe the last time we
 
04:15:19.149 --> 04:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
increased our filing fees was back in
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
2014 I want to say I'm not exactly sure
 
04:15:23.070 --> 04:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
but it's been a while since we've
 
04:15:26.670 --> 04:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
actually adjusted um filing fee
 
04:15:29.309 --> 04:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
amounts and then as I mentioned earlier
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
another big portion of our unrestricted
 
04:15:34.750 --> 04:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
revenues falls into what we call other
 
04:15:37.469 --> 04:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
fees and right now records research fees
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
it ranges between probably 65 and
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
75% of what deposits to other fees and
 
04:15:46.389 --> 04:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
as I've noted in the last proba few
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
years of giving this presentation uh
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
before house weighs and means there has
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
been talk of making online uh public
 
04:15:59.510 --> 04:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
access to um to records research fees
 
04:16:02.229 --> 04:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
and that would obviously affect our our
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
ability to collect revenue for it so
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
just wanted to put that out there again
 
04:16:07.229 --> 04:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard anything that's really
 
04:16:09.469 --> 04:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
happening with it but it may be
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
something we'll be dealing with in the
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
future and then motions and petitions
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
are another portion of what deposits
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
into other fees and those range from
 
04:16:22.990 --> 04:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
$250 we also charge a $25 search charge
 
04:16:31.149 --> 04:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
on many of our civil and family case um
 
04:16:33.870 --> 04:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
filings but we don't in certain case
 
04:16:36.990 --> 04:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
types so criminal juvenile um small
 
04:16:39.109 --> 04:16:39.119 align:start position:0%
claims domestic violence those types of
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
things but that $25 search charge again
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
deposits to the general find in this
 
04:16:47.510 --> 04:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
other fees category we also charge a $25
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
setup fee for Time payments that also
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
deposits um as unrestricted fees in in
 
04:16:56.070 --> 04:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
this other fees
 
04:16:58.710 --> 04:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
category this next slide is just a
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
summary of the different types of
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues that the court
 
04:17:06.149 --> 04:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
collect by um revenue account and a
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
description of it with some history as
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
well and next slide is sort of the year
 
04:17:15.870 --> 04:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
history of these different um
 
04:17:19.309 --> 04:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue streams and I did a
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
compound annual growth rate as well to
 
04:17:25.510 --> 04:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
kind of gauge how the funds have done
 
04:17:27.550 --> 04:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
and default fees collected by safety
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
have actually remained fairly stable and
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
again that's the $50 fee similar to ours
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
that if you've defaulted if you paid
 
04:17:36.950 --> 04:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
safety with a bad check or something in
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
order to reinstate you have to pay that
 
04:17:41.910 --> 04:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
$50 fee so again it's remained
 
04:17:44.309 --> 04:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
remarkably stable um over the last five
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
years bar exam fees I think also for the
 
04:17:49.309 --> 04:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
most part will remain the same and just
 
04:17:51.590 --> 04:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
as a caveat I think the name of that
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
account is bar exam fees we do not
 
04:17:56.070 --> 04:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
actually collect the fees for the bar
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
exam any longer but there are I think
 
04:18:02.990 --> 04:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
$10 fees for a um an a good standing
 
04:18:05.229 --> 04:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
that the courts require if you're going
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
to litigate a case in this state that
 
04:18:09.309 --> 04:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
type of thing that's what that revenue
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
is and then uh the E filing search
 
04:18:16.590 --> 04:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
charge that's either a 10 or $20 SE
 
04:18:20.189 --> 04:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
charge that is tacked onto the um the
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
filing that is done
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
online and you can see sort of the the
 
04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
growth there though is due to ramp up so
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
you can see in fiscal year 2016 we had
 
04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
less case types that were online than
 
04:18:35.070 --> 04:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
you had in 18 19 and 20 and I think it's
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
kind of stabilized at this point New
 
04:18:39.990 --> 04:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has mandatory um filing for
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
those case types that are available
 
04:18:41.760 --> 04:18:43.269 align:start position:0%
those case types that are available
online

04:18:43.269 --> 04:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:18:46.670 --> 04:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
so now that we've had all the case types
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
that are going to be online for a while
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
I think you will see that remain fairly
 
04:18:52.349 --> 04:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
stable in the next couple of fiscal
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
years if we were to uh introduce other
 
04:18:57.070 --> 04:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
case types online you would then see an
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
increase in that Revenue stream interest
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
is obviously so small it doesn't really
 
04:19:04.510 --> 04:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
have much of an impact even though it
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
went from $33 in 2016 to about a dollar
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
into school year 20 I'm not too worried
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
about that decline um fines um have
 
04:19:16.510 --> 04:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
decreased uh around 20% year-over-year
 
04:19:18.389 --> 04:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
since fiscal year
 
04:19:20.830 --> 04:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
2016 one of the things that did have a
 
04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
big impact on that was what we called
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
the decriminalization of marijuana
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
because a lot of those fines that were
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
associated with um possession of
 
04:19:35.469 --> 04:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
marijuana were fairly High $500 and up
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
with the um decriminalization of
 
04:19:40.990 --> 04:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana even when there is a fine
 
04:19:42.870 --> 04:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
involved it tends to be much smaller so
 
04:19:45.149 --> 04:19:45.159 align:start position:0%
it did have quite a significant impact
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
um you can see between fiscal year 17
 
04:19:50.429 --> 04:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year 18 and then a little bit
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
more into
 
04:19:55.550 --> 04:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
19 the next category is bail forfeiture
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
and that one is a little hard to predict
 
04:20:00.269 --> 04:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
because that's all dependent upon human
 
04:20:02.349 --> 04:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
behavior who forfeits their bail because
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
they didn't show up for their court
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
hearing so I don't really know how one
 
04:20:07.670 --> 04:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
can predict that very well so but it's
 
04:20:11.070 --> 04:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
around it's range from2 you know
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
$76,000 to around 111,000 but again it
 
04:20:16.030 --> 04:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
will vary I think year to year tough to
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
predict that one entry fees um have
 
04:20:22.510 --> 04:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
remained fairly stable again I think at
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
the onset of the pandemic the first few
 
04:20:27.389 --> 04:20:27.399 align:start position:0%
months throughout April May and June I
 
04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
think everybody was reeling from the
 
04:20:32.189 --> 04:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
impact of it trying to adjust and
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
understand uh how it would impact things
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
so we did see a dip um in fiscal year 20
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the last quarter but I think we're
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
starting to see them rebound
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
um those things have stabilized a bit
 
04:20:47.710 --> 04:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
default fees collected by the courts
 
04:20:51.349 --> 04:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
again that's that $50 excuse me $50 fee
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
should somebody um pay their Court fine
 
04:20:57.070 --> 04:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
with a bad check or not show up for
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
their hearing whatever they have to pay
 
04:21:00.710 --> 04:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
that additional $50
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
fee other fees again that has remained
 
04:21:08.469 --> 04:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
um remarkably strong I think um over uh
 
04:21:11.790 --> 04:21:11.800 align:start position:0%
the fiscal years and I think part of it
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
is I think the economy has done still
 
04:21:17.109 --> 04:21:17.119 align:start position:0%
fairly well and we've all suffered
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic but I think New
 
04:21:21.790 --> 04:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has fared fairly well um and
 
04:21:23.790 --> 04:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
also in terms of housing I think housing
 
04:21:26.109 --> 04:21:26.119 align:start position:0%
remains strong and so records research
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
fees are requested I think a lot of
 
04:21:31.670 --> 04:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
times for um looking to rent to somebody
 
04:21:34.349 --> 04:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
or looking to hire someone so we've seen
 
04:21:37.109 --> 04:21:37.119 align:start position:0%
fairly stable in that line and then
 
04:21:39.189 --> 04:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
there's uh miscellaneous sales and
 
04:21:41.870 --> 04:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
revenue and that has actually gone down
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
quite a bit and that was due to a change
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
in our procedure with those funds um it
 
04:21:50.950 --> 04:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
used to be that we would um we would
 
04:21:52.830 --> 04:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
have funds that were unclaimed so people
 
04:21:55.149 --> 04:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
paid bail or whatever they paid and for
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
whatever reason we couldn't locate the
 
04:21:58.990 --> 04:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
owner of that money it used to be that
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
after three tries of not being able to
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
locate the owner we would automatically
 
04:22:05.510 --> 04:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
send that money over as Revenue to the
 
04:22:07.149 --> 04:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
general fund in this miscellaneous
 
04:22:09.389 --> 04:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
revenue account we realized then that we
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
were not following statutes as regard to
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
how we should be treating that money we
 
04:22:17.710 --> 04:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
now as of November um
 
04:22:20.670 --> 04:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
2017 we hold that money as unclaimed for
 
04:22:23.630 --> 04:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
three years in an escrow account then if
 
04:22:25.630 --> 04:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
we were not able to locate the owner
 
04:22:27.630 --> 04:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
after that three-year period it then
 
04:22:30.070 --> 04:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
becomes abandoned property right and
 
04:22:32.830 --> 04:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
then it will deposit to the general fund
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're now getting to that three-year
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
Mark and we actually did an analysis
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
last week we don't have any monies
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
actually in the next few months uh we've
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
been able to return funds to people but
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
in April we're going to have money that
 
04:22:47.229 --> 04:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
has aged three years and will then be
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
deposited to the general fund and you'll
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
see on the next slide I've been able to
 
04:22:53.309 --> 04:22:53.319 align:start position:0%
do an analysis to get a sense of the
 
04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
most that we would send to the general
 
04:22:57.389 --> 04:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
fund obviously I think between now and
 
04:22:58.990 --> 04:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
the time these funds become three years
 
04:23:00.670 --> 04:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to locate some more owners
 
04:23:02.750 --> 04:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
so the money the the amounts may come
 
04:23:05.109 --> 04:23:05.119 align:start position:0%
down a little bit but that's why you see
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
that drop it was a change in
 
04:23:10.349 --> 04:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
procedure and then uh penalty
 
04:23:13.469 --> 04:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
assessments again um we have seen just a
 
04:23:16.309 --> 04:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
steady decline you see a zero in 2016
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
because again that money was actually um
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
going to police standards and training
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
so it was not hitting uh unrestricted
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue but as of 2017 it did and we
 
04:23:28.389 --> 04:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
have seen a steady decline and penalty
 
04:23:30.510 --> 04:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
assessments and I know I get asked every
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
year why I think that is um and it's I'm
 
04:23:36.990 --> 04:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
sure it's a combination of things um it
 
04:23:38.750 --> 04:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
may be you know raising the speed limit
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
in some parts of the state to 70 miles
 
04:23:42.630 --> 04:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
an hour maybe less tickets are being um
 
04:23:46.189 --> 04:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
issued as a result of that um are you
 
04:23:48.429 --> 04:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
know as we are a fairly gray state are
 
04:23:50.469 --> 04:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
we getting better behaved as we get
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
older I I don't know but um we just I
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
cannot obviously deny that there is a
 
04:23:57.710 --> 04:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
general Trend here of declining
 
04:24:00.389 --> 04:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
revenues and then the last Revenue that
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
we collect is the motor vehicle fines um
 
04:24:05.149 --> 04:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
again if you have a f by mail that you
 
04:24:07.109 --> 04:24:07.119 align:start position:0%
want to contest or you can't pay your
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
fine by ple by mail you have to pay it
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
at the court uh and we have seen again a
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
stady the CL even pre pandemic obviously
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
I think the the pandemic has affected
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
the number of vehicles on the road
 
04:24:21.870 --> 04:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
significantly I think a lot of people
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
myself included are working from home
 
04:24:26.550 --> 04:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
quite a bit so we have seen um you know
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
an impact to that Revenue stream as a
 
04:24:30.910 --> 04:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
result of just more people being home
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic so our next slide then looks at
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh where we project uh revenues to be
 
04:24:41.550 --> 04:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
for the through the end of this fiscal
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
year as as well as 22 and
 
04:24:47.229 --> 04:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
23 and as I kind of alluded to I think
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
some of these revenue streams are more
 
04:24:51.309 --> 04:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to the effects of the
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic event others um I think motor
 
04:24:57.189 --> 04:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle type um amounts are going to be
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
more impacted you can see it and
 
04:25:02.389 --> 04:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
defaults collected by safety and our
 
04:25:04.750 --> 04:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fines um safety is
 
04:25:08.030 --> 04:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
projecting for fiscal year 21 $688,000
 
04:25:10.750 --> 04:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
in revenues as opposed to they're around
 
04:25:14.910 --> 04:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
800 plus thousand each year um bar exam
 
04:25:16.109 --> 04:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
fees again I don't think is going to be
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
impacted all that much again e filing I
 
04:25:21.109 --> 04:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
think will also be fairly immune because
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
it is online by
 
04:25:27.630 --> 04:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
Nature um and then for fines I looked at
 
04:25:30.149 --> 04:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
sort of a general trend for the last
 
04:25:31.910 --> 04:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
three years to see what might be
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
happening in terms of it and I did the
 
04:25:37.510 --> 04:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
same thing with fail forfeitures again
 
04:25:40.149 --> 04:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
very difficult to predict on that one
 
04:25:43.750 --> 04:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
entry fees I'm hoping will stay I again
 
04:25:46.750 --> 04:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh I I just think we had a a severe hit
 
04:25:49.950 --> 04:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
in the last quarter of fiscal year 20
 
04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
but now I think we're we're kind of
 
04:25:54.429 --> 04:25:54.439 align:start position:0%
going into an upward trend on that and
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll stabilize in the next
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
year or two with that uh default fees
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
collected by the courts again little
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
tough to predict I'm looking at around
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
the 120 range to be
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
conservative uh other fees again that's
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of Records research which has
 
04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
continued to be strong
 
04:26:15.590 --> 04:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm actually looking at a fairly
 
04:26:18.189 --> 04:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
healthy return on that um for this
 
04:26:21.389 --> 04:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and there might be I'm
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe a little bit of a
 
04:26:24.910 --> 04:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
downward Trend in 22 and
 
04:26:27.349 --> 04:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
23 I just don't know I want I'd rather
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
be a little conservative to and see what
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
happens and be pleasantly surprised
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
rather than be too optimistic about uh
 
04:26:36.990 --> 04:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
what those revenues may come in at and
 
04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
then miscellaneous sales this is as I
 
04:26:41.070 --> 04:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
talked about before what you're seeing
 
04:26:44.590 --> 04:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
in 21 is as of today what's going to be
 
04:26:47.950 --> 04:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
three years old in fiscal year 21 and
 
04:26:50.109 --> 04:26:50.119 align:start position:0%
then for 22 around
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
$22,000 is going to be three years old
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
and then around 91,000 in fiscal year 23
 
04:26:57.870 --> 04:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
those that's a maximum amount those
 
04:26:59.389 --> 04:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
numbers will probably come down as I
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned as we find um owners of those
 
04:27:05.790 --> 04:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
funds and then penalty assessments again
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to see a bit of a a
 
04:27:12.710 --> 04:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
rebound I'm hoping um but the General
 
04:27:14.750 --> 04:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
overall trend with Pas is that they are
 
04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
coming down so I Tred to reflect that in
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
my 22 and 23 figures as well at some
 
04:27:21.750 --> 04:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
point though it's got to bottom out I
 
04:27:23.469 --> 04:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
just don't know where that bottom is
 
04:27:25.030 --> 04:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
I've just seen it year overy year
 
04:27:27.349 --> 04:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
continuing to decline but you would
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
think at some point you know it can't go
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
much further down if if people are if
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
police are giving out tickets and
 
04:27:37.269 --> 04:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
assessing other fines for things again I
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
just I don't know enough about all the
 
04:27:42.429 --> 04:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
drivers of that to to predict when it
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
may bottom out and then motor vehicle
 
04:27:49.070 --> 04:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
fines again there's a a general Trend
 
04:27:52.750 --> 04:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
downward um I'm hoping with fiscal year
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
21 again we're still seeing the impact
 
04:27:58.590 --> 04:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic in 22 I've raised the
 
04:28:01.070 --> 04:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
projection some of that I'm attributing
 
04:28:03.550 --> 04:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
to backlog the courts have obviously
 
04:28:06.149 --> 04:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
been challenged with um switching to
 
04:28:08.309 --> 04:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
remote models to conduct their business
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
so there was a big culture change and a
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
lot of technology that had to be
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
implemented to allow us to do that um
 
04:28:17.229 --> 04:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
but I think we're in a much better place
 
04:28:18.710 --> 04:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
to conduct our business but we still
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
have a lot of catch-up to do so there is
 
04:28:22.830 --> 04:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of backlog of cases and so
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that we will see an uptick in
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
revenues that follow the ability of the
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
courts to process those cases and get
 
04:28:30.149 --> 04:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
the revenue in but then I think
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately once we get done with that
 
04:28:33.550 --> 04:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
backlog we're probably going to see a
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
little bit of a decline again in
 
04:28:36.349 --> 04:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
revenues and that's why you see a
 
04:28:38.590 --> 04:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
difference between 22 and
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
23 and then the last page um is just
 
04:28:43.790 --> 04:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
foot about this I think most of them I
 
04:28:46.189 --> 04:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
talked about but just to help explain
 
04:28:48.189 --> 04:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
what what some of that revenue is about
 
04:28:51.550 --> 04:28:51.560 align:start position:0%
um and how it's distributed so if the
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee has any questions um direct
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
ping and I will be happy to answer
 
04:28:59.389 --> 04:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
them well thank you Donna very good
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee I do not see any raised
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
hands well right on time oh
 
04:29:19.309 --> 04:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
04:29:19.319 --> 04:29:21.309 align:start position:0%
right uh
represent

04:29:21.309 --> 04:29:21.319 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
Mary did you have a question yeah um
 
04:29:27.790 --> 04:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um if I could just
 
04:29:29.910 --> 04:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
ask quickly Donna about your slide
 
04:29:31.870 --> 04:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
waivers um you said that you've noticed
 
04:29:36.189 --> 04:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
that there's a bit of an increase in
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
waivers being granted by judges could
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
you speak a little bit about the
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
year-to-year trends that you're seeing
 
04:29:46.070 --> 04:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
I think that is more anecdotal um it's
 
04:29:48.070 --> 04:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
what we've heard from judges in their
 
04:29:50.269 --> 04:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
experience so I don't actually have data
 
04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
for that and I'm it's very difficult to
 
04:29:55.030 --> 04:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
um record that because we need to see
 
04:29:57.269 --> 04:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
what the actual sign was and that that
 
04:30:00.149 --> 04:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
information may be in our Odyssey case
 
04:30:02.269 --> 04:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
system but I'm not sure that it gets
 
04:30:05.630 --> 04:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
down to that level of granularity um but
 
04:30:08.070 --> 04:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
it it tends to make sense um that you
 
04:30:10.389 --> 04:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
know the more you start asking the for
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
you know payments the more people are
 
04:30:13.550 --> 04:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
going to come forward and say I can't
 
04:30:15.630 --> 04:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
afford this but I just wanted to put it
 
04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
out there that it it is part of the
 
04:30:21.670 --> 04:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
dynamic of uh revenues that we end up
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:30.510 --> 04:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions then I thank uh both Donner
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
and and Christopher for a presentation
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
on the judicial branch thank you we're
 
04:30:40.389 --> 04:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
right on time so we can start with the
 
04:30:44.670 --> 04:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:48.030 --> 04:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
and Karen rounds the chief financial
 
04:30:54.590 --> 04:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:57.109 --> 04:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
presentation good afternoon everyone I'm

screen and and Karen did you send over a
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
copy of your slides or I did I sent it
 
04:31:09.710 --> 04:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
over to Chris yesterday morning um so
 
04:31:11.590 --> 04:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if he sent that out via
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
email or uh has posted it to the website
 
04:31:15.550 --> 04:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
maybe he could chime in and just let you
 
04:31:18.149 --> 04:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
know that it is on the
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
website so all the presentations that
 
04:31:22.590 --> 04:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
you have scheduled today and tomorrow
 
04:31:23.950 --> 04:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
should all be on our
 
04:31:23.960 --> 04:31:27.070 align:start position:0%
should all be on our
website

04:31:27.070 --> 04:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
okay great and I will just apologize in
 
04:31:31.950 --> 04:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
advance you will hear uh background
 
04:31:34.229 --> 04:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
noise here I am at the state's emergency
 
04:31:36.870 --> 04:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
Operation Center so uh you will hear
 
04:31:41.309 --> 04:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
background noise um so this presentation
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh does not Encompass all of the
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
revenues for DHHS for a number of
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
reasons uh one um we have over 200
 
04:31:52.790 --> 04:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources the largest of which
 
04:31:56.710 --> 04:31:56.720 align:start position:0%
being the uh the Medicaid Program uh
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
which is in various accounting units all
 
04:32:02.070 --> 04:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
across our department um and then like I
 
04:32:04.269 --> 04:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
said there's over 200 total between
 
04:32:06.349 --> 04:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
small grants that there are 10 you know
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of dollars to larger
 
04:32:09.870 --> 04:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
grants that are tens of millions of
 
04:32:12.710 --> 04:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
dollars like the state OPI response
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
Grant um I did two years ago say that we
 
04:32:18.229 --> 04:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
were working on a report to show you all
 
04:32:21.070 --> 04:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
of those restricted Revenue sources uh
 
04:32:25.149 --> 04:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
covid has as you can imagine put a um a
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
bit of a damper on many of our longer
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
strategic planning projects and we
 
04:32:31.189 --> 04:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately did not have that
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
completed for this vium but I am hoping
 
04:32:36.670 --> 04:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
for next one when uh Co is hopefully in
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
our distant past so this um report here
 
04:32:43.750 --> 04:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh that I had prepared for you shows a
 
04:32:46.109 --> 04:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
number of things on this first section
 
04:32:48.149 --> 04:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm showing you here on the screen
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
on the left hand side is a chart of the
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
actuals and the right hand side is the
 
04:32:55.670 --> 04:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
chart of the budget note that it doesn't
 
04:32:59.309 --> 04:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
line up perfectly as far as uh um just
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
sort of following the chart because the
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
actuals ends at at fiscal year 20
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
because we are currently in fiscal year
 
04:33:07.510 --> 04:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
21 and the budget goes through to fiscal
 
04:33:07.520 --> 04:33:08.349 align:start position:0%
21 and the budget goes through to fiscal
year

04:33:08.349 --> 04:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:33:12.429 --> 04:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
23 a couple of things to note here um is
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
that you do see decreasing unrestricted
 
04:33:17.949 --> 04:33:17.959 align:start position:0%
Revenue over the past several years the
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
reason for that is a change in the uh
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
manage care contracts that the
 
04:33:25.869 --> 04:33:25.879 align:start position:0%
department has which are the contracts
 
04:33:28.789 --> 04:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
that manage our Medicaid Program and
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
that those contracts change the way um
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
that the uh recoveries are managed and
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
that the mcos the manag Care
 
04:33:41.349 --> 04:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
organizations are required to manage
 
04:33:44.310 --> 04:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
those recoveries within their work which
 
04:33:46.429 --> 04:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
results in a savings on the contract to
 
04:33:48.670 --> 04:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
the state but also a decrease in the
 
04:33:51.150 --> 04:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
amount of unrestricted Revenue so that's
 
04:33:53.189 --> 04:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
really what you see reflected here what
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'd also note here is that um one thing
 
04:33:59.709 --> 04:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
that's not included in the DHHS
 
04:34:02.429 --> 04:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue but is included in
 
04:34:05.869 --> 04:34:05.879 align:start position:0%
the other unrestricted Revenue um on
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
your overall unrestricted Revenue sheets
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
are the restaurant fees so um we do
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
provide estimates on that to uh the
 
04:34:16.629 --> 04:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
governor's office and to the LBA but
 
04:34:18.551 --> 04:34:18.561 align:start position:0%
those are not included in the line
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
that's labeled DHHS unrestricted
 
04:34:23.990 --> 04:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue um there's a couple of pie
 
04:34:26.310 --> 04:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
charts here just for visuals uh if you
 
04:34:28.750 --> 04:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at those later the
 
04:34:30.590 --> 04:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
other thing that we have here is all of
 
04:34:33.150 --> 04:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
the revenue sources
 
04:34:39.150 --> 04:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
um sorry over the uh past several years
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
um and you will see like we talked about
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
that decline in the recoveries happening
 
04:34:47.310 --> 04:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
over the past several years because of
 
04:34:49.949 --> 04:34:49.959 align:start position:0%
the change in the contracts otherwise
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
our other revenues and unrestricted
 
04:34:56.029 --> 04:34:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:00.070 --> 04:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
stable on this page um just to let you
 
04:35:02.070 --> 04:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
know what's in the other unrestricted
 
04:35:05.150 --> 04:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
revenues as you can see it is a various
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
amount of small fees um and
 
04:35:13.029 --> 04:35:13.039 align:start position:0%
expenditures there is also um just a
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
chart showing you again the unrestricted
 
04:35:17.789 --> 04:35:17.799 align:start position:0%
revenues of that 1.2 million that's
 
04:35:19.551 --> 04:35:19.561 align:start position:0%
various that that has decreased a little
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
bit over time but not
 
04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
substantially there's also on this last
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
page a description of each of the
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
revenue sources so I know this has been
 
04:35:30.269 --> 04:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
very high level I'm going to go ahead
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
and just scroll back up to the first
 
04:35:33.390 --> 04:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
page because I think these two charts
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
are probably the most helpful in your
 
04:35:38.310 --> 04:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
analysis um I also have several people
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
on the line who are familiar with each
 
04:35:42.029 --> 04:35:42.039 align:start position:0%
of the revenue sources who can provide
 
04:35:44.230 --> 04:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
more information um so I'm going to go
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
on mute for a few moments because I know
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
that I do have a ton of background noise
 
04:35:49.949 --> 04:35:49.959 align:start position:0%
here and give you guys a second just to
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
look at it and see if there are any
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative major I muted
 
04:35:57.990 --> 04:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
you I thought you were talking I'm sorry
 
04:36:04.140 --> 04:36:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.150 --> 04:36:05.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:36:05.390 --> 04:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:36:07.869 --> 04:36:07.879 align:start position:0%
yourself representative major I muted
 
04:36:10.709 --> 04:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
you I I thought you were on a phone call
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
elmy unmute
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
Susan I'm muted sorry um I can't figure
 
04:36:35.629 --> 04:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
out how chart one relates to chart two
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
the budget doesn't seem to be the same
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
as the unrestricted
 
04:36:43.709 --> 04:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue it's different numbers yep the
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
chart on the left is the actuals um the
 
04:36:49.230 --> 04:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
chart on the right is the budget so
 
04:36:51.310 --> 04:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
actuals have tended to Trend a little
 
04:36:53.629 --> 04:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
bit higher than what we've budgeted with
 
04:36:56.070 --> 04:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
the exception of um
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
2018 and 19 um if you look we came in at
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
about six million it was budgeted at 9
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
million that was a budgeting error that
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
year um last year in fiscal year 20 the
 
04:37:10.910 --> 04:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
actuals were about 4.8 million and you
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.269 --> 04:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
3.7 and in fiscal year 21 we are
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
trending to um to receive at least what
 
04:37:24.670 --> 04:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
is budgeted if not a little bit more uh
 
04:37:27.390 --> 04:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
you know there's a there's a joke that
 
04:37:29.310 --> 04:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
that's not a joke but it is that you
 
04:37:32.230 --> 04:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
occasionally hear that in HHS um a half
 
04:37:35.390 --> 04:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
a million dollars is a rounding error uh
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
and so for us um you know this coming in
 
04:37:40.109 --> 04:37:40.119 align:start position:0%
where it is and like I said where you
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
expect this will be a little bit higher
 
04:37:44.510 --> 04:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
um but it's not like tens of millions of
 
04:37:46.670 --> 04:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
dollars higher maybe it'll be a couple
 
04:37:46.680 --> 04:37:52.670 align:start position:0%
dollars higher maybe it'll be a couple
hundred

04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:56.830 --> 04:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
thousand you said that in
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
2018 the budgeted amount was
 
04:38:03.150 --> 04:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
wrong what would it
 
04:38:06.670 --> 04:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
be it should have been closer to this we
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
probably would have budgeted it at about
 
04:38:10.990 --> 04:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
5 million um it came in at about 6
 
04:38:11.000 --> 04:38:11.949 align:start position:0%
5 million um it came in at about 6
million

04:38:11.949 --> 04:38:11.959 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:38:15.789 --> 04:38:15.799 align:start position:0%
that was uh that
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
was uh a double budgeting issue that we
 
04:38:20.789 --> 04:38:20.799 align:start position:0%
made when we submitted the governor's
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
budget that was not caught through the
 
04:38:24.629 --> 04:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
phases part of the recoveries are
 
04:38:26.429 --> 04:38:26.439 align:start position:0%
actually federal funds it's not just
 
04:38:29.189 --> 04:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
general funds so we recover twice the
 
04:38:31.070 --> 04:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
amount but we have to return a portion
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
of that to the federal government so 19
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
be the same case too right yes it was 18
 
04:38:39.709 --> 04:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
and 19 that that budget error was made
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
that those were both budgeted at 9 .1
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
6.2 all right strange that you would
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.070 --> 04:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh further questions representative
 
04:38:59.629 --> 04:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
Elliot yes uh Mr chairman I was
 
04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
wondering I could hear Karen's voice and
 
04:39:04.590 --> 04:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
I could also hear a man's voice I'm
 
04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
getting two voices on my computer has
 
04:39:13.590 --> 04:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:15.470 --> 04:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
no sir that's me I'm sorry I'm at the
 
04:39:17.189 --> 04:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
state's emergency Operation Center
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
you're hearing Perry plumber in the
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
background with the commissioner I'm
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
sorry about that thank you Karen that
 
04:39:22.160 --> 04:39:26.269 align:start position:0%
sorry about that thank you Karen that
explains

04:39:26.269 --> 04:39:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
Aly you have to unmute Susan sorry I
 
04:39:36.789 --> 04:39:36.799 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that
 
04:39:38.910 --> 04:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy had a question
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
about the uh distribution of the net
 
04:39:43.708 --> 04:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
money and we were told that maybe this
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
afternoon she could deal with
 
04:39:49.390 --> 04:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
it yes I'm going to go ahead and stop
 
04:39:52.708 --> 04:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
sharing and allow uh Chris to bring
 
04:39:55.350 --> 04:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
Meredith um and Brooke into the
 
04:39:56.788 --> 04:39:56.798 align:start position:0%
conversation because they are better
 
04:39:58.550 --> 04:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
suited to answer your questions on that
 
04:40:00.788 --> 04:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
than I am mine would be the 100,000 foot
 
04:40:02.030 --> 04:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
View and they can certainly give you the
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
view before you do that could you send a
 
04:40:15.550 --> 04:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
corrected or what it's supposed to be to
 
04:40:20.910 --> 04:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
replace that graph we on 18 and 19 or it
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
shows you said it wasn't at 9.1 but it
 
04:40:25.320 --> 04:40:26.868 align:start position:0%
shows you said it wasn't at 9.1 but it
was

04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:40:29.470 --> 04:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
closer no so it that is actually
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
representing the amount that was
 
04:40:34.110 --> 04:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
budgeted we just budgeted it incorrectly
 
04:40:40.230 --> 04:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.240 --> 04:40:42.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:40:42.750 --> 04:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:42.760 --> 04:40:46.150 align:start position:0%
okay
go

04:40:46.150 --> 04:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
ahead all right I see Brooke and
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
Meredith have joined so if you want to
 
04:40:52.110 --> 04:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead and ask her question I think
 
04:40:54.190 --> 04:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
we'll be good you want me ask the
 
04:40:57.910 --> 04:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
question again yes oh this is Jim Murphy
 
04:41:00.510 --> 04:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um my question was it was more
 
04:41:02.550 --> 04:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
of a historical question as to where and
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
where we stand now regarding dish met
 
04:41:07.470 --> 04:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
payments I remember when this started 30
 
04:41:07.480 --> 04:41:08.470 align:start position:0%
payments I remember when this started 30
years

04:41:08.470 --> 04:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:41:12.750 --> 04:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
ago um it was meant to obviously help um
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
those hospitals that took care of a lot
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
of um uh charity care or Medicaid
 
04:41:18.868 --> 04:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
patients that weren't
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
paying the rate to for cost of the
 
04:41:24.510 --> 04:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
patient in the hospital and initially my
 
04:41:25.868 --> 04:41:25.878 align:start position:0%
understanding was
 
04:41:30.270 --> 04:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
that for every dollar say in met tax the
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
government or the state of New Hampshire
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
would receive another dollar from the
 
04:41:35.868 --> 04:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
fed and then that same dollar would go
 
04:41:38.310 --> 04:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
back to the hospitals so for about 10
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
years it was really a a zero sum game
 
04:41:42.510 --> 04:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
for hospitals but I think that has
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
slipped and I was just wondering if you
 
04:41:47.670 --> 04:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
have this information what percentage of
 
04:41:50.788 --> 04:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
met actually does return to hospitals
 
04:41:53.310 --> 04:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
for care of indigen patients and
 
04:41:53.320 --> 04:41:55.190 align:start position:0%
for care of indigen patients and
Medicaid

04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
04:41:57.708 --> 04:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
patients good afternoon representative
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh I'm Meredith tus with the Department
 
04:42:01.830 --> 04:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and happy
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
to answer your question you're quite
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
right in that historically that was the
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
mechanism the state used um and today we
 
04:42:13.708 --> 04:42:13.718 align:start position:0%
are operating the Met dish program under
 
04:42:16.110 --> 04:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
a settlement agreement with our
 
04:42:19.868 --> 04:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals um and according to that
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
settlement the hospitals in total not
 
04:42:27.190 --> 04:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
each Hospital specifically but in total
 
04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
in aggregate 26 hospitals not including
 
04:42:34.628 --> 04:42:34.638 align:start position:0%
the rehab hospitals receive back
 
04:42:37.788 --> 04:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
91% of the amount that they pay in
 
04:42:41.310 --> 04:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
met so as you noted the state receives
 
04:42:44.590 --> 04:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
the Met it is matched with federal
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
dollars and then they would receive back
 
04:42:52.590 --> 04:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
91% of the amount that they paid so to
 
04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
make it real simple um they would pay in
 
04:42:59.590 --> 04:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh $1
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
million thank you y absolutely
 
04:43:13.070 --> 04:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
you have a further question
 
04:43:13.080 --> 04:43:14.190 align:start position:0%
you have a further question
representative

04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
Murphy one of them was and I think it's
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
been somewhat of a contentious issue
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
among the 26 hospitals as to the uh
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
allocation of the Dish payment and I was
 
04:43:27.788 --> 04:43:27.798 align:start position:0%
wondering if that formula is is becoming
 
04:43:31.150 --> 04:43:31.160 align:start position:0%
more refined or changing going forward
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
um or is there any real change in the
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
monies or are you asking what's the
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
percentage difference between the less
 
04:43:45.788 --> 04:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
paid Hospital versus the highest paid or
 
04:43:50.590 --> 04:43:50.600 align:start position:0%
or simply trying to match the um the
 
04:43:53.470 --> 04:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
Dish payment to hospitals relative to
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
their um care of either Medicaid
 
04:43:58.550 --> 04:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
patients or charity care or no pay type
 
04:44:01.030 --> 04:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
patient so I was just wondering if there
 
04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
is any change in the way it's being
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
allocated going forward or is this the
 
04:44:04.480 --> 04:44:06.230 align:start position:0%
allocated going forward or is this the
same

04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:44:10.510 --> 04:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
formula H S the formula yes thank you
 
04:44:14.110 --> 04:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
for the question the the formula has
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
changed I'll say as the federal
 
04:44:17.280 --> 04:44:18.830 align:start position:0%
changed I'll say as the federal
definition

04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:44:22.788 --> 04:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
um changed however currently under our
 
04:44:26.830 --> 04:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement we have uh defined
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals the amount that they
 
04:44:32.708 --> 04:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
will receive back in met and so they
 
04:44:35.150 --> 04:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
receive that amount back that 91% I
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
referred to whether it's made as a Dish
 
04:44:41.070 --> 04:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
payment or another form of Medicaid pay
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
payment M so they will still receive
 
04:44:45.750 --> 04:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
back the same amount even if the
 
04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
definition of uncompensated care changes
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
which it has over the
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:59.990 --> 04:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:02.350 --> 04:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
questions Chris wasn't there another
 
04:45:06.628 --> 04:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
HHS there was a question related to the
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.270 --> 04:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.590 --> 04:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
up representa
 
04:45:26.350 --> 04:45:26.360 align:start position:0%
elmy thank you I actually had an
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
question related to the previous answer
 
04:45:31.150 --> 04:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
hi Meredith it's really good to hear you
 
04:45:34.350 --> 04:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
again anyway on you two
 
04:45:36.590 --> 04:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
representa we used
 
04:45:39.990 --> 04:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
to to give them back everything they'd
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
got and then use
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
they paid and then use the excess around
 
04:45:48.310 --> 04:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
until the feds told us we couldn't um
 
04:45:51.190 --> 04:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
use it around uh Medicaid and such and
 
04:45:57.470 --> 04:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
is the current 9% Surplus also put into
 
04:46:00.628 --> 04:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
General attempts to keep up our Medicaid
 
04:46:02.550 --> 04:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
obligations yes that's used in our
 
04:46:05.750 --> 04:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
account I think I better um give way to
 
04:46:12.190 --> 04:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
Edith before I asked my question about
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.030 --> 04:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
again so you're all through represent
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
Aly I have a second question but I
 
04:46:26.910 --> 04:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
thought representative Tucker had her
 
04:46:29.788 --> 04:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
hand up before I remembered nursing home
 
04:46:33.548 --> 04:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
I don't see her her hand up her hand is
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
up I can see
 
04:46:38.910 --> 04:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
it she's asking me to to to do the
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
question about nursing homes first
 
04:46:43.750 --> 04:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay but I think we got actually I
 
04:46:45.628 --> 04:46:45.638 align:start position:0%
remember now we got that
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
answered okay I see representative
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.750 --> 04:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:02.670 --> 04:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
unmute I'm going to ask a more amorphus
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
question up here in the North Country
 
04:47:08.830 --> 04:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
particularly we hear a lot uh from
 
04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
families and from
 
04:47:15.548 --> 04:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
communities from Selectmen about people
 
04:47:18.990 --> 04:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
who aren't being fully
 
04:47:23.390 --> 04:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
served and it's always hard to know
 
04:47:26.190 --> 04:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
trying to match the revenues and the
 
04:47:30.270 --> 04:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
needs how do we know as legislators or
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
how do we know as Goodwill citizens of
 
04:47:38.110 --> 04:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that our most vulnerable
 
04:47:41.150 --> 04:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
people are in fact being served that
 
04:47:42.750 --> 04:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
there is enough
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue I it's a huge agency with a
 
04:47:49.230 --> 04:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
tremendous number of
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so how how would if you
 
04:47:54.628 --> 04:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
were a legislator what would you look
 
04:47:59.708 --> 04:47:59.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
question I think that the best um place
 
04:48:05.868 --> 04:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
for those types of questions is really
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services oversight
 
04:48:09.990 --> 04:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee the commissioner regularly
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
attends that meeting
 
04:48:13.708 --> 04:48:13.718 align:start position:0%
um you know my perspective is mostly
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
from a finance perspective and not from
 
04:48:17.390 --> 04:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
a programmatic perspective where the
 
04:48:19.830 --> 04:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner um you know really has an
 
04:48:22.708 --> 04:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
overview of program and finance right to
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that question um so I
 
04:48:27.628 --> 04:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
I think that that committee is probably
 
04:48:30.548 --> 04:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
best for that type of question so how
 
04:48:33.390 --> 04:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
often does the oversight committee
 
04:48:35.548 --> 04:48:35.558 align:start position:0%
meet uh Chris I'm not sure if you
 
04:48:37.150 --> 04:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
remember but I want to say it's at least
 
04:48:40.030 --> 04:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
once a month it's on Fridays um and I
 
04:48:43.230 --> 04:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
don't remember the EXA time I I don't
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
careen remember exactly I know they meet
 
04:48:46.830 --> 04:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
I think it's monthly as correct but I
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
also think they meet as needed so there
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
may be times of the year where they do
 
04:48:54.030 --> 04:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
frequently I think the pandemic has
 
04:48:58.990 --> 04:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
taken its toll and people are very
 
04:49:01.948 --> 04:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
worried so thank you very much
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
understandably you're
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
welcome Karen
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
uh is there any reason
 
04:49:13.350 --> 04:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
why somebody from your department
 
04:49:15.948 --> 04:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't ask that question of
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
them and get that information for the
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
committee um we we certainly can do that
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
I just I I'm just concerned that it's
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
not the best
 
04:49:31.030 --> 04:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just concerned about the context
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
I I think that the oversight committee
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
is the better committee to discuss that
 
04:49:38.270 --> 04:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
but certainly uh if we um maybe if
 
04:49:39.470 --> 04:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker you don't mind
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
putting the question in writing I can uh
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
bring it to my commissioner and provide
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
questions do you have anything else uh
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner all I'm sorry I am I am
 
04:50:01.708 --> 04:50:01.718 align:start position:0%

talking a little fast through
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
presentations so uh I'm glad you got six
 
04:50:41.948 --> 04:50:41.958 align:start position:0%
minutes back but I hope that um I didn't
 
04:50:44.350 --> 04:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
confuse anyone so thank you
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
again you're
 
04:50:51.390 --> 04:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
welcome all right we will be back at two
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock could I ask you a question uh
 
04:50:57.868 --> 04:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
yes do you expect that we're going to be
 
04:51:01.190 --> 04:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
voting on any bills on
 
04:51:05.230 --> 04:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
Thursday it depends if we have any bills
 
04:51:09.548 --> 04:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
that uh it's clearcut that we're all in
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
agreement on
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes if uh if not we won't
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
be so they'll be divided into three
 
04:51:23.948 --> 04:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
areas the first area if it's clearcut
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
that we have an agreement on to either
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
itl or pass as is without any Amendment
 
04:51:33.150 --> 04:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
we'll do it and then pass but with an
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
amendment then we'll have to wait for
 
04:51:35.480 --> 04:51:36.310 align:start position:0%
amendment then we'll have to wait for
the

04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:38.350 --> 04:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
amendment the other
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
is is is it something that it's in it's
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
really we it's interesting but we don't
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
have enough information and we need more
 
04:51:54.270 --> 04:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
retain good and the other one the other
 
04:51:57.200 --> 04:51:58.030 align:start position:0%
retain good and the other one the other
one

04:51:58.030 --> 04:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
is if everybody agrees uh to itl fine or
 
04:52:05.708 --> 04:52:05.718 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and the other the last
 
04:52:07.430 --> 04:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
category is one
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
that we have part of the committee agre
 
04:52:13.310 --> 04:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
one way and P the committee agrees the
 
04:52:13.320 --> 04:52:14.150 align:start position:0%
one way and P the committee agrees the
other

04:52:14.150 --> 04:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:52:17.708 --> 04:52:17.718 align:start position:0%
way um it might be one we might want to
 
04:52:20.670 --> 04:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
handle as a committee as a whole before
 
04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
we make a decision one way or the other
 
04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
so it's up to the the people that do the
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
presenting to convince everybody to to
 
04:52:36.628 --> 04:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
go for it or or their presentation says
 
04:52:39.110 --> 04:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
hey everybody wants to kill this
 
04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
or all right
 
04:52:43.628 --> 04:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:49.230 --> 04:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and then there'll be those that um
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
let's say there's different opinions on
 
04:52:56.190 --> 04:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
both sides we won't exact that right
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
away we give an opportunity for the
 
04:53:02.430 --> 04:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
caucuses to be able to meet and discuss
 
04:53:04.708 --> 04:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
and then maybe we might be able to work
 
04:53:07.628 --> 04:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
something out between the
 
04:53:10.750 --> 04:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
caucuses okay thank you very much are
 
04:53:10.760 --> 04:53:12.110 align:start position:0%
caucuses okay thank you very much are
general

04:53:12.110 --> 04:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
general
 
04:53:12.120 --> 04:53:15.230 align:start position:0%
general
questions

04:53:15.230 --> 04:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
um looks like a good amount of people on
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
Thursday will be doing it virtually
 
04:53:24.628 --> 04:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
which which I feel is probably
 
04:53:29.868 --> 04:53:29.878 align:start position:0%
better and those that will be appearing
 
04:53:33.430 --> 04:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet in room 206 208
 
04:53:35.788 --> 04:53:35.798 align:start position:0%
it'll be combined into one
 
04:53:38.708 --> 04:53:38.718 align:start position:0%
room on Thursday those
 
04:53:41.390 --> 04:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
that decide that they want to
 
04:53:45.030 --> 04:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:48.628 --> 04:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
person tomorrow will be similar to today
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:57.150 --> 04:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
shorter see we got five
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
here Mr Glennon is here just so you
 
04:54:14.190 --> 04:54:14.200 align:start position:0%

04:54:17.270 --> 04:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
of Securities Bureau just okay you be
 
04:54:20.910 --> 04:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
aware of that that's all okay okay so
 
04:54:22.750 --> 04:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we're going to hit from the
 
04:54:25.190 --> 04:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
insurance department at
 
04:54:29.470 --> 04:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
9 from from the Department of Safety at
 
04:54:32.910 --> 04:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
10: Department of Transportation at
 
04:54:36.350 --> 04:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
11: fishing game at
 
04:54:38.830 --> 04:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
11:30 then at one o'clock the department
 
04:54:40.948 --> 04:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
of administrative services
 
04:54:44.910 --> 04:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:48.470 --> 04:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
Department after we get through with the
 
04:54:52.350 --> 04:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
agency head for this turn around then
 
04:54:54.868 --> 04:54:54.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to start getting into the
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
work the meat of our work and go into
 
04:55:01.310 --> 04:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
work sessions and then go through these
 
04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
revenue streams one by
 
04:55:06.948 --> 04:55:06.958 align:start position:0%
one and what I'm
 
04:55:09.390 --> 04:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
anticipating and I hope it happens that
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
way is is that
 
04:55:14.548 --> 04:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
everybody the new as well as those that
 
04:55:17.510 --> 04:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
have been on the committee for a while
 
04:55:20.470 --> 04:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
participate because as we go
 
04:55:23.948 --> 04:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
through looking at each of these
 
04:55:27.670 --> 04:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
revenues we'll end up wanting to know
 
04:55:30.390 --> 04:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
what is your opinion on this particular
 
04:55:32.110 --> 04:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue what do you think the range will
 
04:55:34.590 --> 04:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
be so everybody should be able to
 
04:55:36.990 --> 04:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
contribute what they think their range
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
is is going to be based upon everything
 
04:55:42.830 --> 04:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
that they've heard from the economists
 
04:55:46.628 --> 04:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
and from the agency heads or wherever
 
04:55:52.190 --> 04:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
else and that way uh we get the most
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
broadest amount of information to
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
consider uh it seemed to have worked in
 
04:56:00.708 --> 04:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
the past and then we'll look at the
 
04:56:02.670 --> 04:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
ranges and make a decision of how we
 
04:56:06.310 --> 04:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
want to come up with the final
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
decision but you want to be prepared to
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
defend why you think it's going to go
 
04:56:16.110 --> 04:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
this high or that
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
low so don't think you're going to be
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
just a member of the committee to listen
 
04:56:25.910 --> 04:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
you want you want to listen but you you
 
04:56:28.030 --> 04:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
want to make a contribution to it too
 
04:56:29.430 --> 04:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's the only way you really get to
 
04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
learn because it forces you to ask the
 
04:56:37.910 --> 04:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:40.510 --> 04:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
question have two more minutes any
 
04:56:40.520 --> 04:56:43.948 align:start position:0%

04:56:59.948 --> 04:56:59.958 align:start position:0%

you too oh you
 
04:59:10.830 --> 04:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
great progress
 
04:59:12.510 --> 04:59:12.520 align:start position:0%
I'm literally just right over here at
 
04:59:15.510 --> 04:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
the uh Annex Building um but it seems
 
04:59:17.390 --> 04:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
like we're tens of miles away when it
 
04:59:19.830 --> 04:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
comes to uh technology so I'm glad we
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
came through I wasn't so successful with
 
04:59:24.548 --> 04:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
uh the Commerce Committee uh last week
 
04:59:26.830 --> 04:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm really excited at this point they
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're all new at this so yes yes that
 
04:59:31.750 --> 04:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
was reminded of that by representative
 
04:59:35.070 --> 04:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
hunt um he was very forgiving well thank
 
04:59:38.750 --> 04:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
you uh very much um Mr chair uh for in
 
04:59:41.470 --> 04:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
inviting me uh to uh present this
 
04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon regarding Bureau of Security's
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh Revenue um and projected Revenue um
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
you know well into uh
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
2023 uh I thought it might be helpful
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
for some of the newer members um Mr
 
04:59:58.628 --> 04:59:58.638 align:start position:0%
chair uh who may not necessarily be
 
05:00:00.190 --> 05:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
acquainted with the bureau just to give
 
05:00:03.628 --> 05:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
a very very brief um 50 slide
 
05:00:05.310 --> 05:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
presentation on the bureau I'm just
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
kidding just a very brief presentation
 
05:00:10.190 --> 05:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
about uh the bureau and then I think
 
05:00:13.070 --> 05:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
that'll help put in proper context uh
 
05:00:16.270 --> 05:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
the uh Revenue sources uh that we have
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
um and then certainly uh answer any
 
05:00:22.190 --> 05:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee may have um
 
05:00:25.390 --> 05:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
if if I may I'd like to uh share uh the
 
05:00:28.390 --> 05:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
screen here to just kick off I believe
 
05:00:31.430 --> 05:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
that uh uh Christopher also has provided
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
and uploaded these um to uh to the
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh so they could be uh viewed
 
05:00:40.470 --> 05:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
online uh or shared on online let me
 
05:00:45.310 --> 05:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
just expand this out and uh I'll be with
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
you just one second here we go you're
 
05:00:50.510 --> 05:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
seeing that now in full screen hey
 
05:00:53.590 --> 05:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
you're better at this than some others
 
05:00:55.708 --> 05:00:55.718 align:start position:0%
all right well you're able to put it on
 
05:00:58.628 --> 05:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
and then expand it all right very little
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
practice here my wife actually did a
 
05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
tutorial with me yesterday she's a
 
05:01:06.190 --> 05:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
teacher she's teaching remote well
 
05:01:09.390 --> 05:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
partly well um the Bureau of Securities
 
05:01:12.230 --> 05:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
regulation is organized under uh the
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office I report to
 
05:01:15.548 --> 05:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
to secretary
 
05:01:19.110 --> 05:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
Gardner responsible for the uh
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory oversight of broker dealers
 
05:01:24.750 --> 05:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
investment advisors uh as well as the
 
05:01:27.390 --> 05:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
registration of Securities that are sold
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh our major functions again
 
05:01:34.788 --> 05:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
very quickly are licensing of of these
 
05:01:36.868 --> 05:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
entities uh the registration of
 
05:01:39.190 --> 05:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
Securities we're also responsible for
 
05:01:42.310 --> 05:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
conducting uh unannounced in-person
 
05:01:45.548 --> 05:01:45.558 align:start position:0%
exams of the branch offices of these
 
05:01:48.510 --> 05:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
firms uh throughout the state we also
 
05:01:51.030 --> 05:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
have an investor education uh function
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
which is written right into the statute
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
where we go out and and meet with
 
05:01:57.270 --> 05:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
members of the public and also on radio
 
05:02:00.030 --> 05:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
or television to help promote investor
 
05:02:03.270 --> 05:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
protection and investor safety uh and
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
then perhaps our most important role is
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh the enforcement component that is
 
05:02:10.708 --> 05:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
enforcing ours
 
05:02:13.470 --> 05:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
421b um and it is really through the
 
05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement that is really one of the
 
05:02:17.190 --> 05:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
one of our sources of revenue it's not
 
05:02:19.470 --> 05:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
general fund Revenue however we are a
 
05:02:23.430 --> 05:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency um with a staff of 12
 
05:02:26.510 --> 05:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
so we do rely upon finds and penalties
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
that are derived from enforcement
 
05:02:31.708 --> 05:02:31.718 align:start position:0%
actions uh to uh fund our
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
operation uh in terms of our overall
 
05:02:37.070 --> 05:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
volume of activity uh we have there
 
05:02:40.150 --> 05:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 1,200 uh licensed broker
 
05:02:42.270 --> 05:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
dealers that we oversee more
 
05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
surprisingly uh over 118,000 registered
 
05:02:47.830 --> 05:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives licensed to do business
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and just as a point of
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
clarification they're not all residents
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that would be
 
05:02:55.910 --> 05:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
about the population of Manchester but
 
05:02:58.708 --> 05:02:58.718 align:start position:0%
they are uh licensed to solicit into the
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire which which is
 
05:03:03.230 --> 05:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
what triggers the license and very some
 
05:03:06.430 --> 05:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
very some somehow your voice drops to
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
almost nothing oh comes back up
 
05:03:12.150 --> 05:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay maybe I'll I'll try to to speak a
 
05:03:16.628 --> 05:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
little bit louder okay okay um and then
 
05:03:18.590 --> 05:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of investment advisors as you
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
can see roughly 2,300 investment
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
advisors uh and of course they're agent
 
05:03:26.670 --> 05:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives they perform a slightly
 
05:03:29.270 --> 05:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
different function than broker dealers
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
um uh which I can explain but perhaps u
 
05:03:35.070 --> 05:03:35.080 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time uh we'll jump
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
into some of the more salian parts um in
 
05:03:40.830 --> 05:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
terms of our audits uh they're very
 
05:03:44.670 --> 05:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
thorough uh we do only charge $100 per
 
05:03:48.510 --> 05:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
uh per day per examination of firms uh
 
05:03:51.230 --> 05:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
however um it's it's fair and reasonable
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
in relation to other states uh but we do
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
have a two full-time Auditors out there
 
05:03:59.948 --> 05:03:59.958 align:start position:0%
during pandemic we've had to Resort more
 
05:04:03.670 --> 05:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
towards uh desk audits uh simply because
 
05:04:05.788 --> 05:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
uh the firms have been uh hesitant to
 
05:04:07.670 --> 05:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
have anyone inside and then many of them
 
05:04:10.868 --> 05:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
are actually working remotely
 
05:04:13.590 --> 05:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh enforcement is as I said is is a
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
significant source of uh revenue for
 
05:04:18.868 --> 05:04:18.878 align:start position:0%
operating the bureau uh but also the
 
05:04:21.230 --> 05:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
most active component with you know at
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
least 70 complaints and 40 enforcement
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
actions annually uh we also have
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
administrative hearings at a hearings
 
05:04:32.030 --> 05:04:32.040 align:start position:0%
officer uh and then um we're also a
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
source of information for the public in
 
05:04:35.670 --> 05:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of questions they may have
 
05:04:39.750 --> 05:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
about maybe lost uh stock certificates
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
or uh just general questions about their
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
Investments so we perform that more
 
05:04:46.670 --> 05:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
significantly though and I think the
 
05:04:50.030 --> 05:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
purpose uh uh Mr chair of course of our
 
05:04:53.430 --> 05:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
meeting today is to talk about uh securi
 
05:04:56.070 --> 05:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and as you would had asked
 
05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
the five-year uh summary of Revenue as
 
05:05:01.150 --> 05:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
you can see from the chart here there
 
05:05:04.110 --> 05:05:04.120 align:start position:0%
really there are two primary uh buckets
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
of of of Revenue first is broker dealer
 
05:05:09.750 --> 05:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
investment broker dealer and investment
 
05:05:12.670 --> 05:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
adviser fees and the second being
 
05:05:14.470 --> 05:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
Securities registrations now I can
 
05:05:17.548 --> 05:05:17.558 align:start position:0%
certainly explain both uh broker dealers
 
05:05:19.150 --> 05:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
and investment advisor fees those are
 
05:05:21.030 --> 05:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
the firms that do business in the state
 
05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
as well as the
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
118,000 agent Representatives so we
 
05:05:27.430 --> 05:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
derive a fair amount of revenue from
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
that Source uh as you can see in uh 2020
 
05:05:34.750 --> 05:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
uh it was 16.6 million um over the
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
course of five years it has uh increased
 
05:05:40.270 --> 05:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
significantly uh I would attribute that
 
05:05:42.470 --> 05:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh growth over that period really due to
 
05:05:46.390 --> 05:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
a booming uh economy as well as uh just
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
overall Investments as people may have
 
05:05:51.430 --> 05:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
seen in their own 401ks and Iris uh
 
05:05:53.310 --> 05:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
there's been significant growth with
 
05:05:55.990 --> 05:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
regard to broker dealers and their
 
05:05:58.430 --> 05:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
representatives uh same for uh
 
05:05:58.440 --> 05:05:59.548 align:start position:0%
representatives uh same for uh
investment

05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
investment
 
05:06:01.948 --> 05:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
advisers however on the Securities
 
05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
registration side as you can see there's
 
05:06:06.430 --> 05:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
been a bit of a fluctuation over the
 
05:06:10.510 --> 05:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
past 5 Years From 2016 to 2020 ranging
 
05:06:13.070 --> 05:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 24 to $29
 
05:06:17.110 --> 05:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
million uh this is largely due to Market
 
05:06:20.190 --> 05:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
fluctuations uh and the offering of
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
private Securities products uh it's
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
really part of the whole Capital
 
05:06:26.910 --> 05:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
formation activity where companies are
 
05:06:29.270 --> 05:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
going out uh to raise money or they're
 
05:06:32.190 --> 05:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
not raising money uh or there's uh been
 
05:06:35.548 --> 05:06:35.558 align:start position:0%
an expansion in terms of entrepreneurs
 
05:06:37.590 --> 05:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh seeking to raise Capital whenever
 
05:06:39.310 --> 05:06:39.320 align:start position:0%
they do that they have they're making a
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
public public offering they have to
 
05:06:42.830 --> 05:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
actually file with the state the
 
05:06:44.430 --> 05:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
offering that that they intend to
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
solicit and sell in state so that has
 
05:06:50.190 --> 05:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
varied also mutual funds are a component
 
05:06:52.590 --> 05:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
a significant component I might add in
 
05:06:55.350 --> 05:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
terms of Securities registrations uh we
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
have well over 22,000 mutual funds that
 
05:07:00.510 --> 05:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
are registered in New Hampshire which is
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
not unusual with uh in comparison to
 
05:07:04.830 --> 05:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
other states because most funds will
 
05:07:08.110 --> 05:07:08.120 align:start position:0%
offer in all 50 states uh that number
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
does vary and I do see a slight decrease
 
05:07:13.868 --> 05:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
uh coming into uh
 
05:07:16.190 --> 05:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
2022 uh for that
 
05:07:19.470 --> 05:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
reason uh also there have been changes
 
05:07:21.548 --> 05:07:21.558 align:start position:0%
on the federal level with regard to
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
mutual funds uh it's known as the
 
05:07:26.548 --> 05:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
regulation bi best interests and what
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
that is is that um any kind of let's say
 
05:07:32.390 --> 05:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
401K plans whenever they offer mutual
 
05:07:35.310 --> 05:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
funds within the plan itself the rule
 
05:07:38.548 --> 05:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
now is that you have to Pro provide
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
products that are in the best interest
 
05:07:43.708 --> 05:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
of the customer and oftentimes best
 
05:07:46.670 --> 05:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
interest means the lowest rate uh fund
 
05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
lowest cost fund and so we've seen a bit
 
05:07:51.190 --> 05:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
of a contraction in the mutual fund
 
05:07:53.190 --> 05:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
industry where they've eliminated some
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
of the higher fee mutual funds and going
 
05:07:58.708 --> 05:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
with more of the reduced fee you know 50
 
05:08:02.708 --> 05:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
basis points 100 basis point type funds
 
05:08:05.230 --> 05:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
so there's been a slight reduction in
 
05:08:07.670 --> 05:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
mutual fund filings but it does
 
05:08:10.990 --> 05:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
fluctuate as I said and I do anticipate
 
05:08:13.830 --> 05:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh recovery and Co has been a factor as
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
well with with certainly with the
 
05:08:17.430 --> 05:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
overall Securities
 
05:08:20.590 --> 05:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
filings uh and I I'm hopeful for a
 
05:08:22.830 --> 05:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
recovery I'm actually most certain of of
 
05:08:24.948 --> 05:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
that that it'll occur in each of these
 
05:08:24.958 --> 05:08:25.948 align:start position:0%
that that it'll occur in each of these
two

05:08:25.948 --> 05:08:25.958 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:08:27.788 --> 05:08:27.798 align:start position:0%
categories um as far as the
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
certification fees um that you can see
 
05:08:32.868 --> 05:08:32.878 align:start position:0%
in the column that was eliminated by the
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
legislature was rule they were called
 
05:08:37.868 --> 05:08:37.878 align:start position:0%
Rule 506 offerings uh Securities
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
offerings uh renewal Fe fees were
 
05:08:42.670 --> 05:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
charged that was eliminated by uh the
 
05:08:45.470 --> 05:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
legislature um back
 
05:08:51.470 --> 05:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
in six 18 I believe six no 17 uh and
 
05:08:53.190 --> 05:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
then Bell bondsman there's been a steady
 
05:08:54.868 --> 05:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
decrease in that which is a really small
 
05:08:56.868 --> 05:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue we do regulate bail
 
05:08:59.750 --> 05:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
bondsmen uh however with bail reform a
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
number of The Bondsmen have actually
 
05:09:02.708 --> 05:09:02.718 align:start position:0%
left the industry and I think we're only
 
05:09:05.670 --> 05:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
down to two bail bondsman uh throughout
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
the state which is unfortunate but that
 
05:09:10.868 --> 05:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
has been you know a result of Court
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
reform and and changes in in bail
 
05:09:17.150 --> 05:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
statutes so as far as overall projected
 
05:09:20.670 --> 05:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
Revenue as as you can see um I uh
 
05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate that uh we will uh end 2021
 
05:09:28.030 --> 05:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
at approximately 41.
 
05:09:31.750 --> 05:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh250 uh million do uh and then an
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
increase over uh the next two years uh
 
05:09:37.230 --> 05:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
as we see more broker dealers coming
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
back postco uh opening more Branch
 
05:09:43.350 --> 05:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
offices registering more uh registered
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
representatives and investment advisors
 
05:09:48.390 --> 05:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh so that contraction I I I believe is
 
05:09:51.868 --> 05:09:51.878 align:start position:0%
just temporary due to people registered
 
05:09:55.070 --> 05:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives leaving the industry uh
 
05:09:56.990 --> 05:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe working from home and deciding
 
05:09:59.470 --> 05:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
it's really not working and leaving not
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
re-registering uh but returning so the
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
picture uh does look look better uh as
 
05:10:09.548 --> 05:10:09.558 align:start position:0%
we go forward um and I believe that that
 
05:10:13.788 --> 05:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair is essentially uh uh uh a
 
05:10:16.750 --> 05:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
review of what we see for Revenue uh
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
coming forward this year as well as the
 
05:10:20.830 --> 05:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
next two fiscal years and I'd be happy
 
05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Barry for your
 
05:10:31.390 --> 05:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
presentation and we have questions from
 
05:10:31.400 --> 05:10:33.070 align:start position:0%
presentation and we have questions from
the

05:10:33.070 --> 05:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:38.230 --> 05:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:38.240 --> 05:10:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
Ames

05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
05:10:43.390 --> 05:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
you'll have to unmute D I've got it um
 
05:10:46.270 --> 05:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that good presentation
 
05:10:49.628 --> 05:10:49.638 align:start position:0%
um so my question is about enforcement
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
actions and uh you mentioned those are
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
significant I I assume a significant
 
05:10:59.470 --> 05:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
activity in your department or agency
 
05:11:02.190 --> 05:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
and um I wondered if you could provide
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
us with an example or two of sort of the
 
05:11:07.628 --> 05:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
major kinds of enforcement actions that
 
05:11:09.390 --> 05:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
you'd be engaged in and what kind
 
05:11:12.430 --> 05:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
money's involved certainly they they
 
05:11:16.110 --> 05:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
really do range um uh in in terms of the
 
05:11:18.430 --> 05:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
types of cases that we typically see
 
05:11:20.110 --> 05:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
it's really the sale of products that
 
05:11:22.628 --> 05:11:22.638 align:start position:0%
are not suitable for the particular
 
05:11:25.030 --> 05:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
investor um there are sometimes where
 
05:11:27.670 --> 05:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
agents agent Representatives May engage
 
05:11:30.110 --> 05:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
in activity that is not appropriate in
 
05:11:32.628 --> 05:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
other words they may do what we call
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
churning where they're overtrading the
 
05:11:37.310 --> 05:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
account they're constantly uh selling
 
05:11:40.750 --> 05:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
mutual fund or or proposing one for the
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
purchase and then the sale of it in a
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
very short time period and then then
 
05:11:47.230 --> 05:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
recommending another another product and
 
05:11:48.430 --> 05:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
again they get a commission each and
 
05:11:50.230 --> 05:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
every time they do that that's called
 
05:11:54.470 --> 05:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
churning and um it's it's uh not allowed
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's really not a suitable sales
 
05:11:58.948 --> 05:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
practice whatsoever um there's also
 
05:12:01.990 --> 05:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
fraud that occurs licensed individuals
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
but more so that we see those who are
 
05:12:06.030 --> 05:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
not licensed they may have been in the
 
05:12:08.110 --> 05:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
industry at one point uh they left the
 
05:12:09.990 --> 05:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
industry however they never bothered to
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
tell their clients that or or they sell
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
products that are very
 
05:12:17.470 --> 05:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
speculative over the internet again on
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
an unlicensed
 
05:12:22.110 --> 05:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
basis and uh ultimately results in you
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
know significant losses and in terms of
 
05:12:27.390 --> 05:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
the victims that that we see uh they can
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
really vary um it could be uh an elderly
 
05:12:34.310 --> 05:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
couple um that has uh maybe
 
05:12:36.990 --> 05:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 let's say in their overall
 
05:12:39.910 --> 05:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
savings uh that was uh squandered and
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
and swindled Away by someone some
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous uh person uh and then we
 
05:12:47.230 --> 05:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
have at the opposite end of the range
 
05:12:49.868 --> 05:12:49.878 align:start position:0%
some that are relatively wealthy
 
05:12:54.070 --> 05:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
individuals um who are likewise often
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes not always taken
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
advantage of I think probably the most
 
05:13:01.190 --> 05:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh interesting case that we've had this
 
05:13:03.830 --> 05:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
year this fiscal year actually involved
 
05:13:05.990 --> 05:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh former former uh New Hampshire
 
05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
Governor uh Craig Benson where um he
 
05:13:12.030 --> 05:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
experienced difficulty with uh his
 
05:13:14.510 --> 05:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
brokerage firm and that resulted in the
 
05:13:15.830 --> 05:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
return of well
 
05:13:18.910 --> 05:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
over I think it was maybe 22 million
 
05:13:22.150 --> 05:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
back to uh uh to the governor who was a
 
05:13:24.510 --> 05:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
victim in in this case so it really does
 
05:13:28.750 --> 05:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
range we I mean uh uh not to boast but
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud of of what the bureau
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
does and I can just tell you
 
05:13:35.548 --> 05:13:35.558 align:start position:0%
representative that that we make sure
 
05:13:37.230 --> 05:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
that the same attention is afforded to
 
05:13:39.548 --> 05:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
the individual that lost Maybe we might
 
05:13:42.628 --> 05:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
consider a small sum as a in even the
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
larger uh losses as well we treat them
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
equally uh because it represents their
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
assets it represents their livelihood
 
05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
and their retirement many of many cases
 
05:13:52.600 --> 05:13:53.910 align:start position:0%
and their retirement many of many cases
their

05:13:53.910 --> 05:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
retirement thank you so much that's very
 
05:13:58.030 --> 05:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
helpful to have a picture of what you're
 
05:14:02.470 --> 05:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
doing thank you representative
 
05:14:03.860 --> 05:14:03.870 align:start position:0%
Mary a
 
05:14:03.870 --> 05:14:07.510 align:start position:0%
Mary a
[Music]

05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:10.070 --> 05:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
can thank you Mr here it's um
 
05:14:11.910 --> 05:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative Mary hecken Phillips here
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering um let's see
 
05:14:17.548 --> 05:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
Barry I remember you said at the outside
 
05:14:20.190 --> 05:14:20.200 align:start position:0%
of your presentation that there were two
 
05:14:22.708 --> 05:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
Auditors maybe you could give the uh
 
05:14:25.708 --> 05:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
committee a sense of how many um staff
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
members are within the bureau and then
 
05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
how many of those staff members are for
 
05:14:33.750 --> 05:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh designated for enforcement purposes
 
05:14:36.788 --> 05:14:36.798 align:start position:0%
sure we have uh we have two full-time
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
Auditors actually first start we have a
 
05:14:40.470 --> 05:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
staff of 12 and that starts from the
 
05:14:44.430 --> 05:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
receptions to me um so there are two
 
05:14:47.230 --> 05:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
Auditors and then we also have five
 
05:14:49.990 --> 05:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
staff attorneys who are assigned to uh
 
05:14:52.230 --> 05:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
the enforcement unit uh because and
 
05:14:54.510 --> 05:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
their attorneys because uh we are
 
05:14:56.470 --> 05:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with you know essentially
 
05:14:58.390 --> 05:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
lawyers when we file an action against
 
05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
broker dealer firm uh more often than
 
05:15:03.310 --> 05:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
not they're hiring some of the big guns
 
05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
as I might call call them some of the
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
larger firms even you know local firms
 
05:15:11.788 --> 05:15:11.798 align:start position:0%
firms International firms that represent
 
05:15:13.948 --> 05:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
some of these uh larger broker dealers
 
05:15:17.310 --> 05:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
and investment advisors so it the
 
05:15:19.390 --> 05:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
process has evolved over the years
 
05:15:23.628 --> 05:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
certainly uh far more litigious uh in
 
05:15:26.350 --> 05:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
terms of their defense of their clients
 
05:15:28.628 --> 05:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
uh so we really do need to have you know
 
05:15:32.070 --> 05:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
trained and seasoned lawyers uh to uh
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
address these uh
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
cases if I could just ask a quick
 
05:15:39.070 --> 05:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
followup with that um what is the
 
05:15:41.868 --> 05:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
coordination on the federal level from
 
05:15:43.310 --> 05:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
the state you know in terms of
 
05:15:44.548 --> 05:15:44.558 align:start position:0%
proceeding with these enforcement
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
actions what kind of yes um actually
 
05:15:49.628 --> 05:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
it's a very very good question and I I I
 
05:15:51.470 --> 05:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
hope hopefully I won't confuse uh the
 
05:15:53.548 --> 05:15:53.558 align:start position:0%
committee on this but there are really
 
05:15:55.590 --> 05:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
three levels in terms of Securities
 
05:15:57.788 --> 05:15:57.798 align:start position:0%
regulation in the US we're all
 
05:16:00.788 --> 05:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
acquainted with the SEC uh the SEC is
 
05:16:02.548 --> 05:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
essentially the overall federal
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
government overseer of the markets uh
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
and of those who sell products uh
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the country so the SEC is
 
05:16:14.230 --> 05:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
primarily focused on the large public
 
05:16:17.310 --> 05:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
companies their public filings uh as
 
05:16:19.990 --> 05:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
well as some of the major cases they
 
05:16:22.110 --> 05:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
very rarely and I say I should really
 
05:16:23.788 --> 05:16:23.798 align:start position:0%
kind of couch my remarks I don't want to
 
05:16:26.230 --> 05:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
overstep here but they they rarely do
 
05:16:28.110 --> 05:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
not engage with some of the smaller
 
05:16:29.948 --> 05:16:29.958 align:start position:0%
investors on the state level they
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
relegate that really to the indiv 50
 
05:16:35.110 --> 05:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
state Regulators so we tend to take more
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
of the local type actions um where that
 
05:16:41.150 --> 05:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
involved New Hampshire investors the
 
05:16:43.868 --> 05:16:43.878 align:start position:0%
intermediary is called finra uh which is
 
05:16:46.430 --> 05:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
a self-regulatory organization that
 
05:16:49.310 --> 05:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
broke a dealers must belong to it's a
 
05:16:51.990 --> 05:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
member based organization uh it's really
 
05:16:54.030 --> 05:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a subset of the SEC they're
 
05:16:57.390 --> 05:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
overseen by the SEC uh but they're
 
05:16:59.350 --> 05:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
they're a bit of an intermediary but
 
05:17:02.150 --> 05:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're not a state or federal regulator
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh more of a private regulatory
 
05:17:06.670 --> 05:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
organization that it's it's a bit
 
05:17:08.910 --> 05:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
different uh but it does exist so
 
05:17:10.948 --> 05:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
there's really three levels of of
 
05:17:13.990 --> 05:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
Regulation now the Bureau of Securities
 
05:17:15.390 --> 05:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
is a member of the North American
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
Securities administrators I'm the voting
 
05:17:19.230 --> 05:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
member and member of a chair of one of
 
05:17:22.590 --> 05:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
their committees and we as a as an
 
05:17:26.190 --> 05:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
organization will act uh in many cases
 
05:17:28.990 --> 05:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh on a global basis we will uh look at
 
05:17:31.830 --> 05:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
firms on a na Nationwide scale and
 
05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
coordinate our efforts uh when examining
 
05:17:37.070 --> 05:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
a particular firm or taking an
 
05:17:40.230 --> 05:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement action against firm uh and
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
that's how there's also various other
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
functions common training you know when
 
05:17:47.548 --> 05:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
we can uh travel a lot of it is done by
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
way of Zoom nowadays but we do
 
05:17:52.990 --> 05:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
participate nationally uh in that regard
 
05:17:54.868 --> 05:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
uh and of course the New England
 
05:17:57.708 --> 05:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
Regulators we have our own group uh and
 
05:17:59.470 --> 05:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
we coordinate our actions because we're
 
05:18:02.270 --> 05:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
such in in New England we're so close to
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
each other it's really important that we
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
talk to each other because often times
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh there are Bad actors that are
 
05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
crossing state into into Maine into
 
05:18:13.270 --> 05:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
Vermont into Mass to Rhode Island
 
05:18:18.628 --> 05:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:20.750 --> 05:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
respect are you all
 
05:18:26.590 --> 05:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
set representing Phillips okay
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
next is represent
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
Alan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:18:35.628 --> 05:18:35.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Mr Gleason I have
 
05:18:38.350 --> 05:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
two questions one is the document that's
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
up on your screen
 
05:18:43.948 --> 05:18:43.958 align:start position:0%
share in the middle of it you show um
 
05:18:43.958 --> 05:18:45.270 align:start position:0%
share in the middle of it you show um
year-to-date

05:18:45.270 --> 05:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
year-to-date
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
actuals and the year is 50% over and the
 
05:18:52.310 --> 05:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
revenue is just over 10% what was
 
05:18:55.708 --> 05:18:55.718 align:start position:0%
projected is that typical is everything
 
05:18:57.150 --> 05:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
that waited to the third and fourth
 
05:19:00.470 --> 05:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
quarter of the fiscal year it is uh the
 
05:19:02.110 --> 05:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh fourth quarter and then well first
 
05:19:03.628 --> 05:19:03.638 align:start position:0%
and fourth quarter and and
 
05:19:06.310 --> 05:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative it's a very good point as
 
05:19:09.310 --> 05:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
you can see 2021 only showing
 
05:19:12.390 --> 05:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh 2.2 million thus far however this
 
05:19:14.510 --> 05:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
this this revenue is reflected through
 
05:19:14.520 --> 05:19:15.430 align:start position:0%
this this revenue is reflected through
December

05:19:15.430 --> 05:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
December
 
05:19:18.590 --> 05:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
31 it does not reflect January revenue
 
05:19:22.070 --> 05:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
we will see an enormous infusion uh in
 
05:19:24.750 --> 05:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
January as you can see just on the
 
05:19:26.750 --> 05:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
broker dealer side they all Renew on
 
05:19:28.990 --> 05:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
January one of each year so we will
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
easily see uh somewhere around $13
 
05:19:34.948 --> 05:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
million alone just with broker dealers
 
05:19:37.628 --> 05:19:37.638 align:start position:0%
that will flow that will be reflected uh
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
in January
 
05:19:42.030 --> 05:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
and then Securities registrations which
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
right now are showing only 252,000
 
05:19:51.548 --> 05:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
we will see at least um 22 million flow
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
in from Mutual Funds uh during the month
 
05:19:57.670 --> 05:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
of March and April uh of this year so
 
05:20:00.030 --> 05:20:00.040 align:start position:0%
that's uh that it doesn't give you a
 
05:20:02.670 --> 05:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
complete picture actually as far as what
 
05:20:06.190 --> 05:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
we will see come May uh so there are two
 
05:20:10.190 --> 05:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
big Revenue um increases is in January
 
05:20:11.910 --> 05:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
and April
 
05:20:15.310 --> 05:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
May thank you that answer very
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
comforting yes comforting to me
 
05:20:21.628 --> 05:20:21.638 align:start position:0%
too uh and Mr chair I have a second
 
05:20:24.670 --> 05:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
question with your permission go ahead
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned that uh some of the
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
revenue is derived from Mutual Funds
 
05:20:32.190 --> 05:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
being operate in retirement plans yes
 
05:20:34.510 --> 05:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
and just as as a Layman it it seems like
 
05:20:36.470 --> 05:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of migration going on
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
right now from mutual funds to
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
ETFs it is is that perception correct
 
05:20:45.788 --> 05:20:45.798 align:start position:0%
and will that affect Revenue going
 
05:20:48.548 --> 05:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
forward do we collect the same amount of
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
is there some type of fee associated
 
05:20:51.830 --> 05:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
with an
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
ETF that corresponds to yes we we do uh
 
05:20:59.230 --> 05:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
we do collect on uh ETF type
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
filings um the it's been a gradual
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
progression uh towards uh exchange
 
05:21:08.750 --> 05:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
traded funds and just for for the
 
05:21:11.070 --> 05:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
ification of of the committee uh
 
05:21:13.830 --> 05:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
exchange traded funds the price itself
 
05:21:17.788 --> 05:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
per share uh or the net asset value can
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
change from minute to minute based upon
 
05:21:22.910 --> 05:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
the trading activity unlike a mutual
 
05:21:25.948 --> 05:21:25.958 align:start position:0%
fund where the value of the share is set
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
at the concl at the conclusion of the
 
05:21:31.788 --> 05:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
trading day so ETFs are more it's really
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
a collection of stocks that exist within
 
05:21:36.270 --> 05:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
the fund but that they can be rapidly
 
05:21:38.110 --> 05:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
traded throughout the day and they can
 
05:21:42.670 --> 05:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
fluctuate value so um some ETFs have
 
05:21:44.470 --> 05:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
been performing really quite well
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
they're very popular um and I I can't
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
say anything really negative about them
 
05:21:52.510 --> 05:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
um uh other than the fact that there is
 
05:21:54.868 --> 05:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
a an additional risk when you do
 
05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
purchase them because the value can
 
05:22:00.270 --> 05:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
fluctuate okay thank you for your
 
05:22:03.150 --> 05:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
response I appreciate it uh do we have
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:07.520 --> 05:22:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
questions

05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
we don't there's no more hands raised
 
05:22:16.750 --> 05:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
so Barry we thank you for your
 
05:22:19.628 --> 05:22:19.638 align:start position:0%
presentation give us a lot to chew on
 
05:22:22.230 --> 05:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%

and which we definitely will have
 
05:23:14.510 --> 05:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
one maybe two next week which would be
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%

Thursday we're going to do bills
 
05:23:27.110 --> 05:23:27.120 align:start position:0%

05:23:29.830 --> 05:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
haven't done them yet until this
 
05:23:29.840 --> 05:23:32.350 align:start position:0%
haven't done them yet until this
Thursday

05:23:32.350 --> 05:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
05:23:34.670 --> 05:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
but Thursday the
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
4th also Thursday the
 
05:23:37.440 --> 05:23:39.910 align:start position:0%
4th also Thursday the
11th

05:23:39.910 --> 05:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
11th
 
05:23:42.230 --> 05:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:01.548 --> 05:24:01.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:04.470 --> 05:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
revenues around the
 
05:24:06.430 --> 05:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
16th of
 
05:24:09.628 --> 05:24:09.638 align:start position:0%
February and after the Governor presents
 
05:24:13.350 --> 05:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
his budget want to sit down have
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget director sit down with
 
05:24:18.628 --> 05:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
us and we go over his
 
05:24:21.548 --> 05:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
revenues and so that
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
he so that we can understand what his re
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
revenues consist
 
05:24:26.878 --> 05:24:28.788 align:start position:0%
revenues consist
of

05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:24:32.350 --> 05:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
because we project our revenues strictly
 
05:24:36.270 --> 05:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
on current law his revenues would might
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
be a combination of current law
 
05:24:39.480 --> 05:24:41.350 align:start position:0%
be a combination of current law
and

05:24:41.350 --> 05:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:41.360 --> 05:24:43.990 align:start position:0%
and
changes

05:24:43.990 --> 05:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:24:47.150 --> 05:24:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh and proposed legislation that he has
 
05:24:51.070 --> 05:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
in his budget so we'll get that square
 
05:24:54.990 --> 05:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
away and then we want to close through
 
05:24:55.000 --> 05:24:56.948 align:start position:0%
away and then we want to close through
the

05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
uh end of April I mean February we want
 
05:25:03.628 --> 05:25:03.638 align:start position:0%
to come out with the revenues so we can
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
give them to the uh finance
 
05:25:07.320 --> 05:25:09.510 align:start position:0%
give them to the uh finance
committee

05:25:09.510 --> 05:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we're planning on doing
 
05:25:14.910 --> 05:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
so tomorrow I should be able to announce
 
05:25:16.470 --> 05:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
we definitely going to have work
 
05:25:19.470 --> 05:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
sessions on Tuesday and possibly
 
05:25:25.310 --> 05:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.390 --> 05:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
week um also we need to make up our mind
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
whether the work sessions are going to
 
05:25:34.030 --> 05:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
be complete
 
05:25:34.040 --> 05:25:37.230 align:start position:0%
be complete
virtual

05:25:37.230 --> 05:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:37.240 --> 05:25:39.430 align:start position:0%
 
or

05:25:39.430 --> 05:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:25:39.440 --> 05:25:40.390 align:start position:0%
or
like

05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:25:44.230 --> 05:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing um
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
our public
 
05:25:46.558 --> 05:25:48.070 align:start position:0%

05:25:50.360 --> 05:26:04.628 align:start position:0%
so hopefully I can give you that
information

05:26:04.628 --> 05:26:04.638 align:start position:0%

you today about the tobacco Master
 
05:32:54.990 --> 05:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement my understanding is
 
05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
that there are some new committee
 
05:32:59.310 --> 05:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
members maybe some people that are not
 
05:33:01.510 --> 05:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with the master
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement beyond what they've
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
seen in the news or were aware of things
 
05:33:09.390 --> 05:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
that were going on 20 years ago we have
 
05:33:12.948 --> 05:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
nine members there no yeah well that I'm
 
05:33:15.868 --> 05:33:15.878 align:start position:0%
ready to uh to discuss some history
 
05:33:19.110 --> 05:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
which will be of uh you know varying
 
05:33:21.070 --> 05:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
degrees of interest to people and then
 
05:33:23.270 --> 05:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
get to the part that um that you're
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
probably more interested in as quickly
 
05:33:28.390 --> 05:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
as I can so I'm here to talk about the
 
05:33:30.310 --> 05:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
tobacco Master settlement agreement
 
05:33:33.390 --> 05:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
it'll be referred to as the MSA quite
 
05:33:37.030 --> 05:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
frequently um in the 1990s several
 
05:33:38.270 --> 05:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
States SU
 
05:33:40.708 --> 05:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
the four largest tobacco companies to
 
05:33:42.830 --> 05:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
recover taxpayer money that was being
 
05:33:45.390 --> 05:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
spent to treat residents that had tobac
 
05:33:47.350 --> 05:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
related illnesses there were a lot of
 
05:33:49.750 --> 05:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
medical expenses in the states wanted
 
05:33:51.628 --> 05:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
tobacco companies who they believed were
 
05:33:55.270 --> 05:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for those costs to pay that
 
05:33:59.070 --> 05:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
in 1998 52 States and territories
 
05:34:01.548 --> 05:34:01.558 align:start position:0%
settled with the four largest tobacco
 
05:34:03.830 --> 05:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
companies at the time and entered into
 
05:34:06.750 --> 05:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
the master settlement agreement or MSA
 
05:34:09.350 --> 05:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
over time 40 additional tobacco
 
05:34:12.708 --> 05:34:12.718 align:start position:0%
companies have joined the MSA so what
 
05:34:15.190 --> 05:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
was the purpose of the MSA it was to
 
05:34:17.670 --> 05:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
reduce smoking in the United States
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
especially with youth so that's
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
something to keep in mind when you think
 
05:34:25.230 --> 05:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
of the MSA the purpose of it was not to
 
05:34:28.070 --> 05:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh create a ongoing stream of Revenue to
 
05:34:30.390 --> 05:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
the states it was to reduce smoking
 
05:34:32.708 --> 05:34:32.718 align:start position:0%
rates with the hope of eventually uh
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
eliminating smoking in the United States
 
05:34:37.868 --> 05:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
uh this was accomplished by first
 
05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
raising the cost of cigarettes with MSA
 
05:34:44.190 --> 05:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
payments especially with youth if you
 
05:34:46.070 --> 05:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
think about teenagers being very
 
05:34:48.788 --> 05:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
responsive to prices as the price of
 
05:34:51.510 --> 05:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
cigarettes go up teenagers would be less
 
05:34:53.470 --> 05:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
able to afford cigarettes would never
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
start smoking as teenagers and would
 
05:34:57.948 --> 05:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
hopefully never become adult
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
smokers restrictions in advertising were
 
05:35:02.070 --> 05:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
05:35:05.150 --> 05:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
MSA easy way to think of that is no more
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
Joe Camel no more Winston cup uh with
 
05:35:13.708 --> 05:35:13.718 align:start position:0%
NASCAR no more large Billboards for
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco advertising and things like that
 
05:35:19.628 --> 05:35:19.638 align:start position:0%
eliminating the practice of tobacco
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
companies obscuring health risks there
 
05:35:24.670 --> 05:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
were uh groups like The Tobacco
 
05:35:26.830 --> 05:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
Institute if you ever saw the movie
 
05:35:29.310 --> 05:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
Thank You for Smoking or read the book
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
uh there's a fictional character in
 
05:35:31.868 --> 05:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
there that works for the tobacco
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
companies they had these very large
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
well-funded research organizations that
 
05:35:40.750 --> 05:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
produced huge amounts of research
 
05:35:42.910 --> 05:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
showing that cigarettes were not bad for
 
05:35:46.310 --> 05:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
you and created a lot of uh
 
05:35:48.190 --> 05:35:48.200 align:start position:0%
misinformation so they're no long they
 
05:35:49.910 --> 05:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
agreed to stop doing
 
05:35:53.070 --> 05:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
that and then also funding educational
 
05:35:55.190 --> 05:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
programs that are now known known as the
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
truth initiative to help educate
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
particularly young people about the
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
dangers of cigarette smoking and uh they
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
do this with commercials that you may
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
see on TV if you have uh younger
 
05:36:12.030 --> 05:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
children you may these ads are targeted
 
05:36:14.750 --> 05:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
so you won't see them on all media but
 
05:36:17.190 --> 05:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
if you're watching youth programming
 
05:36:18.990 --> 05:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
then you'll see these advertisements
 
05:36:21.708 --> 05:36:21.718 align:start position:0%
they have websites they're very active
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
on social media trying to counter the
 
05:36:28.350 --> 05:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
idea that young people have of smoking
 
05:36:30.868 --> 05:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
being something that's positive and uh
 
05:36:33.948 --> 05:36:33.958 align:start position:0%
they also get people that are they're
 
05:36:35.628 --> 05:36:35.638 align:start position:0%
known as like ambassadors or something
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
like that that work on high schools and
 
05:36:40.910 --> 05:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
College campuses basically trying to get
 
05:36:42.868 --> 05:36:42.878 align:start position:0%
the message across that cigarettes are
 
05:36:44.830 --> 05:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
still bad for you even if you're
 
05:36:47.510 --> 05:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
watching you know Mad Men on Netflix and
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
it looks cool that D Draper smoking that
 
05:36:51.708 --> 05:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
you should not start smoking that it was
 
05:36:54.350 --> 05:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
going to cause you a lot of problems did
 
05:36:56.830 --> 05:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
it work yes absolutely there's no
 
05:36:59.548 --> 05:36:59.558 align:start position:0%
question the MSA performed as designed
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
between 1998 when uh the states and the
 
05:37:05.830 --> 05:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco companies entered into the MSA
 
05:37:09.190 --> 05:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
in 2019 you us cigarette smoking uh
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
declined by more than
 
05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
50% and you can see this just by walking
 
05:37:15.110 --> 05:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
around that you just see fewer people
 
05:37:18.190 --> 05:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
smoking now than you did even you know
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
20 years ago so it's been a major
 
05:37:24.868 --> 05:37:24.878 align:start position:0%
success uh even more importantly to to
 
05:37:26.788 --> 05:37:26.798 align:start position:0%
our future because if people don't start
 
05:37:29.110 --> 05:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
smoking as young people they will not be
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
adult smokers you don't hear about
 
05:37:33.230 --> 05:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
people starting to smoke when they're in
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
their 30s or 40s it's people start when
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
they're teenagers so rates of high
 
05:37:41.070 --> 05:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
school smokers it declined from a high
 
05:37:43.548 --> 05:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
in 1997 of
 
05:37:45.750 --> 05:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
36.4% so if you think about that over a
 
05:37:47.270 --> 05:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
third of high school students were
 
05:37:51.270 --> 05:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
smoking in the late 1990s and then 2019
 
05:37:54.750 --> 05:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
it went to just just around 6% so that's
 
05:37:57.830 --> 05:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
a a huge change in 20 years well 22
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
years so a big big difference and uh the
 
05:38:04.868 --> 05:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
MSA is a big part of that with the big
 
05:38:08.310 --> 05:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
increases in cigarette prices so so a
 
05:38:10.230 --> 05:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
group that helps us with um all of this
 
05:38:12.430 --> 05:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
is nag the National Association of
 
05:38:14.830 --> 05:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General they have a center for
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco and public health so they work
 
05:38:19.948 --> 05:38:19.958 align:start position:0%
with the settling states to preserve and
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
enforce the MSA so they have attorneys
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
and support staff that do various things
 
05:38:28.110 --> 05:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
for the states and helping with the MSA
 
05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
so they work with the settling States
 
05:38:32.750 --> 05:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
the tobacco companies the independent
 
05:38:36.310 --> 05:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
auditor who is a an accounting firm
 
05:38:37.830 --> 05:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
price waterhous Cooper that they go
 
05:38:39.628 --> 05:38:39.638 align:start position:0%
through this enormous amount of sales
 
05:38:42.350 --> 05:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
data to figure out the payments to all
 
05:38:44.310 --> 05:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
the states it's it's quite something
 
05:38:45.628 --> 05:38:45.638 align:start position:0%
that they go through every year to
 
05:38:47.548 --> 05:38:47.558 align:start position:0%
figure this out and it's why we don't
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
know the final number until the check
 
05:38:51.990 --> 05:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's not even a check but when the wire
 
05:38:53.910 --> 05:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
transfer goes through to the states
 
05:38:55.310 --> 05:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's when we actually know because
 
05:38:57.150 --> 05:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
they figure it down to the penny for how
 
05:39:00.510 --> 05:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
much money you get and uh they represent
 
05:39:01.868 --> 05:39:01.878 align:start position:0%
the settling States and bankruptcy
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
matters some of these tobacco companies
 
05:39:09.030 --> 05:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
do go bankrupt and
 
05:39:12.390 --> 05:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
us repres those Bank
 
05:39:16.310 --> 05:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
hearings and between the states a big
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
part of my week uh calls
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
talk is my it's my internet connection
 
05:39:26.070 --> 05:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
05:39:28.990 --> 05:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
me it's getting
 
05:39:33.548 --> 05:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
spotty ah I apologize I xinity has been
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
not so great um so they I talk with
 
05:39:40.548 --> 05:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General at um their staff in
 
05:39:42.670 --> 05:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
all of the settling States multiple
 
05:39:44.990 --> 05:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
times a week to talk about how we're all
 
05:39:48.270 --> 05:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
doing with uh tobacco matters so what
 
05:39:50.430 --> 05:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
about tobacco companies that did not
 
05:39:52.430 --> 05:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
join the MSA so not all tobacco
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
companies decided to settle with the
 
05:39:56.590 --> 05:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
states some of these didn't exist at the
 
05:39:58.510 --> 05:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
time some of them were small foreign
 
05:40:00.670 --> 05:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
companies that came into the market
 
05:40:03.430 --> 05:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
after who saw an opportunity now that
 
05:40:05.230 --> 05:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds are
 
05:40:07.070 --> 05:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
writing these big checks that they
 
05:40:08.430 --> 05:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
thought they could undercut them on
 
05:40:10.468 --> 05:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
price so these are known as
 
05:40:13.910 --> 05:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
non-participating manufacturers or npms
 
05:40:15.788 --> 05:40:15.798 align:start position:0%
they usually focus on low cost
 
05:40:19.430 --> 05:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
cigarettes they're known as tier 4
 
05:40:23.390 --> 05:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
subgeneric cigarettes so if you're at
 
05:40:25.150 --> 05:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
the convenience store grocery store you
 
05:40:26.628 --> 05:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
typically aren't going to see these
 
05:40:30.670 --> 05:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
cigarettes these are very very lowcost
 
05:40:34.830 --> 05:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
cigarettes um if if you were to see them
 
05:40:37.030 --> 05:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
they'd be on the very bottom shelf near
 
05:40:37.040 --> 05:40:37.750 align:start position:0%
they'd be on the very bottom shelf near
the

05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:40.270 --> 05:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
ground uh these are the lowest of
 
05:40:42.910 --> 05:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
lowcost cigarettes so that's the market
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
that they are uh that they're targeting
 
05:40:47.788 --> 05:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
so we have a separate law that the
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
legislature enacted RSA 541c that these
 
05:40:54.110 --> 05:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturers have to comply with it was
 
05:40:56.230 --> 05:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
designed to eliminate the price
 
05:40:58.110 --> 05:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
advantage that they had over the
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
participating manufacturers so they are
 
05:41:03.150 --> 05:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
required to deposit money into escrow
 
05:41:05.350 --> 05:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
accounts it has to stay in there for a
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
minimum of 25 years it causes them to
 
05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
lose some of their price advantage that
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
they could potentially have with the
 
05:41:12.000 --> 05:41:13.190 align:start position:0%
they could potentially have with the
participating

05:41:13.190 --> 05:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
participating
 
05:41:15.468 --> 05:41:15.478 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and it ensures that
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
there's money there so if a state were
 
05:41:20.110 --> 05:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
to file a lawsuit against them that they
 
05:41:22.270 --> 05:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't uh declare bankruptcy and have
 
05:41:24.548 --> 05:41:24.558 align:start position:0%
uh and be judgment proof so it protects
 
05:41:27.468 --> 05:41:27.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
well so that's a major part of my job is
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
making sure that they're making those
 
05:41:36.270 --> 05:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
escrow payments we have four active npms
 
05:41:37.590 --> 05:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire if you're
 
05:41:40.468 --> 05:41:40.478 align:start position:0%
curious they are Korean tobacco and jins
 
05:41:43.910 --> 05:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
sing which is out of South Korea Grand
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
River Enterprises which is out of Canada
 
05:41:49.548 --> 05:41:49.558 align:start position:0%
and we have two American companies oasi
 
05:41:49.558 --> 05:41:50.310 align:start position:0%
and we have two American companies oasi
and

05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
Xcalibur which uh sell cigarettes in New
 
05:41:55.070 --> 05:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are many more npms out
 
05:41:56.830 --> 05:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
there but we only have four that sell
 
05:41:57.910 --> 05:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
05:41:59.990 --> 05:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you may be saying okay
 
05:42:02.468 --> 05:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
that's enough what about the money so
 
05:42:05.750 --> 05:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
since these payments began in 1999 New
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has received over
 
05:42:07.798 --> 05:42:09.548 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has received over
$952

05:42:09.548 --> 05:42:09.558 align:start position:0%
$952
 
05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
million in payments so little New
 
05:42:13.230 --> 05:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has gotten close to a billion
 
05:42:15.350 --> 05:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
dollars over the course of the
 
05:42:18.830 --> 05:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
MSA so since 2014 the payments have
 
05:42:22.230 --> 05:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
ranged from a high of just under $46
 
05:42:26.310 --> 05:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
million 45.9 million and then in 2018 is
 
05:42:29.230 --> 05:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
the low at $ 41.4
 
05:42:31.948 --> 05:42:31.958 align:start position:0%
million and what what impacts these
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
payments why do they vary so they adjust
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
upward based on inflation we're in a
 
05:42:40.150 --> 05:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
non-inflationary environment right now
 
05:42:42.390 --> 05:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
as you likely know but the agreement
 
05:42:45.070 --> 05:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
calls for a minimum 3% inflation in the
 
05:42:47.468 --> 05:42:47.478 align:start position:0%
payment so the inflation causes the
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
payment to go up each
 
05:42:52.270 --> 05:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
year then they go down for other reasons
 
05:42:55.270 --> 05:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
so the decrease in the National tobacco
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
market again remember the point of the
 
05:43:00.030 --> 05:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
MSA was to decrease cigarette sales so
 
05:43:03.430 --> 05:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is happening as designed so last
 
05:43:05.590 --> 05:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
year the decline in sales was
 
05:43:13.510 --> 05:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:15.830 --> 05:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
Nationwide it's adjust into downward
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
again for npm sales as they increase so
 
05:43:21.468 --> 05:43:21.478 align:start position:0%
those little companies I talked about uh
 
05:43:24.190 --> 05:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
they're growing they started off as
 
05:43:26.190 --> 05:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
close to 0% of the market and they're
 
05:43:29.350 --> 05:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
gradually increasing as more consumers
 
05:43:32.948 --> 05:43:32.958 align:start position:0%
uh decide to go with the uh cheaper
 
05:43:35.390 --> 05:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
alternatives so they're switching from
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
premium cigarettes like you know the
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
Philip Morris products they're no longer
 
05:43:42.548 --> 05:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
smoking maros as their finances change
 
05:43:43.948 --> 05:43:43.958 align:start position:0%
they're going with lower and lower and
 
05:43:47.468 --> 05:43:47.478 align:start position:0%
lower cost um options so as those
 
05:43:51.548 --> 05:43:51.558 align:start position:0%
increase their sales the um the the
 
05:43:54.150 --> 05:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
auditor looks at it and if they can see
 
05:43:57.310 --> 05:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
that if they attribute the decrease in
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
the participating manufacturer sales is
 
05:44:03.788 --> 05:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
related to that increase in npm sales
 
05:44:06.548 --> 05:44:06.558 align:start position:0%
then there can be a decrease in the um
 
05:44:08.510 --> 05:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the payment
 
05:44:09.990 --> 05:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
and then the most important part of my
 
05:44:13.030 --> 05:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
job is the non- diligent enforcement of
 
05:44:15.948 --> 05:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
the statute so there's the SE paid
 
05:44:19.070 --> 05:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
adjustment which is the state excise tax
 
05:44:21.548 --> 05:44:21.558 align:start position:0%
so any cigarette that's sold in the
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire by an npm there
 
05:44:25.670 --> 05:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
has to be a corresponding escrow deposit
 
05:44:29.310 --> 05:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
made so I work with uh the folks over at
 
05:44:31.468 --> 05:44:31.478 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue I make sure
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
that every cigarette that they've
 
05:44:35.948 --> 05:44:35.958 align:start position:0%
collected tax on that there is an escro
 
05:44:37.628 --> 05:44:37.638 align:start position:0%
payment made for it
 
05:44:39.750 --> 05:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
there is a separate independent auditor
 
05:44:42.230 --> 05:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
that goes over those results and if they
 
05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
determine that we have not met Our
 
05:44:47.708 --> 05:44:47.718 align:start position:0%
obligation then they can reduce the
 
05:44:50.190 --> 05:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
payment uh that we receive so that has
 
05:44:52.670 --> 05:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
not happened we've uh done a good job
 
05:44:54.310 --> 05:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that escro payments are made
 
05:44:57.070 --> 05:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
for all of these uh cigarettes sold and
 
05:44:58.708 --> 05:44:58.718 align:start position:0%
our payment has not been
 
05:45:01.868 --> 05:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
reduced so the recent trend is downward
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
as I said in
 
05:45:07.868 --> 05:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
2018 just under $46 million 45 9 million
 
05:45:12.190 --> 05:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
for the MSA payment in 2019 it was
 
05:45:17.548 --> 05:45:17.558 align:start position:0%
44.5 million in 2020 42.6
 
05:45:19.830 --> 05:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
million so the predictions moving
 
05:45:23.070 --> 05:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
forward I've spoken with uh nag with the
 
05:45:25.670 --> 05:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco council at nag their prediction
 
05:45:27.230 --> 05:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
is that there's going to be a continuing
 
05:45:30.070 --> 05:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
decline in overall cigarette sales and a
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
corresponding decrease in MSA
 
05:45:35.670 --> 05:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
payments if you look at the the memo
 
05:45:38.230 --> 05:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
there that uh is on the screen the
 
05:45:42.868 --> 05:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
current estimate in 2021 payment is 38.4
 
05:45:48.548 --> 05:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
million 2022 is 38.2 million and 2023 is
 
05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
$3 36.3
 
05:45:53.708 --> 05:45:53.718 align:start position:0%
million um they are hesitant to make any
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
adjustments at this time because we do
 
05:45:59.070 --> 05:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
not yet know what the impact of covid-19
 
05:46:02.788 --> 05:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
on cigarette sales is uh it could be
 
05:46:04.910 --> 05:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
that people with more time on their
 
05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
hands have increased their smoking and
 
05:46:10.468 --> 05:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
that they are continuing to buy the
 
05:46:13.548 --> 05:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
premium Brands it could be that they
 
05:46:16.190 --> 05:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
have switched due to finances to lower
 
05:46:20.948 --> 05:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
cost brands or if people switched to uh
 
05:46:24.468 --> 05:46:24.478 align:start position:0%
vaping ecigarettes um other nicotine
 
05:46:26.310 --> 05:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
products that are out there that are not
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
covered by the MSA these new nicotine
 
05:46:32.350 --> 05:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
lenes or things like that or if they
 
05:46:33.590 --> 05:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
decide they're going to take an
 
05:46:36.548 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to quit smoking now that
 
05:46:40.948 --> 05:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
would further decrease uh tobacco sales
 
05:46:44.548 --> 05:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
in the MSA payments but we do not know
 
05:46:46.868 --> 05:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
yet we'll when when the checks come
 
05:46:49.150 --> 05:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
rolling in we'll get the final answer on
 
05:46:52.390 --> 05:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
what the uh the impact was on Tobacco
 
05:46:55.070 --> 05:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
sales in
 
05:46:57.830 --> 05:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
2020 does anyone have any questions and
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
the checks uh come in when what month in
 
05:47:08.150 --> 05:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
April let me get the actually have
 
05:47:14.070 --> 05:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:22.230 --> 05:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:24.750 --> 05:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
up just give me one second I can pull up
 
05:47:24.760 --> 05:47:35.830 align:start position:0%
up just give me one second I can pull up
the

05:47:35.830 --> 05:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:35.840 --> 05:47:47.468 align:start position:0%
 
calendar

05:47:47.468 --> 05:47:47.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
I apologize that
 
05:47:51.468 --> 05:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
is I had been thinking that is something
 
05:47:52.628 --> 05:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
that I would have
 
05:47:57.230 --> 05:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:01.270 --> 05:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
that we need to come up with
 
05:48:07.350 --> 05:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
revenues by the end of February
 
05:48:11.590 --> 05:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
and then uh we'll look at them again by
 
05:48:15.910 --> 05:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
the time that the house votes on the
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
budget and and sends it over to the
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
Senate and I doubt if we have the the
 
05:48:27.548 --> 05:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
value of what the payment will be at
 
05:48:29.150 --> 05:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
that point in
 
05:48:31.910 --> 05:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
time the only time we'll be able to use
 
05:48:34.868 --> 05:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
that is when we do the committee of
 
05:48:37.868 --> 05:48:37.878 align:start position:0%
conference which will be in j June and
 
05:48:39.948 --> 05:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
we deal with the
 
05:48:42.350 --> 05:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
Senate but we're going to be looking at
 
05:48:44.510 --> 05:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
our revenues again anyway at that point
 
05:48:44.520 --> 05:48:50.150 align:start position:0%
our revenues again anyway at that point
in

05:48:50.150 --> 05:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:52.830 --> 05:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
time according to this that pulled up
 
05:48:54.270 --> 05:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
it's April
 
05:48:54.280 --> 05:48:58.990 align:start position:0%
it's April
22nd

05:48:58.990 --> 05:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:05.708 --> 05:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
year is that
 
05:49:10.750 --> 05:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
it yes that that is all I have if anyone
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
has any questions I'm happy to uh do my
 
05:49:15.390 --> 05:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
best to answer them and if if I need to
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
I can look it up and get back to uh the
 
05:49:19.788 --> 05:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
committee if I don't have the answer
 
05:49:22.270 --> 05:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
handy we have three lined up of
 
05:49:25.868 --> 05:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
questions first is represent alen
 
05:49:28.310 --> 05:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
Bernstein thank you Mr Sharon thank you
 
05:49:31.948 --> 05:49:31.958 align:start position:0%
Mr Sison um my question it might be
 
05:49:34.110 --> 05:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
better for Christopher Shay to answer
 
05:49:36.750 --> 05:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
this or perhaps the chair or or Mr
 
05:49:38.708 --> 05:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
listen what I'm doing is I'm comparing
 
05:49:40.910 --> 05:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
your memo specifically the third
 
05:49:43.390 --> 05:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph where we talk about where you
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
reference how much we've received in
 
05:49:49.390 --> 05:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
2019 and 2020 and I'm comparing that to
 
05:49:52.468 --> 05:49:52.478 align:start position:0%
the caffer page
 
05:49:56.910 --> 05:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
146 and the uh the 2019 number ties to
 
05:50:01.468 --> 05:50:01.478 align:start position:0%
the penny the 2020 number is is nowhere
 
05:50:01.478 --> 05:50:03.110 align:start position:0%
the penny the 2020 number is is nowhere
close

05:50:03.110 --> 05:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
close
 
05:50:07.030 --> 05:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
um it it's showing just under 26 million
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
was collected in 2020 this is per the
 
05:50:14.190 --> 05:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
caffer page 146 and I just can't
 
05:50:16.350 --> 05:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
reconcile the difference between 42
 
05:50:21.070 --> 05:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
million and 26 million uh Chris or Norm
 
05:50:23.788 --> 05:50:23.798 align:start position:0%
can can anybody help me out here um I
 
05:50:25.230 --> 05:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that question
 
05:50:27.310 --> 05:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
represent burin but I I can look into
 
05:50:28.590 --> 05:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
that and get back to the committee and
 
05:50:29.788 --> 05:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
see why there's
 
05:50:32.910 --> 05:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
difference seems like that 26 million is
 
05:50:32.920 --> 05:50:35.468 align:start position:0%
difference seems like that 26 million is
way

05:50:35.468 --> 05:50:35.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:39.190 --> 05:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
off yeah it it it might just be a typo
 
05:50:41.270 --> 05:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at the number uh per the
 
05:50:42.910 --> 05:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
memo it's
 
05:50:42.920 --> 05:50:44.830 align:start position:0%
memo it's
42,5

05:50:44.830 --> 05:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
42,5
 
05:50:47.670 --> 05:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
199,000 it it looks like a digit was
 
05:50:50.468 --> 05:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
dropped off of that so maybe it's just a
 
05:50:53.350 --> 05:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
typo um anyway let's give Chris a chance
 
05:50:56.430 --> 05:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
to take a look at it and Chris will get
 
05:50:59.150 --> 05:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
back with that y I'll I'll get hopefully
 
05:51:00.510 --> 05:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
I'll get something by the end of today
 
05:51:01.788 --> 05:51:01.798 align:start position:0%
and so tomorrow I'll be able to answer
 
05:51:04.830 --> 05:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
the question when you guys meet okay
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:13.070 --> 05:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay am I still on yeah
 
05:51:17.310 --> 05:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh so my question has to do with the uh
 
05:51:20.510 --> 05:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
both the black market and vaping and uh
 
05:51:23.110 --> 05:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
impact on uh trends
 
05:51:24.990 --> 05:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
05:51:27.390 --> 05:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
taxable sales of
 
05:51:29.948 --> 05:51:29.958 align:start position:0%
cigarettes maybe uh any information you
 
05:51:32.110 --> 05:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
have on that score would be helpful to
 
05:51:35.350 --> 05:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
us yes so um ecigarettes as you know are
 
05:51:37.430 --> 05:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
taxed in New Hampshire so sales of
 
05:51:40.708 --> 05:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes vaping things whatever
 
05:51:42.788 --> 05:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
terminology you want to use are taxed so
 
05:51:45.390 --> 05:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
there is tax revenue coming in however
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
they are not underneath the master
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement so there is no MSA
 
05:51:52.868 --> 05:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
payment that goes along with those um
 
05:51:55.430 --> 05:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
with black market uh cigarettes there
 
05:51:56.788 --> 05:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
then there would be nothing there would
 
05:51:58.670 --> 05:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
be no tax revenue those would not be
 
05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
part of the MSA um I've spoken with
 
05:52:04.868 --> 05:52:04.878 align:start position:0%
people over at the uh Liquor Commission
 
05:52:07.390 --> 05:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
who are out there looking for for it and
 
05:52:09.548 --> 05:52:09.558 align:start position:0%
looking for Contraband and when they
 
05:52:13.190 --> 05:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
find it it's confiscated and um and they
 
05:52:15.708 --> 05:52:15.718 align:start position:0%
prosecute those that they find so New
 
05:52:17.868 --> 05:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is making sure that we are
 
05:52:19.750 --> 05:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
finding those and that there's not
 
05:52:23.788 --> 05:52:23.798 align:start position:0%
illegal tobacco um something that to
 
05:52:26.468 --> 05:52:26.478 align:start position:0%
keep in mind is that we have um compared
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
to our neighbors a lower uh cigarette
 
05:52:31.750 --> 05:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
tax so there's less of an incentive for
 
05:52:35.030 --> 05:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
people to break the law and bring non-
 
05:52:37.430 --> 05:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
tax cigarettes into new h sure it would
 
05:52:39.030 --> 05:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
not make a lot of sense unless they were
 
05:52:41.150 --> 05:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
to go all the way down to Pennsylvania
 
05:52:43.270 --> 05:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
all of the Northeast we have the lowest
 
05:52:45.628 --> 05:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
cigarette tax so we would have the uh
 
05:52:48.590 --> 05:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
the least incentive to why risk it why
 
05:52:51.708 --> 05:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
risk breaking the law with us to it
 
05:52:52.868 --> 05:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make any
 
05:52:55.390 --> 05:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
sense okay before we go to the next
 
05:53:00.030 --> 05:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
question uh Allan I looked up the
 
05:53:03.628 --> 05:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
revenue Focus for June
 
05:53:09.430 --> 05:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
of 2020 which is the of Fisco money and
 
05:53:11.590 --> 05:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
the tobacco settlement money that came
 
05:53:16.390 --> 05:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
in for that year which is 42.6 million
 
05:53:18.390 --> 05:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
so it
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
must there's a problem there because the
 
05:53:24.628 --> 05:53:24.638 align:start position:0%
focus shows
 
05:53:24.638 --> 05:53:27.150 align:start position:0%
focus shows
42.6

05:53:27.150 --> 05:53:27.160 align:start position:0%
42.6
 
05:53:31.110 --> 05:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
um rep major if I might yeah the answer
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
to the question is you're page 146 of
 
05:53:35.750 --> 05:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
the cafer is only the general fund
 
05:53:35.760 --> 05:53:37.390 align:start position:0%
the cafer is only the general fund
portion

05:53:37.390 --> 05:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
portion
 
05:53:39.548 --> 05:53:39.558 align:start position:0%
the first $40 million of the settlement
 
05:53:41.310 --> 05:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
goes directly into the education trust
 
05:53:43.910 --> 05:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
fund yes so there was
 
05:53:46.350 --> 05:53:46.360 align:start position:0%
42 and change collected in the
 
05:53:47.628 --> 05:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
settlement last year so you're seeing
 
05:53:49.708 --> 05:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
the 2.5 million that went to the general
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:57.830 --> 05:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
148 you'll see the $40 million for the
 
05:54:01.670 --> 05:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:05.510 --> 05:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
settlement wow education Chris thank you
 
05:54:07.430 --> 05:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
you're welcome sorry didn't get it right
 
05:54:14.190 --> 05:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:16.788 --> 05:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
Bron this wasn't my original question I
 
05:54:19.030 --> 05:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
I was want to ask Chris so what happens
 
05:54:22.868 --> 05:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
this year if uh revenues go uh below 40
 
05:54:25.628 --> 05:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
million how's that made up that's not my
 
05:54:29.830 --> 05:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
question of the of the uh speaker so for
 
05:54:33.990 --> 05:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
Chris so um represent brami the first
 
05:54:36.670 --> 05:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
$40 million of the tobacco settlement so
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
goes directly into the education trust
 
05:54:40.110 --> 05:54:40.120 align:start position:0%
fund so if there's a number less than 40
 
05:54:41.830 --> 05:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
million it just all goes to the tobac
 
05:54:43.628 --> 05:54:43.638 align:start position:0%
education trust fund it has to be made
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
up some benefit is when you get
 
05:54:47.548 --> 05:54:47.558 align:start position:0%
something over 40 million then it drops
 
05:54:49.670 --> 05:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
into the um general fund and you have
 
05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
the ability to use it in other places in
 
05:54:51.360 --> 05:54:52.270 align:start position:0%
the ability to use it in other places in
the

05:54:52.270 --> 05:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:54.990 --> 05:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
budget okay thank you and the uh real
 
05:54:57.190 --> 05:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
question is so in the tech that's coming
 
05:54:57.200 --> 05:54:58.030 align:start position:0%
question is so in the tech that's coming
on

05:54:58.030 --> 05:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:55:00.468 --> 05:55:00.478 align:start position:0%
April that's and the formula that use
 
05:55:02.750 --> 05:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
for that that check through for all the
 
05:55:05.430 --> 05:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
states that participate in this uh is
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
based on the cigarette at sales in what
 
05:55:11.468 --> 05:55:11.478 align:start position:0%
period is it calendar or calendar uh 20
 
05:55:14.548 --> 05:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
or do you know it would be from S Sales
 
05:55:14.558 --> 05:55:15.948 align:start position:0%
or do you know it would be from S Sales
year

05:55:15.948 --> 05:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
2020 calendar year 20 calendar yes sir
 
05:55:22.830 --> 05:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yes so that would be mostly in the
 
05:55:25.788 --> 05:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh the period of the covid N you know
 
05:55:28.750 --> 05:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
three quarters of that year is co months
 
05:55:29.868 --> 05:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
yes and this is something we've been
 
05:55:34.270 --> 05:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
talking about I've I it's it's going to
 
05:55:37.590 --> 05:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
be interesting to see what the impact is
 
05:55:40.750 --> 05:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
and what changes in consumer Behavior
 
05:55:42.868 --> 05:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
because it has been a complete change in
 
05:55:46.070 --> 05:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
people's lives and every way so um no
 
05:55:48.350 --> 05:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
one feels comfortable guessing what the
 
05:55:50.910 --> 05:55:50.920 align:start position:0%
final outcome is going to be but we will
 
05:55:55.788 --> 05:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
know okay than follow up on that is the
 
05:56:00.110 --> 05:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
sale of the tobacco stamps in 2020
 
05:56:04.750 --> 05:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
versus 2019 have you looked at that so
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with the Department of
 
05:56:10.390 --> 05:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh they track um for for me the
 
05:56:13.948 --> 05:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
npm sales so we track those very tightly
 
05:56:16.350 --> 05:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
because of the escro requirements with
 
05:56:20.310 --> 05:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
the um the participating manufacturers
 
05:56:23.110 --> 05:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
so that they don't have those um the
 
05:56:26.430 --> 05:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
reporting on that done so the the stamps
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
are purchased by wholesalers and the
 
05:56:30.788 --> 05:56:30.798 align:start position:0%
certified stamping agents so those
 
05:56:33.270 --> 05:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily all applied they
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
weren't all applied in 2020 they could
 
05:56:36.868 --> 05:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
have gotten some that
 
05:56:38.910 --> 05:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
are still to be applied in
 
05:56:41.750 --> 05:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
2021 but when they finish they will have
 
05:56:45.070 --> 05:56:45.080 align:start position:0%
a final number on that but they do not
 
05:56:48.670 --> 05:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
have it yet we're usually more concerned
 
05:56:55.150 --> 05:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:57.628 --> 05:56:57.638 align:start position:0%
manufacturers represent
 
05:57:02.670 --> 05:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
Aly yeah and I do the does
 
05:57:07.628 --> 05:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
sales on during calendar year 20 mean uh
 
05:57:09.430 --> 05:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
sales that were completed to the
 
05:57:13.390 --> 05:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
consumer or sales that were completed on
 
05:57:16.590 --> 05:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
from the tobacco wholesaler where we tax
 
05:57:20.270 --> 05:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
it which then would divide into those
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
that paid by Bond and hadn't paid yet
 
05:57:25.548 --> 05:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
and the rest of
 
05:57:29.070 --> 05:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
them so you're asking for sales that
 
05:57:33.910 --> 05:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
factor into the MSA payment is that yes
 
05:57:37.750 --> 05:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
yes I need to check on that I know for
 
05:57:40.590 --> 05:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
escrow payment purposes it's when the
 
05:57:43.868 --> 05:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
stamp is applied so it's when the
 
05:57:46.390 --> 05:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
wholesaler sells them to the retailer
 
05:57:48.628 --> 05:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
and applies a stamp at that point
 
05:57:50.070 --> 05:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
they're considered
 
05:57:54.510 --> 05:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
sold I do not know with certainty if
 
05:57:57.310 --> 05:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
that is also when they get factored into
 
05:58:03.350 --> 05:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:06.628 --> 05:58:06.638 align:start position:0%
that and if I am getting back does make
 
05:58:09.788 --> 05:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
a difference of a month of 2020 in terms
 
05:58:14.350 --> 05:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:16.948 --> 05:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
Co yes it would it it could make a
 
05:58:19.030 --> 05:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
difference um when I get that answer
 
05:58:21.788 --> 05:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
would I send it to um Christopher Shay
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
and then he would send that or how would
 
05:58:27.430 --> 05:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
that get sent out you could send it to
 
05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:35.040 --> 05:58:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
us

05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:37.680 align:start position:0%

05:58:37.680 --> 05:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
us
further

05:58:43.670 --> 05:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
questions saying no further questions I
 
05:58:48.230 --> 05:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
I thank you very much for your
 
05:58:51.190 --> 05:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
