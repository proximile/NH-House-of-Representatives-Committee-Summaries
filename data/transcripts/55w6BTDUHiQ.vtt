00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
okay it's uh
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
just past 12 30. i see we have three
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members here so we can go
 
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
we do have a quorum
 
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
and uh my name is doug thomas i'm the
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
chair of the subcommittee for the
 
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
hb 1644
 
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
we now have four subcommittee members
 
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
we now have four subcommittee members
here

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
but we do have a time constraint so we
 
00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
we have to continue
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
we had a subcommittee meeting
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
last week we had
 
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.749 align:start position:0%
last week we had
additional

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
information that they were exchanged
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
and the main and since we went so long
 
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
last week we
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
reserved a very short time today
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
basically for our subcommittee to take a
 
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
vote on the recommendation to our our
 
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
however we do have
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that we have two
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
speakers here or will have
 
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
that came here especially i know they'll
 
00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
be testifying during the public hearing
 
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
schedule for one o'clock but i will give
 
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
them the courtesy to come here and speak
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
for no more than five minutes
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
on perhaps something that they may want
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
to expand upon when they go to public
 
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.430 align:start position:0%
to expand upon when they go to public
hearing

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.390 align:start position:0%
hearing
so

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
in order to facilitate this if i have a
 
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
pink card i guess so i just have their
 
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.150 align:start position:0%
pink card i guess so i just have their
name

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
and where they're from whoever is going
 
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
to be speaking during the public hearing
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
um is and i don't know their name i'm
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
sorry uh
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
simon do you have a
 
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.950 align:start position:0%
simon do you have a
name

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.590 align:start position:0%
name
sure

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
and then let me just look at it and then
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
i will give to nick hang on
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
is that swanson okay give it to nick
 
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's for the public that's for the
 
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.749 align:start position:0%
that's for the public that's for the
subcommittee

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:31.759 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
so if mr swanson uh would like to come
 
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
up and address the subcommittee please
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'll test this first am i
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay with you you hit the closer a
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
little bit closer how's that sound yeah
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
you can pull the mic closer to you too
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
sorry about the noise can you just say
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
your name on who you represent um my
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
name is eric swanson i've been asked by
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
ctia to come and talk to you today
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
so uh good afternoon mr chair and
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
members of the subcommittee
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
i've been asked to talk to you about
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
health and safety aspects of 5g
 
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.189 align:start position:0%
health and safety aspects of 5g
technology

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
first a few words about myself i'm a
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
physicist at the university of
 
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
physicist at the university of
pittsburgh

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a fellow of the american physical
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
society and i'm a member of the union of
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
concerned scientists
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
the opinion that i'm going to tell you
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
today is a consensus view
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
of of the scientific
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
view of the safety of 5g technology
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
as you know 5g and cell phones work with
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic waves
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
these waves are sometimes also called
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
radiation which i want to stress is not
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
nuclear radiation
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
the waves in total
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
in totality are called the spectrum
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
some parts of the spectrum are actually
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
dangerous that's in the high frequency
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
or high energy
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
end of the electromagnetic spectrum and
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with some of this x-rays
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
for instance are electromagnetic waves
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
they're high energy and
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
you don't want to expose yourself to
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
x-rays too much that's why the
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
technician leaves the room when you get
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
your your teeth x-rayed things like that
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
if you go up to even higher frequencies
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
you get to things like gamma rays which
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
are very rare in nature but they can
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
outright kill you
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
unlike in the in the movies
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
if you go to lower frequencies you get
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
to things like ultraviolet radiation so
 
00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919 align:start position:0%
ultraviolet forms part of the natural
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
light that's emitted by the sun
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
and you are well aware that if you spend
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
too long out in the sun you'll tan your
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
skin responds to this energetic incoming
 
00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
skin responds to this energetic incoming
waves

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
waves
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
by tanning and if you stay out too long
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
you might put yourself at risk of skin
 
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.950 align:start position:0%
you might put yourself at risk of skin
cancer

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
now things change dramatically just
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
below frequency just below the frequency
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
of ultraviolet radiation um that's where
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
visible light comes in so it's exactly
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
the light in
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
in this room
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
visible light is below what's called the
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
ionization threshold
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
this is a is like a step function things
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
change dramatically once you go from uv
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
radiation to visible light and below
 
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
now this non-ionizing radiation is does
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
not cause things like skin cancer it
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
acts completely differently when it
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
comes in contact with tissue and you're
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
actually aware of this at an intuitive
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
level already
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
you know that you can spend all day
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
inside underneath these lights
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get tan
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
you're certainly not going to get skin
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
cancer it doesn't matter how long you
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
stay underneath these lights
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
the reason is that the frequency and the
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
energy emitted by these lights is below
 
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
the ionization threshold
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
by the way this this was first
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
understood in 1905 by good old albert
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
einstein he's the one who first
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
explained the list
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
so the technology that we're talking
 
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.430 align:start position:0%
so the technology that we're talking
about

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.710 align:start position:0%
about
5g

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
5g
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
is higher in frequency than the older
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
technology 4g but it is still a factor
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
of 30 000 below this threshold
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i stress again that it's a threshold
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
so even if you were a factor of two
 
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
below the threshold it would still be
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
perfectly safe
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
now this radiation doesn't do nothing
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
it does have an effect on materials the
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
primary fact is that it moves things
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
around it moves molecules moves
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
electrons around and that slow motion is
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
well known to us as heat
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
so if for example you were to step out
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
into the sun
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
you would feel heat on your skin and
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
it's this is exactly the effect that
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
in fact the fcc could regulate the sun
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
if it chose to it operates at a much
 
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
higher frequency than 5g technology
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
and it's far it violates fcc regulations
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
by the way the sun would have to be
 
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.790 align:start position:0%
by the way the sun would have to be
outlawed

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
outlawed
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
by about a factor of 16.
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
so the fcc regulates this because we
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
can't see it and so
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
we can't our eyes don't detect radio
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
waves so they regulate it for us the
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
idea is that people shouldn't be exposed
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
to too much of a heating effect
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
so what they do they don't conduct
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
experiments that's something of a myth
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
they consult with national bodies and
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
international bodies thousands of
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
experiments get examined they are
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
continually reviewing experiments as
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
they come up they recently completed a
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
review of new technology of about 200
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
studies just in the past few months
 
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
what they do is they set limits
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
about a factor of 50 below anything
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
that's remotely detectable in these
 
00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.190 align:start position:0%
that's remotely detectable in these
experiments

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
experiments
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
now i can tell you what these limits are
 
00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.829 align:start position:0%
now i can tell you what these limits are
but

00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's just a number so what i'd rather do
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
is illustrate what these limits are
 
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
so to do that i want to talk about my
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
brain for a minute
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
so my brain
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
uses about 15 percent of the energy that
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
my body
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
consumes every day it's about 2 000
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
calories a day that actually works out
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
to 100 watts
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
a human is is very much in terms of
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
energy like an old-fashioned
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
incandescent light bulb
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
15 of that is 15 watts my brain weighs
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
about 2 pounds something like that and
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
what that means is that my brain
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
is operating at a a power rating of 15
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
watts per kilogram
 
00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:44.389 align:start position:0%
watts per kilogram
now

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
because it's warm it's at room
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
temperature right now that molecules in
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
my brain are jiggling around and when
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
they jiggle around they actually emit
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic radiation
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not 5g and it's not visible it's in
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
between it's called infrared radiation
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
or thermal radiation you've probably
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
seen it on you know james bond movies or
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
things like this when they're using
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
response and you have like one minute
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
please sum up thank you
 
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
um and that means that my brain and all
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
of our brains are thermal radio
 
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.069 align:start position:0%
of our brains are thermal radio
transmitters

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
transmitters
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
they violate the fcc regulations if the
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
fcc chose to regulate brains by about a
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
factor of 10.
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
so the message i'm trying to get across
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
to you is that these regulations are
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
extremely strict they are very safe
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
to summarize
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
although the the technology of 5g is new
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
the physics of 5g is the same as it's
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
always been as 4g and 3g and 2g and the
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
biology is the same
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the fcc
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
regulates this technology completely
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
adequately there's nothing to fear from
 
00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.389 align:start position:0%
adequately there's nothing to fear from
it

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your attention i'm
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions of course um
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr swanson uh
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
if anyone feels the need to answer a
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
question on the subcommittee we can or
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
we will be having a public hearing in a
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
few minutes where mr swanson will have
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to go into more detail
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
so that being said thank you for your
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
time here swanson and is there one more
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
person we have time for one more speaker
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
could you bring the pink card over to me
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
so i know your name and i'll give it to
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
our subcommittee clerk
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
mr hancock is it yes okay welcome mr
 
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.750 align:start position:0%
mr hancock is it yes okay welcome mr
hancock

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
hancock
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
you are representing yourself it says
 
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.790 align:start position:0%
you are representing yourself it says
here

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
building the minutes
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
for them in
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh canada i worked with secret service
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
with microwave transmissions across
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
the northern border of the united states
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
and i helped design a lot of the systems
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
that are used
 
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.910 align:start position:0%
that are used
today

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
this bill came to my attention because
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
of rep naughtier
 
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.030 align:start position:0%
of rep naughtier
and

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
i was quite honestly shocked at the
 
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:19.350 align:start position:0%
i was quite honestly shocked at the
misinformation

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
sorry there we go um excuse me um i hate
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
to interrupt you i was under the
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
impression that the other speaker we had
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
here was
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
is this your speaker represented
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
daughter oh i'm sorry okay go ahead
 
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.110 align:start position:0%
daughter oh i'm sorry okay go ahead
so

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
so first of all 5g is an encoding
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
standard uh it's being used by everybody
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
as a marketing standard but it's an
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
encoding standard and it's only a slight
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
modification improvement on 4g in fact
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's basically where 4g ended up and
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
they just renamed it and made a new
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
standard for it
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
the key
 
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
and i think the sole
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
concern with this
 
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
board here is that
 
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.269 align:start position:0%
board here is that
frequency

00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
frequency
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
i.e how fast the wave moves
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
and how much power that wave has
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
but as i just heard
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
the handset
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
actually produces more radiation at the
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
head than the towers do
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
and frequencies that are used by
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
cellular service are about to be put
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
into use in cellular service and in fact
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
the amount of radiation produced by
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
these cell phone towers and even your
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
handset is orders of magnitude less than
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
what came before so as an example
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
t-mobile has 5g throughout the state of
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire already
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
at t verizon also do well in case of
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
t-mobile they're their cell phone
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
service for 5g is almost exclusively in
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
television channels that less than five
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
years ago we're broadcasting at 50 000
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
watts in this state right now there was
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
i live in the keene area there was two
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
towers that had to be reassigned and
 
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
reallocated and new transmitters put up
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
both of those were over 25 000 watts
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
to be replaced by cell phone towers that
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
broadcast at
 
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
100 watts
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
in the same frequency
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
so as a result of this technology
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
not only has it gotten safer
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
not only do we have more technology in
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
the state have more communication and
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
more opportunity as a result of this
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
technology coming into play
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
we actually are producing less radiation
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
and as is noted in multiple testimonies
 
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
that i've seen
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's called the inverse square law
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
so for every meter you go from a tower
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
the power drops off
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
and power is directly equatable to how
 
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.030 align:start position:0%
and power is directly equatable to how
deep

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
deep
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
the wave will penetrate the skin
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
so as a result
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
if you've got 50 000 watts and you have
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
100 watts and they're roughly the same
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
place because yes a lot of the cell
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
phone towers are actually on radio
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
towers and television towers
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
on exactly the same frequency the cell
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
phone tower is vastly safer for
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
everybody involved
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
if we go and look at the new frequencies
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
like c-band that everybody's concerned
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
about because of
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
bad airplanes that were designed poorly
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
and have poor insulation
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
the interference is because they didn't
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
insulate anything but those same
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
frequencies were broadcasting at 50 to
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
190 000 watts
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
off of satellites that you can see today
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
the remnants of what it used to be used
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
for because of all the six foot dishes
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
that are still left in people's yards
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
but those were broadcasting at thousands
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
of times more power than the cell phone
 
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
towers are
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay even millimeter wave today
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
right now as we speak
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
there's 250 000 watts
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
of milling down
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
simply to tell us that there's a snow
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
storm coming
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
because the same frequencies that
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
they're talking about using for
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
millimeter wave of which there's no
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
implementation in new hampshire and very
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
little reason to believe that it will be
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
widespread because of the
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
characteristics of it
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere starlink satellite that
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
if you were to pass this legislation
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
would be absolutely subject to this
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's in exactly the millimeter wave
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
frequencies and you're going to cut off
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
high-speed internet access to the vast
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
majority of the state as a result
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
because there's no other feasible way to
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
provide broadband to all of coast county
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
as an example mr hancock assuming you
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
have one minute to summarize please so
 
00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
exactly like what happened with the epa
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
when they passed legislation to control
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
nuclear reactors and fuel refineries and
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
the consequence of their good intentions
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
they consequently
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
is is that because of the regulations
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
they passed we actually
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
pollute vastly more now
 
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the united states than any other
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
country in the world because of those
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
very legislations because those reactors
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
those refineries have not been upgraded
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
the same pathway has occurred and will
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
continue to occur when it comes to
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic frequencies because if
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
you block this you're blocking new
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
towers new developments lower power
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
better frequencies closer signals that
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
are of lower power and don't need to
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
broadcast so strongly as a result of
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
this so all that will remain is the old
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
legacy technology
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony i
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
will remind everyone that
 
00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
there will be time at the public hearing
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
to speak a little more in depth on this
 
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.110 align:start position:0%
to speak a little more in depth on this
again

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
i only allowed these two speakers out of
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
courtesy because they traveled some
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
distance to get here today
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
at this point i just want to say that
 
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.230 align:start position:0%
at this point i just want to say that
the

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.990 align:start position:0%
the
subcommittee

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
in some talking feels that we've heard
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
testimony pretty strongly on both sides
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the fence
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
and it's very complex unfortunately this
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
is an early bill
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
we would have liked to have been able to
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
put together an amendment to make it
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
more palpable that's something that
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
could have been used
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
but time won't
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
allow us
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:20:20.149 --> 00:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
because of this and because we believe
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
that there is something out there
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
we do understand there are some medical
 
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.430 align:start position:0%
we do understand there are some medical
issues

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
with the public
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
that cannot be denied
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
we also believe that there's heavy
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence that would point to
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
the contrary to causation
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
but we do realize that there might be
 
00:20:40.149 --> 00:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
some correlation out there we just
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
really we we can't we just don't have
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
enough time to figure out what we should
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
do about it
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
so i believe uh the subcommittee
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
is in a position to
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
make a motion of recommendation
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
to the full committee and although i
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
haven't assigned anyone that yet uh
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative white
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
would you make a motion i i believe
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
interim study uh would be the best
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
course of action
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
are you willing to make a motion to that
 
00:21:07.679 --> 00:21:08.549 align:start position:0%
are you willing to make a motion to that
uh

00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
i will i i just want to say that i've
 
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
struggled a lot personally with this
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
i've gone back and forth on this i have
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
not had the time i've only got about
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
halfway through the 400 page commission
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
report and i think one study
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
which there's thousands out there to
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
look at um
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
but yes i'll entertain that motion to
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
move this to interim study uh
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
noting that i have i have concerns about
 
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.350 align:start position:0%
noting that i have i have concerns about
this

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
motion has been made for interim study
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
as a second
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.710 align:start position:0%
representative partial
second

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion for interim
 
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.710 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion for interim
study

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
yes before us we have an amendment to
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.549 align:start position:0%
the original bill
um

00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
it does define more clearly what we do
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
mean by antenna i understand there's
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
still concerns about that
 
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.230 align:start position:0%
still concerns about that
um

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
and also removes the registry uh as
 
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.350 align:start position:0%
and also removes the registry uh as
being

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
well that could be problematic at this
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
time so we just wanted to focus on the
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
there is concern from him radio
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
operators which may
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
dictate the deep necessity for a further
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
amendment i think it's something worth
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
talking about i think it's definitely
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
worth keeping this bill alive there are
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions around this
 
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.549 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions around this
and

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:33.350 align:start position:0%
and
i

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
would prefer seeing this an otp a bill
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
because in effect that will put a
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
moratorium on the deployment of these
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
towers until we can more fully
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
repercussions of what we may be doing
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh without that moratorium i think that
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's a given a green light to the
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
industry when
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
questions remaining unanswered
 
00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.630 align:start position:0%
questions remaining unanswered
um

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
i love the idea of an interim study i
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
think this is an important issue i think
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of homework has been done already
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
and i hope we can actually
 
00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
and i hope we can actually
uh

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
oh what's the word uh vote to uh
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
vote against the uh
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
interim study though at this time and
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
give this an otpa so that we can buy the
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
time to actually study this free from
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
having it deployed
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay my understanding is that you've
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
taken into the motion for interim study
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
then maybe i better do that i'm very
 
00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:38.070 align:start position:0%
then maybe i better do that i'm very
sorry

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh a matter of convenience
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative lauder i'll second the
 
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
motion to interim study okay vote's been
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
seconded for uh interim study i'm i may
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
remind the study committee that the
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
subject of the uh
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
amendment and
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative comments can certainly be
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
made during the uh public hearing uh and
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
also when we go to executive session
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
when we actually do vote on interim
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
study those comments can meet at that
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
and your comments can be duly noted uh
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
so with with that being said thank you
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%

wanted to testify on this bill
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
but have not submitted a pink card you
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
in order to to testify
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%

of actual testimony followed by whatever
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
questions the committee might seek to
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
seek to ask
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to keep each person
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
down to
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
a total of 10 minutes so that we can get
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
through all this
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
so at that i will call on the first
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
person to testify for us today and that
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
is mark
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
doyle of the department of safety
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
the committee i want to take opportunity
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
to thank you for having me speak today
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
and specif speak specifically to the
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
public safety perspective of the impact
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill you won't be hearing from
 
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.669 align:start position:0%
of this bill you won't be hearing from
me

00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
relative to any of the science or the
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
impact on the business and industry
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
association but i think it's prudent
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
that you folks hear from
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
the public safety perspective of what
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
kind of impact the passage of this bill
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
will have
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
currently as written this bill would
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
jeopardize our ability to provide
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
emergency communications for the
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
department of safety and our statewide
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
public safety partners in the community
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
that they serve
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
as it would adversely affect
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
antenna placement for radio
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
communications specifically for our
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
statewide public safety first responders
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
who rely on and depend upon robust
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
reliable and redundant communications
 
00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:47.990 align:start position:0%
reliable and redundant communications
capabilities

00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
this would adversely infect new
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
construction designed to enhance
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
coverage throughout the state to include
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
land mobile radio or lmr and lte and
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
cellular network technologies and
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
networks it would also adversely impact
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
impact the future capabilities to
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
include leveraging the integration of
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
land mobile radio with cellular and lte
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
technologies for example push-to-talk
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
integration as well as land mobile radio
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
over the lte network these are all
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
capabilities that currently exist and
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
that are being used around the state
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
it would also impact and
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
adversely impact the fulfillment of the
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
governor's task force on school safety
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation that our division has
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
been charged with at the division of
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%

for overseeing the implementation of
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
those recommendations that have been put
 
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
those recommendations that have been put
forth

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
by the director of homeland security and

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
the governor to review and approve that
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation specifically speaks to
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
enhancing radio or cellular coverage for
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
emergency communications
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
including the placement of cell boosters
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
and antennas in and around and on top of
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
schools near school buildings to enhance
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%

responder perspective
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
we've also explored many opportunities
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
with regards to to leveraging available
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%

technology such as firstnet
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
this bill will constrain our ability to

have reliable and interoperable

new hampshire and are planning for the
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
next five years of expansion which
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
includes antenna placement on existing
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
and newly constructed towers for the
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
national public safety broadband network

currently and
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
intends to continue to provide

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
there are approximately right now in
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
this state about 200 agencies statewide
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
on that firstnet platform now with
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
thousands of individual firstnet
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
subscribers all reliant upon the
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
capabilities and interoperability that
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
firstnet provides
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
more of which will continue to enhance
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
and grow our ability to cont to continue
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
to provide and provision emergency
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
communications across the state to our
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
first responder partners this is also
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
going to potentially affect our ability
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
to have calls provisioned to the 9-1-1
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
call center as we oversee the 9-1-1
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
system in the state because about right
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
now 80 percent of our call volume in the
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
911 center is from existing cellular
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
networks and cellular service
 
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.670 align:start position:0%
networks and cellular service
subscribers

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
subscribers
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
about nine percent is based on landline
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
and that landline number continues to
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
drop while the number of cellular
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
subscribers and cellular call traffic to
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
the 911 center continues to increase
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
because of the topography associated
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
with the state of new hampshire most of
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a flat state we rely
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
explicitly especially when it comes to
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
wilderness response and for some of
 
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.390 align:start position:0%
wilderness response and for some of
those

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
less than
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
better served areas of the state where
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
cellular or broadband connectivity
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
exists we rely on the cellular networks
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
for folks to be able to reach out to us
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
to get the help that they need when they
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
need it so that the mission of the 911
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
center is accomplished to locate
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
communicate and connect people in an
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
emergency with the help that they need
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
by whatever technologies exist 30
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
seconds please
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
that pretty much wraps up what i had to
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
plan to speak to you relative to the
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
impact that this bill potentially would
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
have on our first responder community as
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
well as our ability to continue to
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
provide and leverage emergency
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
communications thank you mr chair thank
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
you mr doyle i expect that you'll
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
entertain questions i certainly will the
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative thomas
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
my question am i to understand that uh
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
your comments involving the spill
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
are they related to the
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
ambiguous wording referencing
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
towers in general
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
and and whatnot or are your comments
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
directly related to
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
whatever technology would be prevented
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
for proceeding to 5g capability
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and it's i
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a little bit of both it's
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
ambiguous to the degree that nobody's
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
really nailed down what the term
 
00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.270 align:start position:0%
really nailed down what the term
telecommunications

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
telecommunications
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
antenna mean it could
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
broadly be defined as radio
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
communications as well the technologies
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
that you speak to are important to kind
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
of consider as well because we're using
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
and i say we collectively at the
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
department of safety as well as the
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
first responders that are in your
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
communities right now are using a number
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
of technologies that include lte
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
coverage but also include the ability to
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
integrate lte and the radio
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
communication systems that they
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
currently use so that when we have gaps
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
in coverage in and around the state
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
we all know that radio isn't a perfect
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
solution and we all know that lte is in
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
a perfect solution when it comes to
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
communications because there are dead
 
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.950 align:start position:0%
communications because there are dead
spots

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
spots
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
however when your ability exists and we
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
currently have that ability right now
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
and it's being used in some sections of
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
the state to integrate the two it
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
broadly covers a large swath of areas
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't otherwise be served in
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
those underserved areas so to your point
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would impact their ability to
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
continue to use those resources and
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
expand upon them if in fact it went and
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
passed follow-up follow-up
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thanks for the
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up so in other words
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
if we were to if we were to just keep
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
the waiters right now that is using uh
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
what would be considered 4g technology
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
that there would
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
be gaps in the system that the 5g
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
technology would be able to fill
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
no i can't speak too too much
 
00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:49.910 align:start position:0%
no i can't speak too too much
to

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
what the coverage disparity if there is
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
between what the 4g cellular network
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
provides and what the 5g cellular
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
network can provide i can't speak to
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
this though
 
00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.349 align:start position:0%
this though
that

00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
the 5g network as i understand it
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
is used as
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
a technology to augment the ability to
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
provision a lot of data across the
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
cellular network we're using a lot of
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
voice but what first responders are
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
looking for right now is the ability to
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
get that data to them in the field the
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
5g signal as i understand it is able to
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
provision that data far more
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
expeditiously and far more efficiently
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
so that the first responders of the
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
community can get that versus the 4g
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
network that's currently out there thank
 
00:41:32.079 --> 00:41:32.870 align:start position:0%
network that's currently out there thank
you

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative plett is
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes you had written testimony you were
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
reading from i captured one tenth of
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
what you said could you submit that
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
please i have i've provided to
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative notter thank you
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
further questions for mr doyle
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
00:41:55.119 --> 00:41:56.230 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
question

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
doyle for taking my question
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
i was making notes as you were speaking
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned 200 agencies um
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
that are currently working with the
 
00:42:06.319 --> 00:42:07.349 align:start position:0%
that are currently working with the
first

00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
and thousands of um first net
 
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.710 align:start position:0%
and thousands of um first net
subscribers

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
subscribers
 
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.510 align:start position:0%
subscribers
so

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh i'm assuming your references to first
 
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.349 align:start position:0%
uh i'm assuming your references to first
responders

00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
responders
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
is is that what you're talking about
 
00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:17.670 align:start position:0%
is is that what you're talking about
there

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question let me
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
clarify when we talk about firstnet
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
firstnet is part of
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
the national public safety broadband
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
network initiative that was put forth
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
several years ago that every state has
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
opted in to use and when we talk about
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
the national public safety broadband
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
network it is exactly what that is
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
defined as it's a broadband network
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's designed specifically for public
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
safety and first responders to use in
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
times of crisis long story short it came
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
as a result of the nine
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh 911
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
commission that
 
00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:49.910 align:start position:0%
commission that
in

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
investigated what went wrong with a
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
multi-agency integrated response to a
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
disaster and the interoperability issues
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
and the log gm associated with
 
00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:00.160 align:start position:0%
communications networks during the
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
course of that response
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
again long story short they've come a
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
long way to recommend that what should
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
be in place is a dedicated
 
00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:08.470 align:start position:0%
be in place is a dedicated
pipeline

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
of communications availability of first
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
responders so that when the networks get
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
clogged that pipeline will continue to
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
exist when they decided that that was
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
going to happen the fcc awarded the
 
00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.349 align:start position:0%
going to happen the fcc awarded the
firstnet

00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
firstnet
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
project to att at t has that across the
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
country for all 50 states and the
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
territories that are on board with the
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
firstnet platform what they're designed
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
and been charged to do is over the next
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
few years in five-year increments is
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
work within the states and they're
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
working with our division to make sure
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
that the the scaling out
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
of that program and that project done in
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
such a way that it's going to meet
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
certain metrics that att has been had
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
their feet held to by uh the fcc when it
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
comes to the for that project now they
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't do it unilaterally they make this
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
decision based upon
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
coverage they based upon
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
geogeography they base it upon
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
population the number of first
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
responders in a particular state what
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
they've done with new hampshire though
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
is work very closely with the statewide
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
interoperability executive committee
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
in the state to identify where those
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
gaps exist so that first responders in
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
and around the state not just in the
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
rural areas and not just in the urban
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
areas have the ability to leverage
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
that communications platform that's been
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
going on for the better part of the last
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
five years and they're right now in the
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
second phase of that the plan for the
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
following five years which includes
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
building out on existing towers as well
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
as identifying areas within the state
 
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
that need that coverage because the
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
first responders have asked for it in
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
those areas that are currently
 
00:44:37.599 --> 00:44:38.710 align:start position:0%
those areas that are currently
underserved

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
underserved
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you before i recommend
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
the member for a follow-up could i ask
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
make your answers as succinct as
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
possible we have a limited amount of
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
time follow-up representative mcgee
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
the other question i had is we've
 
00:44:55.829 --> 00:44:55.839 align:start position:0%
received some notes from ham radio
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
operators and you mentioned radio
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
um i i don't really understand how that
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
is affected by this and i i i mean i
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
know what i read from what people ask
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
but i guess i would ask you
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
how you view that
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
they spoke to us in terms of the
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
security they might provide
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh in an in an event where something
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
went wrong they think that that's part
 
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
of their charge is having this extra
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
communication uh level
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't know a lot about that world
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
so i just wonder how that feeds into
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
this thank you for your question and
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'll try to constrain in such a way that
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
i'm staying within the timelines but
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
the ham radio amateur radio operators in
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
this state like they are in many other
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
states are partnering closely with
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
public safety and in new hampshire they
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
are part of what we call the emergency
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
services function esf ii when the state
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
emergency operations center is open in
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
the event that we need to utilize their
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
services because sometimes you may have
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
to have them come on board we've used
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
them during certain exercises to
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
leverage the ability for them to be able
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
to communicate on a different radio
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
network altogether and it may impact
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
them to based upon how the wording is is
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
defined whether they can erect or
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
construct new construction when it comes
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
to putting up their own antennas around
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
the state okay thank you representative
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
samsich is recognized for a question
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr doyle
 
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr doyle
um

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
i i understand from what you're saying
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
your concerns about
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
the lack of opportunities that may be
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
closed off by this bill
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh to some of the services
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
however right now you're already
 
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
providing these services without 5g so
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's not like
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
all these services couldn't happen
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
unless 5g is there
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill is focusing on some of the
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
claimed negative effects of 5g so a lot
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the people in new hampshire have some
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
concerns and worries
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
we should take those seriously
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's always a way working around
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
technology to give you the same result
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
as another question please yes so
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
so are you are are you
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
would you share the concerns that people
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
might have to know that before you
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
implement technology like this they need
 
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
to know that it's safe for them
 
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
i can speak to
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
when you spoke about 5g technology and
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
again i want to make sure that the
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
conversation i'm having with you is
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
framed in such a way that it's not
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
science specific that i've heard a lot
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
of testimony about the science and how
 
00:47:20.319 --> 00:47:21.589 align:start position:0%
of testimony about the science and how
5g

00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
5g
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
will or will not impact an individual or
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
affect an individual per se however i
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
can tell you this that we're utilizing
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
existing technologies now whether 5g
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
there is there or not those technologies
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
will continue to be using i don't know
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
if this bill restricts the placement or
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
erection or construction of antennas
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
because they're 5g or not or if it's all
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
or nothing
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts is
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
my my concern is that the bill that we
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
are contemplating
 
00:47:57.839 --> 00:47:58.630 align:start position:0%
are contemplating
is

00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
more or less on the proliferation of
 
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.910 align:start position:0%
more or less on the proliferation of
towers

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
towers
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
no matter what's connected to them
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
have some
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
expertise in the uh
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
interoperability situation because of
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
the sheriff's department
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
and our emergency
 
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.150 align:start position:0%
and our emergency
response

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
do you believe and uh that
 
00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
proliferation of towers small towers
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
within a small radius of each other or
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
large towers within a sm
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
small rate is
 
00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.549 align:start position:0%
small rate is
better

00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
for the service
 
00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.230 align:start position:0%
for the service
than

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
what i would consider fiber optics do
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
you believe that those towers
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
in close proximity to each other
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
and in close proximity to certain
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
sensitive places
 
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
would enhance
 
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.349 align:start position:0%
would enhance
our

00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
speed of
 
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
and and and eliminate the dead zones
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's a hard question to answer um
 
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:08.950 align:start position:0%
that's a hard question to answer um
because

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
i can wait on it
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
i'll give you the best answer that i can
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
i can tell you this that we when we
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
decide we and not only the department of
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
safety decide to look at areas in which
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
we need to provide coverage for our own
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
usage not for the individual communities
 
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
that are out there that are using radio
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
networks for their own purposes we look
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
at a number of things and we try to make
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
the best decision based upon available
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
technology as well as with the
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we have to build to
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
put it in place and sometimes that means
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
the availability of high-speed fiber
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
optic or does it make better sense to
 
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
put in a microwave system that actually
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
allows us to
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
get that radio communications up and
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
maybe quicker for less expense to
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
provide to our public safety officials
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
and officers that are out on the street
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to communicate back to us
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
it's it
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
really the answer is it depends depends
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
on a number of things including all the
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
things i just spoke to does that answer
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
may i respond go ahead and respond
 
00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.270 align:start position:0%
may i respond go ahead and respond
somewhat

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
but i i
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm concerned about the security of
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
some of these places having
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
had a flat tire in a dead zone in dover
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh years ago
 
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.030 align:start position:0%
uh years ago
what

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
what do you believe that a new system
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
and a new system of towers can do
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
that fiber optics cannot do
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
and do you believe it's essential
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
and that's a great question and that
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
that question i think i can't answer and
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for it
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
we live in a state that has
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of urban areas that are covered
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
with a lot of coverage whether it's
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
broadband whether it's fiber optic
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's cellular connectivity and
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
then we live in a state that has a vast
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
section of area geography wise that's
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
not covered with that because it's
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
impractical from a business standpoint
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
to lay out fiber optic throughout the
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
north country out in the western part of
 
00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
the state where it's just not practical
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
to do however when it comes to an
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
emergency response the emergency
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
response is not contingent upon
 
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:17.430 align:start position:0%
response is not contingent upon
whether

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
that should be in place or not it's
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
contingent upon whether it is in place
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
or not when we talk about cellular
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
connectivity and lte and radio we're
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
looking to cross that span of those
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
areas that don't have broadband
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
connectivity where people can't go to
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
the wall and pick up a phone or reach
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
for their cell phone and know they're
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
going to have a signal because they live
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the urban area of the state in those
 
00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:41.119 align:start position:0%
areas where we do a lot of wilderness
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
rescues and if you're paying attention
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
to the news you're seeing a lot of that
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
happen now
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
people are dependent upon that cellular
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
device that they have whether they
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
should be or not
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
they get stuck and then they're in a jam
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
on the side of a mountain someplace in
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
bad bad weather they want to know that
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
they've got a cellular connection it's
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
not going to happen everywhere but
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have fiber optic up
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
the side of a mountain to connect to
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
either okay mr doyle we really
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank you for
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
coming in this afternoon we've got six
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
more folks we want to hear from in the
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
next 40 minutes so i would like to call
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
now on
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
cecilia doucette of ashland
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and ms doucette
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to have three minutes
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i would remind you that we've
 
00:52:29.109 --> 00:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
already heard testimony about
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
the technology of 5g we've heard
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
testimony about
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
the potential health effects that some
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
people feel if you can add
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
new information to what we've already
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
been told that would be appreciated
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
so you have
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is cecilia ducette and
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
i am the director of massachusetts for
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
safe technology and the international
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
nonprofit wireless education
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
i helped ashland public schools in
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts become the first in the
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
nation to take precautions with wireless
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
technology i have also worked on several
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
bills in massachusetts and in other
 
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.829 align:start position:0%
bills in massachusetts and in other
states

00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
as a pandemic taught us we need to be
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
vigilant about invisible toxins
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
science indicates we should be at 0.1
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
microwatts per square meter in our
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
sleeping areas
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
and no more than 1 000 outdoors
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
this uh one cell phone that i'm going to
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
turn in first i'll give you an ambient
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
reading of just everybody's devices and
 
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
the wireless access points that are
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.839 --> 00:53:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
so i've just and the ambient was at 3
 
00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:50.069 align:start position:0%
so i've just and the ambient was at 3
700.

00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
700.
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
but look what happens now when i have
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
turned my cell phone on
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm not even doing anything this is
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
just a cell phone going here i am where
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
are you here i am where are you to the
 
00:54:01.589 --> 00:54:01.599 align:start position:0%
cell towers
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
and we are at 458
 
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.150 align:start position:0%
and we are at 458
000

00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
microwatts per square meter and we need
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
to be at 0.1 in our sleeping areas so
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
this is the gravity of what we are doing
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
indoors all we need to do
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
who knew you can buy a little adapter
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
hook up to an ethernet cable and you can
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
plug your cell phone in here to access
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
the internet twenty dollars for an
 
00:54:27.599 --> 00:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
the internet twenty dollars for an
adapter

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
adapter
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
when we allow any kind of close range
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
cell antennas or allow toxic utility
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
smart meters on our homes there is no
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
escape there is no sleep sanctuary and
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
the cumulative damage begins to mount
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's groundbreaking majority
 
00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.069 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's groundbreaking majority
report

00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
is from highly qualified
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
doctors scientists engineers and
 
00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
legislators they have documented for you
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
the science and the conflicts of
 
00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.069 align:start position:0%
the science and the conflicts of
interest

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
with our captured federal agencies this
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
is all in the report
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
the meat of the report is in the first
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
17 pages so if you haven't read it yet
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
you will get the summary and 15
 
00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations in those first 17 pages
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
i hope everybody has read this by now
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
in my earlier emails to you and
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
contributions to the subcommittee
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
meeting on january 31st 30 seconds i
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
debunked much of the disinformation
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
provided in the minority report that
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
starts on page 18.
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
we can have excellent technology and
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
close the digital divide but only with
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
future proof high speed cable or fiber
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
to and through the premises with
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
responsibly sighted
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
cellular microwave systems for
 
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.349 align:start position:0%
cellular microwave systems for
emergencies

00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
the fcc already i'm sorry the cdc
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
already has the alara principle which
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
means as low as reasonably achievable
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
and as dr swanson mentioned that's for
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
x-rays gamma rays in the sun we need to
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
apply alara now that we know just how
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
toxic microwave radiation is at the
 
00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.750 align:start position:0%
toxic microwave radiation is at the
non-thermal

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
non-thermal
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
level thank you thank you very much do
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
we have questions for ms doucette
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
representative white has a question
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you you uh mentioned 0.1
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
microwatts for sleeping locations what's
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
that based on that's based on this
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
compendium called the bio initiative
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
report which has
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
literally hundreds if not thousands of
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed published scientific
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
literature and it was done with 14
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
international experts who are experts in
 
00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:41.359 align:start position:0%
the biological effects we need to get
 
00:56:41.359 --> 00:56:42.150 align:start position:0%
the biological effects we need to get
away

00:56:42.150 --> 00:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
from listening to engineers
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
and physicists and technologists when we
 
00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.670 align:start position:0%
and physicists and technologists when we
set

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
biological safety limits we need to
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
listen to
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
the peer-reviewed independent science
 
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts is
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question i'm really
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
sorry that i'm i but i
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
is there any adverse effect
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
on medical equipment
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
from close proximity
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
to these microwaves i remember years ago
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
when microwave
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
ovens first came out big warnings all
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
over the place if you have a pacemaker
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't go near it um
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
i i just wondered if that has changed or
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
if there's more
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
data on that to your knowledge that has
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
not changed it is
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:38.710 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
so on medical equipment like
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
pacemakers oxygen tents
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
different things especially near
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals or in private homes
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
would it still perhaps have an effect
 
00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative knotter is recognized for
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
a question thank you mr chairman and
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question have
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
any 5g bills passed in massachusetts
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
we have not had a 5g bill passed in
 
00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.549 align:start position:0%
we have not had a 5g bill passed in
massachusetts

00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you okay miss doucet seeing no
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
further questions we thank you very much

00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
you hi there um i uniquely straddle both
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
the engineering side and the medical
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
side of this uh debate
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
as one of the leaders at northern
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
telecom building 2g back in the 1990s
 
00:58:58.950 --> 00:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
that resulted in almost all the base
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
stations for 2g in both the united
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
states and canada and as the creator of
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
the pop mednet system that is the
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
backbone for all distributed uh
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
epidemiology in the united states and 23
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
other countries so i am uniquely
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
qualified to talk about the statistics
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
and the probabilities of problems to do
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
with this and the engineering
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
consequences of this so
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
just to give an example right now people
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
have asked specific questions i think
 
00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's best of my time to actually answer
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
some questions what is 5g well 5g is
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
literally wi-fi 6. there's literally no
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
difference between wi-fi
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
with the latest version
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
and 5g there's none there are identical
 
00:59:42.559 --> 00:59:43.670 align:start position:0%
and 5g there's none there are identical
standards

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
there's no difference that's number one
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
number two 5g is 15 to 20 percent more
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
efficient than 4g over the same
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
frequency over the same megahertz it is
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
simply a more
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
efficient encoding standard
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
it is not in any way unique and these
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
waves are used everywhere in fact if you
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
take that device
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
and go and hold it over a cable
 
01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
and go and hold it over a cable
television

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
television
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
cable you will get exactly the same
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
interference with exactly the same
 
01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:14.789 align:start position:0%
interference with exactly the same
waveform

01:00:14.789 --> 01:00:14.799 align:start position:0%
waveform
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
as you do for 5g and wi-fi because they
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
both use exactly the same protocol all
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
three of them do
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay in fact if we hold that device in
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
front of an led light bulb you will get
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
similar rates of radiation if you hold
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
it near an electrical socket you'll get
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
similar rates of radiation
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
the key is is that it's different
 
01:00:35.589 --> 01:00:35.599 align:start position:0%
frequencies but the key with frequency
 
01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
is the higher the frequency the less it
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
goes through a wall in fact what the
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
community i believe is actually worried
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
about is what's called millimeter wave
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
it's high frequency
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
12 gigahertz to about 80 gigahertz well
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
if you've got a car that has collision
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
avoidance you're broadcasting all the
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
time at significantly high water higher
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
wattage than all millimeter wave
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
broadcast uh in 5g
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay if you have a television set you
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
are broadcast that is less than five
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
years old you're broadcasting at 60
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
hertz you 60 gigahertz using exactly the
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
same frequency if you
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
step outside and you enjoy the fact that
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
your weather forecast told you exactly
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
how the weather was 30 seconds you are
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
literally experiencing significantly
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
higher radiation on
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
significantly higher modulation from the
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
weather satellites that are broadcasting
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
down on you right now even sea band
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
which everybody's concerned about with
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
airports it literally was at thousands
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
of times more power with six foot
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
antennas in everybody's yards with
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
dishes and yet now we're talking 100
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
watts of power to give an example really
 
01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
quickly there's a wi-fi antenna right
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
there using exactly the same encoding as
 
01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.589 align:start position:0%
there using exactly the same encoding as
5g

01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
5g
 
01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
it right now
 
01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
is 42 negative 42 db okay and the lower
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
the number the worse it is my cell phone
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
on att right now
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
is negative 119 db that means that it's
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
about 17 times less powerful in this
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
room than the wi-fi that you're sitting
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
with okay using the same frequency
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you that's great information do we
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
have committee uh
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
mr hancock
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
a question thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
how

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
how do you account
 
01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
for the apparentness that there are
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
people that have testified
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
with having conditions
 
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.789 align:start position:0%
with having conditions
uh

01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
ver of various sorts that seem to be
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
living within certain radiuses of these
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
type of this type of technology have you
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
personally heard of any issues
 
01:02:51.430 --> 01:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
in your experience
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
yes and i'll i'll address it simply i
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
have celiac disease but celiac disease
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't actually a thing
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
until about 20 years ago
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
but did that mean that because we
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
discovered that celiac makes people
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
allergic to the proteins in wheat
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
does that mean that there was a massive
 
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.910 align:start position:0%
does that mean that there was a massive
increase

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
in people that had celiac disease no we
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
discovered it we created science to
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
actually monitor it and empirically
 
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
discover what was going on autism is
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
another perfect example we're constantly
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
told that autism is called caused by
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and yet with 95 percent
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
assured this a professional in autism
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
can diagnose a child with autism and i
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
know because my wife is one at 95
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
percent accuracy before their first
 
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.069 align:start position:0%
percent accuracy before their first
vaccination

01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
okay the key is is that we now think of
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
autism as an epidemic in this country
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
but what it actually is is that until
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
1990 we didn't actually have a solid
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
definition for autism nor did we have
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
the science to actually discover it so
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
we've gone and attributed
 
01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
we've gone and attributed
causation

01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
causation
 
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:00.559 align:start position:0%
to correlation caused by increased
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
testing we've even seen this with covet
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
19 we massively increased the testing in
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
the state and then breathlessly reported
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
that the number of cases is way up
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
did we prove anything no what we proved
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
is is that if you test more you'll get
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
more cases the exactly the same thing is
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
happening here so these events and i'm
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
not denying that they that they happen
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
and in fact i would absolutely guarantee
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
that there are people that are actually
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
susceptible to emf radiation but it's
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
not just cell phone radiation it's all
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
radiation which is everywhere
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
but we now know what it is and we have
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
ways to test for it and empirically
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
identify it so it appears to be have
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
become a much more significant problem
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
when it hasn't
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
we just know about it
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative samsich is
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
coming testifying and giving us a lot of
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
interesting information um can you tell
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
me if you are con
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
convinced that
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
the 5g technology is somehow essential
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
to what what we all
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from now with the all the
 
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.710 align:start position:0%
benefit from now with the all the
technologies

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh is there is there no other way around
 
01:05:15.359 --> 01:05:16.150 align:start position:0%
uh is there is there no other way around
this

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
the the needs that we have
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
so so you do you see that technology is
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
somehow essential to be installed so
 
01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's a two-part question first of all
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
yes we could all go and wire into plugs
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
in the walls
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
okay but the radiation of putting in all
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
those wells what's there 50 60 people in
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
this room okay so if we were to go and
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
wire everybody in this room every single
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
person would actually have to have an
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
ethernet cable and even though the
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
ethernet cables are insulated you just
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
put 50 to 60 more in every single room
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
that are broadcasting on exactly the
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
same technology as 5g on those wires
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
that's broadcasting out of the walls
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
you're literally going to make every
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
single wall filled with cables just as
 
01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
single wall filled with cables just as
bad

01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
bad
 
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay and realistically is everybody
 
01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to carry around a big 10-foot
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
cable in their pocket and plug in their
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
cell phone to go and use it
 
01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.230 align:start position:0%
cell phone to go and use it
no

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
so the choice is are you going to
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually do something like that and then
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
in the remote community the
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
in the community has made an example
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
with emergency services
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
the what's the first thing that burns
 
01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:22.230 align:start position:0%
the what's the first thing that burns
down

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
you you've got you've got a furnace in a
 
01:06:24.799 --> 01:06:25.750 align:start position:0%
you you've got you've got a furnace in a
school

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
which is probably the most likely
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
location for there to be a fire for
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
emergency services to have to respond to
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
well guess where they keep all of their
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
telecommunications equipment with their
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
their fiber optics their switches and
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
even all the ethernet that you want to
 
01:06:39.990 --> 01:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
go and walk around and plug your cell
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
phone in that you're gonna have the
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
emergency services well they're in the
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
utility room right beside the boiler
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
room so as soon as that fire happens
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
even if you could convince anybody that
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
emergency services could viably go and
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
plug in
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
to be able to get their data on site
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
it's not going to exist because it's the
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
first thing to burn
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay and i'll be just there's one more
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
point to this is that a tnt so so
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's a misconception with 5g that 5g
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
requires lte as well that's a temporary
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
situation in fact t-mobile is right now
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
actively rolling out 5g that does not
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
require lte
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
and a t even on the emergency services
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
network has said within the next three
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
years that the entire emergency service
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
network in the entire country is
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
transitioning to 5g and while that isn't
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
an issue right now in three years if new
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire was to pass this new hampshire
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
would be the only state that would be
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
massively underserved and the technology
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
would rot because all of a t's equipment
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
that it's purchasing would not be
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used in the state so our
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
technology would rot it would fall apart
 
01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
the technology won't be built because
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
there will be no customer for it
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
and as a result over time our emergency
 
01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
services network on lte will fail
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
so if we don't allow 5g then absolutely
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
emergency services will not have
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
wireless communication in this state
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
you mr hancock for coming in today
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
i this makes me pleased that we do have
 
01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.150 align:start position:0%
i this makes me pleased that we do have
engineers

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
engineers
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
the question that i have is at the
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
beginning of your testimony you
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned that 5g was wi-fi 6. and you
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
also mentioned that
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
that this technology is 15 to 20 percent
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
more efficient which is i assume why it
 
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
can handle more data
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh so that's the expectation is that it
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
would be worth
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
just to answer that so
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
so 5g is 15 to 20 more efficient per
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
megahertz okay of signal so my phone
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
right now has 10 megahertz
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
if i was to download a video off the
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
internet with 4g
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
and 5g in that same 10 megahertz it
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
would download 15 to 20 more quickly on
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
exactly the same thing with 5g than 4g
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
however 5g is solely being deployed in
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
new frequencies that the fcc has
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
released that are much much larger so as
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
an example t-mobile bought sprint
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
bought 150 megahertz
 
01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:14.319 align:start position:0%
of frequency and 2.5 gigahertz
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay versus which is four times larger
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
than all of the rest of the bandwidth
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
that they had in the state of new
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire so as a result they
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
immediately quadrupled the amount of
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
data that they can handle over over the
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
airwaves that they own but
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
there is no 4g
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
in that spectrum in the new c band the
 
01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
new 3.5 3.8 gigahertz and millimeter
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
wave we're talking orders of magnitude
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
as an example t-mobile has 800 megahertz
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
of millimeter wave frequency if you
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to cover
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
the mancha manchester uh stadium you
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
can't do it using regular traditional
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
frequencies because there's simply not
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
enough bandwidth
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
you have to use
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
ultra high ultra wide band
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
communications of which there's simply
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
no technology because new hampshire
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be the only one
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
that will actually work in those
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
frequencies using old lte or even 3g or
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
any other follow-up mr chairman
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
follow up so
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
all of that that you just said does that
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
mean bigger pipe yes much much bigger
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative callie
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
pitts you have a very quick question i
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's quick but it's i'm
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
confused because
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
when we heard testimony we heard that 5g
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
piggybacks 4g
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
and it sounded to me and it this is
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
marketing terms what you are saying
 
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.390 align:start position:0%
marketing terms what you are saying
is

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.110 align:start position:0%
is
and

01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
forgive me if i'm wrong and correct me
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
that if we don't roll out this 4g we're
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
all stuck without
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
self-service 5g there's 5g
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.830 align:start position:0%
 
prospect

01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
prospect
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
that i won't be able to pick up my phone
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
and call 9-1-1
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's true i don't believe
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
that that is the case so can you please
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
correct me to say that
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
if we don't use this particular service
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
who we don't know who manufacture it
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
matches it that maybe in five years
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
we're all gonna be stuck without service
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
everything in new hampshire is gonna rot
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
i thought that
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
my impression was that 5 4g
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
was still going to be operable so
 
01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
correct me
 
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:33.350 align:start position:0%
correct me
so

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
5g was rushed to market
 
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
as a
 
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
as a pitch
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
that should not have been released to
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
the market when it was released but
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
companies rushed it to market
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's why it required lte service to be
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
able to uplink back to the towers
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
however that's changing it's called
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's called nr or new radio
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
sa which is standalone 5g
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
is already being deployed right now by
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
t-mobile if you have a 5g phone in new
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire on t-mobile and it says 5g
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're solely broadcasting using 5g
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
technology at t verizon's new 5g network
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
it all is sa meaning standalone does not
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
require lte we know who the manufacturer
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
devices are but this is if you go and
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
draw a parallel we're still to this day
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
until very very recently using 2g for
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
voice and sms text messaging okay and
 
01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why we did this is because it
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
was vastly incompatible
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
except when lte came along for the first
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
time because 3g didn't even have voice
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
when lte came along we actually made it
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
all work like voiceover ip just like the
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
stuff that's used on a on most landlines
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
is voice over ip off of fiber optics
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
all of all of the cell phone companies
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
now if you have an lte signal your voice
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
is actually over that voice over ip well
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
the key is is that 5g
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
works with voice over ip exactly the
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
same way as lte and they're completely
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
interoperable so what will happen is
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
unlike the past where 2g stuck around
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to 5g
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
4g is not going to stick around for
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
decades and the reality of engineering
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
is is that the reason why things cost
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
what they do is because of mass
 
01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.270 align:start position:0%
what they do is because of mass
purchases

01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:21.280 align:start position:0%
purchases
 
01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
so if new hampshire is the only state
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
left and everybody else has gone to 5g
 
01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire can't
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
there isn't going to be a cost benefit
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
analysis to produce the minor number
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking thousands of units at most
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
instead of millions of units to be able
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
to maintain and replace 4g lte towers
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
with more 4g lte service because
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
literally everyone else will have gone
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
to 5g in fact the 5g consortium which
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
includes every single one of the cell
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
carriers in new hampshire expects that
 
01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
within the next seven years that lte
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
will be disconnected decommissioned so
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
instead of 20 to 30 years for 2g we're
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
talking five to seven years okay
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much mr hancock this
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
has been very good information i still
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
have four people who would like to
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
testify so i would like to
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
move along and call next
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
mr clark i'm going to give you three
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
minutes please thank you thank you very
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
much uh my name is terry clark and i'm a
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
county commissioner from cheshire county
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh i was a member of the keene city
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
council in 2019 when uh staff brought in
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
an ordinance to us that set guidelines
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
for installing small cell antennas in
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
the public right of way
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
and the problem the council faced was
 
01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.630 align:start position:0%
and the problem the council faced was
that

01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
the council couldn't really consider
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
health effects in determining the
 
01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
health effects in determining the
guidelines

01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
01:14:59.199 --> 01:15:00.070 align:start position:0%
guidelines
uh

01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
but the ordinance did include
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
non-binding preferences for location
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
standards but they were ignored when a
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
wireless company applied for licenses to
 
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
install these small cells in clustered
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
very close to elementary schools keene's
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
largest elementary school in fact
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
now i understand the federal
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
communications commission's a small sell
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
order which restricts what
 
01:15:26.070 --> 01:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities can require our providers
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
in my mind it simply failed the citizens
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
of keene by by not enabling the city
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
council to make rules protecting
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and schools
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill would would fix
 
01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.229 align:start position:0%
and i think this bill would would fix
that

01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
peer review studies uh have convinced me
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
that bombarding humans with high
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
frequency radio wave bandwidth is
 
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.070 align:start position:0%
frequency radio wave bandwidth is
harmful

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
harmful
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
as a background i served in an air
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
defense artillery unit in the early
 
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.590 align:start position:0%
defense artillery unit in the early
1970s

01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
1970s
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
and at the time there were discussions
 
01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
then about new technologies which
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
using high frequency radio waves could
 
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
not only disrupt
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
electrical systems and communications
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
equipment but could also heat human skin
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
levels uh immobilizing enemy soldiers
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
and they were talking about the
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
bandwidth of a millimeter wave which is
 
01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
between 30 gigahertz and 300 gigahertz
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
the range of 5g technology uses
 
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:20.950 align:start position:0%
the range of 5g technology uses
um

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
if we're going to use this kind of
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
technology well
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
let me just say that
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
my fear is is that we've gotten away
 
01:16:27.199 --> 01:16:28.070 align:start position:0%
my fear is is that we've gotten away
from

01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
discussing the health effects of this
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
technology with the emergence of a
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
communications industry probably
 
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
the the military uh at the time decided
 
01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
not to pursue this because
 
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
it violated many of the international
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
treaties that we had
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
for weapon systems and things and it was
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
discovered that it
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
shuts that thing wouldn't be humane way
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
to kill people
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
at the time i had a particular uh
 
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
grade level
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
and expertise in the area and uh uh
 
01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.430 align:start position:0%
and expertise in the area and uh uh
um

01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
30 seconds i can talk okay i could talk
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
more intelligently about it than i can
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
right now because
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
i've been out of the industry but
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
i agree with the state commission that
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
the fcc
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
based the small cell order on outdated
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
and incomplete findings i don't think
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
that we've really been talking about the
 
01:17:26.159 --> 01:17:27.110 align:start position:0%
that we've really been talking about the
safety

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
and health
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh of of this kind of technology just
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
because we have technology now
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
that we've been using we really don't
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
know the effect of what we're using
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
right now long-term effect on people now
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
this state which is proud of its home
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
root heritage home rule heritage needs
 
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that enables municipalities
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
to protect its citizens from sometimes
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
rash decisions that we get into that in
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
the past have all too frequently been
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
made in the interest of progress
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i really appreciate your
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
testimony are there questions um
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will call on the next
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
person who has signed up to testify
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
and that would be
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
russian or russian
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
committee members three minutes please
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely so i'm coming here
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
specifically as a citizen
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
but i do want to let you folks know that
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
i have experience with
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
this kind of situation when i worked for
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
a private
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
company that
 
01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.630 align:start position:0%
company that
handled

01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
handled
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
almost all of the weaponry for our
 
01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.669 align:start position:0%
almost all of the weaponry for our
military

01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
the 5g
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
resources that they had developed
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
so does phi is 5g a weapon i don't know
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
does it have the potential to be a
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
weapon absolutely
 
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
similar to nuclear power
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
nuclear power is supposedly extremely
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
safe but anytime we hear the word
 
01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.669 align:start position:0%
safe but anytime we hear the word
nuclear

01:19:11.669 --> 01:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
nuclear
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
we automatically think of the nuclear
 
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.470 align:start position:0%
we automatically think of the nuclear
bomb

01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
bomb
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
so i just want to bring that to your
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
attention more importantly as a
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
someone who
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
has traumatic brain injury
 
01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:23.990 align:start position:0%
has traumatic brain injury
i

01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
used to be
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
a cons
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
not a conspiracy theorist about the
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
tinfoil hats and all that kind of stuff
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i still don't know for sure if my
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury and my
 
01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:40.229 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury and my
sensitivity

01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
sensitivity
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
has increased because of that traumatic
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
brain injury and if it interacts with
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
radio waves what i do know that when i
 
01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.790 align:start position:0%
radio waves what i do know that when i
worked

01:19:48.790 --> 01:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
worked
 
01:19:50.950 --> 01:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
with children with traumatic brain
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
injury infant all the way up
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
um or or acquired brain injury um that
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
they could be asleep in the car
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
and we could go by a cell tower that was
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
very close and they would cry out
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
do i know why no
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
but has it happened on a number of
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
occasions absolutely
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i just want you folks to really
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
consider that when you're thinking about
 
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
something like this i've heard time and
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
time and time again we can't be left
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
behind the people of new hampshire want
 
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.189 align:start position:0%
behind the people of new hampshire want
it

01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
if they knew the potential consequences
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
would they really want it
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh any questions for miss jester
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will thank you for your
 
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.910 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will thank you for your
testimony

01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
and i will now call on the next person
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
the next two folks on our list are both
 
01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.590 align:start position:0%
the next two folks on our list are both
from

01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
out of state and the first is deborah
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
haven't we seen you before you don't
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
look like
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
i apologize deborah came to my house
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
last night and i'll explain what
 
01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.310 align:start position:0%
last night and i'll explain what
happened

01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
my name is deborah chandler i suffer
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
from microwave radiation syndrome after
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
i was here to testify on january 18th
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
but didn't get to speak it took me five
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
days to recover
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
from three hours of exposure in this
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
room from everyone's laptops tablets
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
smartphones wearables and that wi-fi
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
access point i could not take that risk
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
again so i have asked cc doucet to read
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
this statement on my behalf
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
please create an accommodation under the
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
americans with disabilities act so those
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
injured by wireless radiation can
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
testify remotely from the safety of our
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
own radiation free homes
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
subsequent to courtney gilardi and her
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
daughter amelia testifying before you
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago about the cell tower that
 
01:21:51.669 --> 01:21:51.679 align:start position:0%

applies only to the permitting process

not to what happens after the cell

towers are turned on

symptoms suffered when a cell tower goes
 
01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
up and you will see brain damage ears

01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
they have given to you
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
the pittsfield public health tragedy and
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
so many others like it could have been
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
prevented had there been a federal law
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
in place for bidding cell towers and
 
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
antennas at close range
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
there isn't though so it's up to our
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
states to ensure responsible technology
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
deployment new hampshire can still have
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
cell care coverage if you require
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
industry to site antennas away from the
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
public the phone signals can travel for
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
miles 30 seconds some may be tempted to
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
negotiate the 1 640 foot distance in
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 1644 but that is already half
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
of where the science still shows
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
increases in cancers neurological orders
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
and more
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
dr kent chamberlain who's with us today
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
and served on that commission provided
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
you each with a video to understand
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
these setbacks at the 10 minute mark
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
you'll see increased death rates start
 
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
to drop off at 500 meters or
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
1640 feet but there are still elevated
 
01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
risks up to nearly a thousand meters or
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
three thousand feet okay thank you
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's all we have time for i do have
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
one quick question for you do you know
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
of any epidemiological studies about
 
01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
this question yes in dr chamberlain's
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
presentation he is referencing the
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
epidemiological studies great thank you
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'll look that up okay okay any
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
ms uh
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
chandler's surrogate
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative christian
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chair for recognizing me thank
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so i took
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
a look through the bio initiative report
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i have to confess i found it a
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
hard to follow some of the
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
specific mechanisms that they were
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
proposing was causing these damages
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
could you talk a little bit more about
 
01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:33.830 align:start position:0%
could you talk a little bit more about
mechanism

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
so for a long time the industry could
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
spin it that well it must be fine
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any mechanisms of
 
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
harm identified that is no longer true
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
one of the mechanisms of harms occurs at
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
the voltage-gated calcium channels so
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
when we have this spike of radiation
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
hitting our biological cells at millions
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
of times in the gigahertz range or
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
billions of times or i'm sorry in the
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
megahertz range billions of times in the
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
gigahertz range it's doing this to our
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
cells that disrupts the voltage-gated
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
calcium channels it causes them
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
to have a chemical reaction outside the
 
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
cell wall that produces a really nasty
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
free radical called peroxynitrite peroxy
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
nitrite then will go into your body and
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
have a host of downstream effects for
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
you it might be breast cancer for you it
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
might be testicular cancer for you it
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
might be heart or brain
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
so wherever your body's weakest
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
proclivity is that's where we see harm
 
01:26:30.719 --> 01:26:31.990 align:start position:0%
proclivity is that's where we see harm
developing

01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
another mechanism of harm is called the
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
rouleaux effect
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
so when i was a kid i used to love those
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
candies called rolos that stack up
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's what happens when you magnetize
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
our red blood cells they should be
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
individually free floating and
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
oxygenating all of our biological cells
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
when you have
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
this magnetic field it's causing our red
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
blood cells to form the rouleaux effect
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
or this clumping and then that clump
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
can't get to where it needs to go
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
to bring oxygen to all of our systems at
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
the emf medical conference that was held
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
last january those courses are still
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
available today the doctors talked a lot
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
about that reload effect and they also
 
01:27:16.950 --> 01:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
talked a lot about
 
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
when you put up a cell tower outside
 
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's house or a smart meter on
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
their home that's where they see an
 
01:27:26.229 --> 01:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
increased patient load of people
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
suffering from microwave sickness so
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
those are only two of the effects there
 
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
are many more that we could discuss
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
infertility is a really big one too
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
all right we have one more person who
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
would like to testify so i would like to
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
call now on frank clegg

i've met with scientific experts from
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
around the world and conducted concluded
 
01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
wireless technology is not safe
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
i'm especially concerned with 5g and the
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
impact of wireless technologies on
 
01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.790 align:start position:0%

short term as your commission report
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
indicates though the ultimate goal is to
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%

01:28:57.510 --> 01:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
please know wireless technology is no
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
longer the preferred technology for
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%

the majority of communications
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%

company have already formed a new

alliance for fiber to the home as they
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
call it
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
fiber to the premises solves the
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
broadband equity issues finally closing
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
the digital divide
 
01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
the cost is not prohibitive wherever we
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
run electricity lines we can insert
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
fiber optics
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
properly cited cell towers carry signal
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
for miles and do not need to be located
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
near the populace the industry however
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
has a history of installing where it is
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
convenient and less costly for them
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
right on top of neighborhoods where the
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
electrical connections already exist
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
once we install fiber to and through the
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
premises and educate the public to
 
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
minimize toxic wireless connections 30
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
seconds the capacity demands for
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
wireless diminish and there is ample
 
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
capacity for cell phone calls on the go
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
investing in fibre to the premises for
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
primary connectivity will bring an
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
economic boon to new hampshire the
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
industry started as the cellular
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
telecommunications industry association
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
then they rebranded as ctia the wireless
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
association they're already preparing
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
their next revenue stream by buying into
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
the entertainment industry for streaming
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
services the industry will grumble but
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
they will pivot to provide superior
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
connectivity with fiber to and through
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
the premises okay thank you so much
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
since that's written testimony if you
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
could make sure mr clegg submits it to
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
the committee via email we would
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's been brought to my attention that
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
there is one other person who
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
wants to testify on this bill someone
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
who has driven all the way up here from
 
01:31:39.679 --> 01:31:41.669 align:start position:0%
who has driven all the way up here from
pennsylvania

01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
and so against my better judgment i'm
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
going to allow this person to testify
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
for three minutes
 
01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
so mr eric swanson i believe that's uh
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
how the name is pronounced you're
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
recognized to testify for three minutes
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
allowing me the three minutes
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
my name is eric swanson i've been asked
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
to talk to you about health effects of
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
this technology by ctia
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a professor of physics at the
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
university of pittsburgh i'm a member of
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
the union of concerned scientists and
 
01:32:17.350 --> 01:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm a fellow of the american physical
 
01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.790 align:start position:0%
i'm a fellow of the american physical
society

01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
the technology we're talking about is
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
non-ionizing radio waves non-ionizing
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
means that it is below what's called the
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
ionization threshold where
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic radiation has enough
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
energy to disrupt chemical processes
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
because this technology 5g in particular
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
is 30 000 times below that energy it has
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
no verified
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
effects on human body except for heating
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
because of this heating the fcc
 
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
regulates this technology the
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
regulations are extremely strict i won't
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
give you the numbers
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
i would like to point out that some of
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
the things you've heard are completely
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
wrong so please ask me questions
 
01:32:56.639 --> 01:32:57.669 align:start position:0%
wrong so please ask me questions
afterwards

01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
if you like
 
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
i won't give you numbers but let me give
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
you comparisons my brain is is a radio
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
transmitter i can explain why if you're
 
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.270 align:start position:0%
transmitter i can explain why if you're
interested

01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
interested
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
it violates fcc regulations by about a
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
factor of 10. the sun violates fcc
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
regulations by about a factor of 16.
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
my hot water bottle that i put on my
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
knee this morning because it was warm
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
violates fcc regulations by about a
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
factor of 50.
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
as you might gather from what i saying
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
these regulations are extremely strict
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
and protect us very well
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there because i know you're
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
short of time but i'm very happy to
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
mr swanson would love to hear your
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative the wiki is
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
recognized my question thank you mr
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you mr swanson for
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question one of the things
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
that i've been trying to get to is what
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
is the spectrum power and frequency and
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
i keep hearing different answers from
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
different people and so
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about uh cell
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
phones whether it's 5g or otherwise
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
we've got 800 1600 megahertz and so on
 
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth what amount of power do we
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
get at that how does that compare with
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
the ambient radiation from radio
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
stations right so so good question thank
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
you um you mentioned power and frequency
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
so frequencies are higher there they can
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
go up to 30 gigahertz they are typically
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
right now at one gigahertz that's a
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
factor of 30 higher so the higher one
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
remembers 30 000 times below the limit
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
um the power you don't get a definitive
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
answer that because there isn't one it
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
depends on the situation the the
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
companies are very proprietary about all
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
this they typically for 5g though are
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
very low compared to the 4g towers that
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
out there they will run at something
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
like 20 to 40 watts the towers would be
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
say 400 watts for comparison your laptop
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
further questions for mr swanson
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi is recognized
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh and thank you
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
professor um
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
so the bill that we have in front of us
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
limits uh
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
distance for these towers do you see
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
that as inhibiting
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
the proliferation of 5g technology
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
yes it does
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's also nonsensical
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you stand at the base of one of these
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
high power 4g towers you'll be at 1
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
1000th of the fcc limit which is very
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
strict if you limit the density of the
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
5g then you may as well not have 5g it's
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
designed to be low power and dense
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
that's the whole idea you get less
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
you know there's less immediate exposure
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
when you make it low power but you have
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
more of them
 
01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:48.470 align:start position:0%
more of them
follow-up

01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
so what would be your recommendation
 
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
then that the industry should seek for
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
its density how far apart should these
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
towers be
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
if we're talking about five yeah if
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 5g it's the sights
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
and they typically will be
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
it depends again on on details but
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
typically a block apart
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
again they're very low power to all of
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
our benefit higher more reliable
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
communication and less exposure
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative substance is recognized
 
01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chairman
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr swanson for coming to
 
01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the the main
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
incentive for the 5g deployment has to
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
do with
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
with business
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
please ask a question so don't make a
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
statement i
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
so yeah so i'm i don't don't understand
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
the reason behind it would be a health
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
effect i think
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree that the main
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
motivation for for this 5g rollout is
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
not health benefits but basically
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
business driven i'm i'm sure that the
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
main motivation is to is to provide
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
customers with the services they they
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
desire it's not so much about health yes
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
01:37:08.639 --> 01:37:09.990 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
question

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
quickly you mentioned the uh standing at
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
the base of a a cell tail which i have
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
never done
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
but what would happen
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
or what is the cumulative effect
 
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
of me
 
01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.830 align:start position:0%
of me
constantly

01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
walking by or living near a cell tower
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
and having it outside my door
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
i don't understand that correlation
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
there actually is no cumulative effect i
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
can explain this best with an analogy
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
say that i want to throw a rock across a
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
river the river's too wide i can't get
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
the rock across now i i'm stubborn so i
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
keep trying to throw the rock across the
 
01:37:47.679 --> 01:37:48.390 align:start position:0%
keep trying to throw the rock across the
river

01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
river
 
01:37:50.790 --> 01:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
am i going to get the rock across no
 
01:37:52.390 --> 01:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing happens with this there
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
is not enough energy in these 5g waves
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
to disrupt anything and it doesn't
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
matter how long you stand there it's
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
still not going to disrupt anything for
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
basically exactly the same river as i
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
said with the rock throwing so sorry the
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
same reason i said with the rock
 
01:38:06.159 --> 01:38:08.470 align:start position:0%
same reason i said with the rock
throwing

01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
throwing
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any uh further questions
 
01:38:11.199 --> 01:38:12.149 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any uh further questions
for

01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized thank
 
01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman okay so this
 
01:38:20.550 --> 01:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
my question is we just heard some
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
testimony again taking notes here
 
01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.870 align:start position:0%
testimony again taking notes here
um

01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
we just heard some testimony
 
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.109 align:start position:0%
we just heard some testimony
about

01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh bio effects basically
 
01:38:32.159 --> 01:38:35.350 align:start position:0%
uh bio effects basically
um

01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:40.149 align:start position:0%
 
voltage

01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
voltage
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
gated calcium channels being disrupted
 
01:38:43.679 --> 01:38:44.470 align:start position:0%
gated calcium channels being disrupted
and

01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
my notes are all over the place so i'm
 
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.270 align:start position:0%
my notes are all over the place so i'm
sorry

01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
and uh and the in the ruler effect so i
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know anything about
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
those things but i just wonder if you
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
have any impressions on that i'm i'm
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
happy to to give you a
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
sort of an overview of this stuff
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
i hear about this all the time it's all
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
wrong all of it and i want to explain
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
why this even exists
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
the medical industry standard for
 
01:39:12.149 --> 01:39:12.159 align:start position:0%
conducting a study is is to work at a
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
five percent false positive level it's
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
called alpha
 
01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
all medical studies
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
desire to have a five percent false
 
01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
positive level meaning that if you run a
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
hundred studies five of them are going
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
to find something that's the definition
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
of the false positive level
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
twenty five thousand studies have been
 
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
done estimated by the world health
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
organization five percent of that is
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
about a thousand about a thousand
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
studies are going to find something now
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
what do they find it's random remember
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
it's a false positive rate so they find
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
random stuff
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it's all over the map and the reason
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's all over the map and the reason you
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
get such a long laundry list of
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
disastrous things
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
is because it's random
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
when people focus on those thousand
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
studies the five percent they are
 
01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
ignoring the 95 percent of studies that
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
don't find any effect whatsoever it's of
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
course it's natural instinct of course
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
it just oh that agrees with my viewpoint
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
i'm going to pay attention to that and
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
ignore the 95 percent that disagree with
 
01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:10.229 align:start position:0%
ignore the 95 percent that disagree with
you

01:40:10.229 --> 01:40:10.239 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's what underpins all of this stuff
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
well

01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
this has been a very informative hour
 
01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:22.159 align:start position:0%
and seven minutes unfortunately it
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
cannot continue because we are committed
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
by schedule to
 
01:40:29.350 --> 01:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
open an exec session
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
open exec sessions on five early bills
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
so we're going to close the public
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 1644
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ask all spectators and
 
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
members of the minority party
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative pimentel would you
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
while representative pimentel is looking
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask all members of the
 
01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:01.990 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask all members of the
public

01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
and members of the minority party to
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
exit the room for
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
two minutes while we have a quick caucus
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
of the majority party
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman there are uh six names on

thank you okay
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%

your seats quietly i would like to

resume our
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
exec session
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i want to begin by apologizing to
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
everyone for the late start of this

executive session it was supposed to
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%

and i did my best to make that happen
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
but was unsuccessful

have caused anyone i personally feel
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
very strongly
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
that it's disrespectful for committee

meetings of this sort
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%

time that is valuable to them
 
01:47:04.870 --> 01:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
and the causes that they espouse
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
so my apologies for the late start

do you want to respond
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes i thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
yes basically even there were a lot of
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh good things that were mentioned
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
that the climate corps civilian chemical
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
group could do but after researching i
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
found that almost every single thing
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
that they recommended that would be
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
duties of this
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
commission are already being done by
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
existing groups such as the
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
so i viewed this to be a redundant
 
01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.149 align:start position:0%
so i viewed this to be a redundant
commission

01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
and i did not think it would be a wise
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
use of the taxpayers money so for that
 
01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:07.510 align:start position:0%
use of the taxpayers money so for that
reason

01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
i am recommending to itl thank you

activities that are currently conducted

thank you mr tim
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
well i would i would
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
say that i'd like to see us support this
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
we hear over and over again from state
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
agencies how they are out overstretched
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
they can't do all their job they need
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
more people
 
01:50:03.750 --> 01:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
to say that these functions are being
 
01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
done by state agencies right now
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
i would be shocked if that was actually
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
the case because it's certainly within
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
their domain to do it but i doubt very
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
much that much is being done in this
 
01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:16.550 align:start position:0%
much that much is being done in this
direction

01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
but the main thrust of this particular
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill was to energize and activate and
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
get people involved especially young
 
01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
people who feel strongly they want to
 
01:50:28.229 --> 01:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
contribute they want to volunteer to
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
their state and do something that they
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
feel strongly about
 
01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:32.629 align:start position:0%
feel strongly about
and

01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:35.510 --> 01:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is is not a costly bill it's
 
01:50:38.070 --> 01:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very simple bill it's all
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
about volunteerism and getting young
 
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
people and people interested in climate
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
issues and environment involved and to
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
say that we don't and this is not even
 
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
instituting that program it's just about
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
a committee who's going to study this
 
01:50:55.030 --> 01:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't see why we shouldn't be
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%

i
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
i too would
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
hope that we could support it because
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
we have an in testimony that i just
 
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
heard piecemeal efforts being done in
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
various state agencies and various
 
01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.629 align:start position:0%
various state agencies and various
businesses

01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i would think that it is
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
to have a comprehensive commission to
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
put all this together
 
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
and perhaps eliminate some of that
 
01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:28.550 align:start position:0%
and perhaps eliminate some of that
redundancy

01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
redundancy
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
way back
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
we had ccc
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
conservation corps
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
and they did marvelous work but they
 
01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:42.790 align:start position:0%
and they did marvelous work but they
mimicked

01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
mimicked
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
the work of other groups
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
so having something for young people and
 
01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:49.550 align:start position:0%
so having something for young people and
maybe

01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:51:53.350 --> 01:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
consolidating that effort at this time
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
would not be a bad idea
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
we are all stewards of the planet
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
every one of us whether we believe in
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
climate change or whether we don't
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
we are to be stewards
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're to take care of it and that that's
 
01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
what most of us believe
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that raising young people or
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
teaching young people that would be a
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
wonderful thing
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
and consolidating those efforts so that
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
more people would be aware of them
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
would be well worth it

01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
prospects
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
and most of us in fact and i think uh
 
01:53:14.229 --> 01:53:14.239 align:start position:0%
civilian conservation corps would be
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
a way for them to participate in
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
and actively and do something for their
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
own future which they probably
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
would be dying to do if they
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
gave we gave them half a chance thank
 
01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:30.709 align:start position:0%
gave we gave them half a chance thank
you

01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pementel is
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment thank you mr
 
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
some of the things mentioned was that a
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
lot of other agencies are doing
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
stuff about this well i contend that
 
01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:47.030 align:start position:0%
stuff about this well i contend that
this

01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
advisory commission is a place where we
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
can bring together the des and the
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
department of
 
01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.510 align:start position:0%
department of
energy

01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
and department of education
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
and a lot of non-profits
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
that are in the state
 
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
work out
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
how this com how this
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh civilian climate core
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
could work
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
not a penny would be spent until
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
after they come up with a pro with a
 
01:54:19.679 --> 01:54:20.790 align:start position:0%
after they come up with a pro with a
program

01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
and at that point it would go to the
 
01:54:22.639 --> 01:54:24.070 align:start position:0%
and at that point it would go to the
legislature

01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
as a bill to actually establish this
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
core so i think that
 
01:54:29.599 --> 01:54:30.390 align:start position:0%
core so i think that
uh

01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:32.229 align:start position:0%
uh
basically

01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
putting the knicks to this this this
 
01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:36.070 align:start position:0%
putting the knicks to this this this
early

01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
early
 
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
is not a good idea and i'm going to be
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized for
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
a comment thank you mr chair mr chair
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
i do believe this is a good endeavor but
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
like other good endeavors i don't see a
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
need for why the state would have to get
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
involved and establish a commission
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of organizations out
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
there that are done by
 
01:54:59.599 --> 01:55:01.030 align:start position:0%
there that are done by
volunteers

01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
organized organizations formed as
 
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
non-profits they all do good deeds i
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
don't see why a private organization
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
of any sort could not be established
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
without you know this
 
01:55:16.629 --> 01:55:16.639 align:start position:0%
this bill to accomplish the same needs i
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
i just don't see why the state should be
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
getting involved with this i mean even
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
you can substitute this for saying we
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
should have a commission on how we can
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
get involved with sports in the state
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
you know yet we have numerous
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
non-profit volunteer state associations
 
01:55:33.830 --> 01:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
that are being run without the state's
 
01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:34.709 align:start position:0%
that are being run without the state's
help

01:55:34.709 --> 01:55:34.719 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
so i don't think this bill is necessary
 
01:55:39.589 --> 01:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
i think the idea is fair for people that
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
want to get involved with us and they
 
01:55:43.990 --> 01:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
should form something but i don't think
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is the right way to go i'll be
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
voting against it
 
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the wiki is
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment thank you mr
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
chairman representative thomas stole my
 
01:55:55.510 --> 01:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
thunder that was exactly what i was
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
saying if it's a good idea then why
 
01:56:00.149 --> 01:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
can't it be voluntary
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
christian has a comment
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um so my understanding of the
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
bill is that you know it's meant to
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
serve as a place for government to bring
 
01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:16.149 align:start position:0%
serve as a place for government to bring
together

01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:56:16.159 --> 01:56:17.430 align:start position:0%
together
um

01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of volunteer organizations
 
01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
and nonprofit organizations that are
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
going to be part of this but part of it
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
is also the idea that there will be um
 
01:56:29.830 --> 01:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know some government federal money
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh coming in for these sorts of things
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
um so just speaking as a younger person
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
in the legislature i guess um
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know when i look around at things
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
that we've done in this country
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
historically things that were built by
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
the wpa and the ccc and still last today
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
it's really powerful that idea that we
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
can build things that last for a really
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
long time when we work together
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
and going back to what representative
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
mann said earlier
 
01:56:56.310 --> 01:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know we think about young people
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
today feel so alienated from their
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
community maybe this is a great way that
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
we can bring together
 
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
people from young people from all over
 
01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
to work together build something
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
together and hopefully have a more civil
 
01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:09.030 align:start position:0%
together and hopefully have a more civil
discourse

01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
discourse
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
along all kinds of
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
topics so thank you
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative creation
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
since you mentioned it i will also
 
01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
mention that the civilian conservation
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
corps back in the 1930s was formed was
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
created by the government in a time when
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
there was 25 percent or more
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh unemployed
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment in our country today we
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
have the opposite problem we have more
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
jobs and we have people to fill them
 
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
further comments on this uh
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative man has another comment
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
in contrast to the idea why can't people
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
just do it on their own i think the um
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
what what the civilian core could do is
 
01:57:56.229 --> 01:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
provide organization
 
01:57:59.910 --> 01:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
and resources you're doing work in
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
terms of energy efficiency so and so on
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
and improving our
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
prospects in terms of climate change it
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
will take resources
 
01:58:14.310 --> 01:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
far beyond what
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
i think individuals can
 
01:58:18.629 --> 01:58:18.639 align:start position:0%
find in their pockets
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker mr chairman
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative man
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative samsic is recognized
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:58:28.639 --> 01:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm old enough to remember when this
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
country still had a draft and when the
 
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
draft was abolished
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
and when people no longer were forced
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
to provide service to the government
 
01:58:42.719 --> 01:58:45.430 align:start position:0%
to provide service to the government
military-wise

01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
military-wise
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of things
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
dropped off the edge
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
people felt oh i don't have to do
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
anything for my country anymore you know
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
no more draft
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
but in fact
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
there was still the peace corps
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
and if you remember what the peace corps
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
had as an impact first of all it was
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
mainly young people that joined and
 
01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
secondly it projected a vision of
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
america and
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
a portrait of america to the rest of the
 
01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:13.750 align:start position:0%
a portrait of america to the rest of the
world

01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
world
 
01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
that positive impression
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
lasted many many decades after after it
 
01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
started to dwindle and now has become
 
01:59:23.669 --> 01:59:23.679 align:start position:0%
more something that seniors do instead
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
of young people do
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
i personally always felt that there
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be some kind of mandatory
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
national service in this country for
 
01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:32.790 align:start position:0%
national service in this country for
everybody

01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
so that everybody should do something in
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
service of their country whether it's
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
peace corps or a military or
 
01:59:39.599 --> 01:59:40.870 align:start position:0%
peace corps or a military or
something

01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:41.910 align:start position:0%
something
similar

01:59:41.910 --> 01:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
similar
 
01:59:44.070 --> 01:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
i think citizens have to have some
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
obligations and right now they don't
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
they take it for granted that somebody
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
else will do this for them
 
01:59:52.229 --> 01:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
this is an opportunity to do something
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
that might energize
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
young people and energize other people
 
01:59:58.550 --> 01:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
to say i'd like to do something when it
 
02:00:00.709 --> 02:00:00.719 align:start position:0%
comes to the climate or energy
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
efficiency or the environment
 
02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
efficiency or the environment
and

02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
government needs to be there to help
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
organize something like this it might
 
02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
turn out to be very inexpensive after
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
all uh peace corps workers were pretty
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
cheap too back then so i think for those
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
reasons we really should consider
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
encouraging these things and not
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
discouraging them thank you
 
02:00:24.070 --> 02:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative notter is recognized
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have an example
 
02:00:28.629 --> 02:00:28.639 align:start position:0%
of the community coming together without
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
the government sticking their nose in it
 
02:00:32.470 --> 02:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the town of merrimack a few years
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
back the rotary club organized a
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
rebuilding twin bridge park and it was
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
just a vast array of people old people
 
02:00:42.550 --> 02:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
grandparents parents and young people as
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
well all working together they
 
02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
renovated kids cove that's what we call
 
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
twin bridge park and it's really nice
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
and the government had nothing to do
 
02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
with it and it worked well
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
i have two observations and i'll go to
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
the last one first representative notter
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
what if i wanted to help rebuild a park
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
in your community i would not have known
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
anything about it so that consolidation
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
and a place to go the other piece of
 
02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:14.790 align:start position:0%
and a place to go the other piece of
information

02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
that i would like to
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
correct and i'm looking at
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
representative thomas and i hate to do
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
that but the government has stuck its
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
nose in sports
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
and it's only certain sports and i do
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
believe we have a commissioner of a
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
certain sport in this state
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
which is boxing
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank thank you mr chair um
 
02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:41.350 align:start position:0%
thank thank you mr chair um
uh

02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to go back to previous comments
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
made by representative samsich i agree
 
02:01:48.070 --> 02:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
with you uh young people should take
 
02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
with you uh young people should take
responsibility

02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
i do remember what time was the draft uh
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
based on your comments maybe the federal
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
government should reinstate the draft
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
to have people uh to do work for their
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
country but i think it would be best
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
served that if this was
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
that idea that you're speaking of
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps it should be the federal
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
government that establishes something
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
and not just a patchwork of state by
 
02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:12.390 align:start position:0%
and not just a patchwork of state by
state

02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i would think that new hampshire
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
should perhaps if this is that important
 
02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
should wait and see if the federal
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
government would like to establish a
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
national program in which the state
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
could perhaps join in as a state
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
association on something like that so
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's my comments on that and by the way
 
02:02:31.599 --> 02:02:32.870 align:start position:0%
it's my comments on that and by the way
yes

02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:02:34.950 --> 02:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
boxing does have a commissioner
 
02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:37.750 align:start position:0%
boxing does have a commissioner
but

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
soccer does not i don't know why but we
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
do quite well here in the state have our
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
own private association on that one so
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:47.189 --> 02:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mirner is
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment thank you
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
chairman um in the 70s late 70s we had a
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
similar program in this country because
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
we had very high unemployment
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
and being in the construction trades we
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
we created the cedar program
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
again it was based on employment you
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
know the government did fund it and we
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
amazing amount of stuff got done back
 
02:03:08.639 --> 02:03:09.589 align:start position:0%
amazing amount of stuff got done back
then

02:03:09.589 --> 02:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:03:11.430 --> 02:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
because back then we were at 11
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment for a couple of years right
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
now we have no unemployment to chairman
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
fose's point so i can't see how this
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
program would work i think we'd be
 
02:03:21.199 --> 02:03:22.470 align:start position:0%
program would work i think we'd be
throwing

02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
throwing
 
02:03:23.750 --> 02:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
into something that's just not
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to point out that the
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
federal funds under the american rescue
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
plan are cited in the fiscal note those
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
would not be available to voluntary
 
02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.350 align:start position:0%
would not be available to voluntary
organizations

02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
or to rotary organizations
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
secondly we have a demographic crisis in
 
02:03:53.669 --> 02:03:53.679 align:start position:0%
this state we're losing our young people
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
we're losing them to better
 
02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities elsewhere and because of
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
despair but what i hear and what i
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
received in letters about this were from
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
people who can't sleep at night
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
i've had nightmares about climate crisis
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
and having taking action is the best
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
antidote to despair and apathy and i
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
think the government has a role here we
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
have the funding to do it that we're in
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
an unusual situation with funding and
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
this could be something the commission
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to last forever but it's
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
four meetings a year
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
but you know for a couple of years i
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a worthwhile endeavor
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
and could have very positive
 
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
ramifications for bringing young people
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
to the state for retaining people who we
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
are losing because people don't see
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
opportunities here
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you we might retain more of our
 
02:04:50.229 --> 02:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
young people if we
 
02:04:52.229 --> 02:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
built more affordable housing here in
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
so do i
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
i was supposed to testify on it this
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
morning but municipal and county
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
government was so far behind i never got
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
to it so
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
now i have to come back wednesday i
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
might also point out that the
 
02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:10.229 align:start position:0%
might also point out that the
climate

02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
climate
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
civilian climate corps that's mentioned
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
was originally envisioned as being part
 
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the buildback better plan which has
 
02:05:22.950 --> 02:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
now apparently died in congress
 
02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:23.910 align:start position:0%
now apparently died in congress
so

02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
there may not be a
 
02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:27.109 align:start position:0%
there may not be a
a

02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
federal or nationwide civilian climate
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
corps in the near future
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
therefore i would think it would be
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
premature to start a commission to
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
advise such a climate corps if it
 
02:05:41.669 --> 02:05:41.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no further comments on
 
02:05:45.589 --> 02:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
this issue i think i would like to ask
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role on the motion
 
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:50.920 align:start position:0%

this was a bill that i prime sponsored
um

02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
to focus on
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
creating a fund that could be revolving
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
to focus on new and uh
 
02:09:33.189 --> 02:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
nascent energy projects in the state of
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
um i'd love to have some more discussion
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
on it i i did present an amendment uh i
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if everyone's had an
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at it but they've
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
been handed out and if you don't have
 
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
one let me know i have a stack over here
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
of extra
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
1506 amendments basically it takes the
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
base bill and just amends a couple of
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
the sections that we discussed during
 
02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that could be a problem to
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
iron out some of the issues
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
including addressing um
 
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and low-income communities uh
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
putting in some enabling language so the
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
department of energy would actually have
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
the ability to farm out through the
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
request for proposals process management
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
for banks um
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
to manage the funds rather than the
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
department of energy managing funds
 
02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
and also making sure that this
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
can actually sustain with financing fees
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
over the long term
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
but for the for for the short term the
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
intention was that
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
these funds would be used to pay for
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
staff at the department of energy at
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
least until things get going so more
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
enabling language there
 
02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:37.589 align:start position:0%
enabling language there
but

02:10:37.589 --> 02:10:37.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
as we discussed at the public hearing
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
really the intent here is for this bill
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
to be a bucket
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
to create a bucket of funds so that we
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
can look to the future of energy in the
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and so i'm
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
disappointed to see an itl
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation right out the gate and
 
02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to understand a little bit more
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
about other concerns with this concept
 
02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to have a discussion about
 
02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.709 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to have a discussion about
that

02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:00.719 --> 02:11:01.669 align:start position:0%
that
okay

02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
would anyone like to uh
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative lewicky has a comment
 
02:11:09.030 --> 02:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
hb 1506 would duplicate many programs
 
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
that are already in existence both
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
public and private
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
these existing programs in both include
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
both government and commercial
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
the if by it would make the gov
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
government of new hampshire the investor
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
of last resort after everybody else has
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
refused these programs
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
the it would impose mandates and costs
 
02:11:31.669 --> 02:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
on the department of energy which are
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
not addressed
 
02:11:33.119 --> 02:11:33.910 align:start position:0%
not addressed
and

02:11:33.910 --> 02:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
which the department of energy
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
apparently does not wish to undertake
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
and the final one which may have been
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
taken out in the amendment which i
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
haven't seen would be the explicit
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
racial discrimination on page 3 lines 10
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
through 12. that was removed would you
 
02:11:51.189 --> 02:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion on uh house bill
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
1506 and the motion to itl
 
02:11:59.189 --> 02:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
is something that as the fiscal note
 
02:12:08.709 --> 02:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
mentions is often referred to in other
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
states as setting up a green bank
 
02:12:14.149 --> 02:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
and it's been done in many places and
 
02:12:17.830 --> 02:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
the idea is we we can have a revolving
 
02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:18.950 align:start position:0%
the idea is we we can have a revolving
fund

02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.790 align:start position:0%
fund
to

02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
help fund various projects that have to
 
02:12:27.430 --> 02:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
do with energy efficiency or
 
02:12:29.669 --> 02:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
energy projects and so forth
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
and it would be self-sustaining
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
essentially when it's a revolving fund
 
02:12:36.870 --> 02:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
you you basically give out the loan and
 
02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
you get the money back
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
and it would be funded by various
 
02:12:43.270 --> 02:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
sources federal state and organizations
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
all over the country who are currently
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
actually putting money into such funds
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
to encourage
 
02:12:50.079 --> 02:12:50.870 align:start position:0%
to encourage
more

02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:52.470 align:start position:0%
more
more

02:12:52.470 --> 02:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
projects of this nature
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
including many corporations that are
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
doing it because they want to make a
 
02:13:00.629 --> 02:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
statement about their particular company
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
so i think this is this is a worthwhile
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
effort and uh
 
02:13:05.199 --> 02:13:06.149 align:start position:0%
effort and uh
if

02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:13:07.750 --> 02:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't think there's much of an
 
02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
effort going on right now in our state
 
02:13:11.109 --> 02:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
we we have to start somewhere and we
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
have to start by having a fiscally
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
responsible way of funding projects like
 
02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:19.830 align:start position:0%
responsible way of funding projects like
this

02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's always surprising how many people
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
in other states once you have a fund
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
like this how many organizations
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
companies and others step forward to say
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to put some money into that i
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
think that's a good investment for my
 
02:13:34.629 --> 02:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
future and my children's future
 
02:13:36.550 --> 02:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion on house
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
bill 1506
 
02:13:43.189 --> 02:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
comment thank you mr chairman yeah i
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
think i'd like to just reiterate i i'm
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
always happy when i see folks come up
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
with you know creative ideas that have
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
worked in other places for us to
 
02:13:55.119 --> 02:13:56.229 align:start position:0%
worked in other places for us to
consider

02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:13:56.239 --> 02:13:57.270 align:start position:0%
consider
and

02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
i actually really like this bill because
 
02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
i think uh the concept of the bucket
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh is to say that if we don't have a
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
bucket no one's going to be putting
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
anything in the bucket but if we
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
if we enable
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh a place for green funds to be
 
02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.069 align:start position:0%
uh a place for green funds to be
collected

02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
collected
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
then it it could end up being a force
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
multiplier in a very positive way for
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
finding supports for things that we
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to fund through other means
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
so if we don't want to fund things
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
through rate payers
 
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
and we have exceptions to those types of
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
programs and then we look at
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
this which is offering us an alternative
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
which is saying
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to allow people who have
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
funds and have interest in this to be
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
able to donate their money here and let
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
us put it to work for them
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's a really worthwhile idea
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
and i just i want to thank you for
 
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
bringing it
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
i have heard of green banks before but i
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire hasn't done anything
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
like this before so i
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
i just commend you for bringing it and i
 
02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
i hope that folks will consider it more
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
strongly than to just say we've decided
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's going to be inexpedient to
 
02:15:07.189 --> 02:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
legislate because this is this is the
 
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
kind of idea that we should probably be
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
coming together across party lines to
 
02:15:11.199 --> 02:15:12.550 align:start position:0%
coming together across party lines to
support

02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cost anybody anything
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
and it gets us where we would like to be
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
which is having money available for
 
02:15:20.470 --> 02:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
people to do things that will benefit
 
02:15:20.480 --> 02:15:21.589 align:start position:0%
people to do things that will benefit
everybody

02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernard is
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
recognized for a comment
 
02:15:29.669 --> 02:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
so this idea to me is perfect as a
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
private nonprofit enterprise not as a
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
government-run organization
 
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i commend you to things like tunnel
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
for towers or habitat for humanity these
 
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
are organizations that
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
have a slightly different tilt than what
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're looking at but the concept is
 
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
there and it demonstrates that private
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
non-profits can clearly do
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that you're looking to
 
02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:02.709 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that you're looking to
accomplish

02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative mick
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
williams do you have another comment you
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make
 
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to reiterate that there
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
is no state funds at all in this bill
 
02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:15.270 align:start position:0%
this is
completely

02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:16:17.350 --> 02:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
volunteer donations
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
and if available federal funds this is
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
not a state funded this is not about our
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or even ratepayer dollars
 
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you now that you mentioned that i
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
would point out that the fiscal note
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
with this bill suggested that a source
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
of funding for this green bank could be
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
american rescue plan funds but i would
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that those are one-time
 
02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:41.349 align:start position:0%
remind everyone that those are one-time
funds

02:16:41.349 --> 02:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
and even if there were some allocated to
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
this green bank
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
it would need to get other
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
money from somewhere else at
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
in the future in order to sustain itself
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:16:57.200 --> 02:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
yes

02:16:58.070 --> 02:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
the one-time funds are helpful to set up
 
02:17:04.070 --> 02:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
the fund so it's not looking for ongoing
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
funds although who knows what the feds
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
may come up with in the future if you
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
look at the top of page four
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
it says outright that this is looking to
 
02:17:14.950 --> 02:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
partner with private capital providers
 
02:17:16.629 --> 02:17:16.639 align:start position:0%
and capital markets to attract
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
co-investment from private banks
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
community development financial
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
institutions investors and others in
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
order to drive new investment into under
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
penetrated markets to increase the
 
02:17:30.790 --> 02:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
efficiency of private capital markets
 
02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to investing in greenhouse
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
gas production projects and to increase
 
02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
total investment from the fund and then
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
it specifies underneath of that this is
 
02:17:42.549 --> 02:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
not something a private organization
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
like habitat for humanity is capable of
 
02:17:46.469 --> 02:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
doing you know this is something that
 
02:17:49.190 --> 02:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be audited it needs to be
 
02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
financially secure it needs to be
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
vetted by
 
02:17:56.309 --> 02:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
the banks and also by the federal
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
funders so yes i think the you know the
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
idea here is is a good one and it is
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
certainly not duplicative of anything
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
that is currently going on in new
 
02:18:06.399 --> 02:18:07.349 align:start position:0%
that is currently going on in new
hampshire

02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
and it would bring funding to
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
under-resourced areas that currently do
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
not receive funding because there's not
 
02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
the security for the capital
 
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
private investment to
 
02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
reference representative bernardi's
 
02:18:20.479 --> 02:18:21.429 align:start position:0%
reference representative bernardi's
point

02:18:21.429 --> 02:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's perfectly possible for private
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
investors to do this at this at this
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
moment but they don't have the security
 
02:18:28.709 --> 02:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
to do it this would be a secure
 
02:18:28.719 --> 02:18:30.230 align:start position:0%
to do it this would be a secure
mechanism

02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it's it's uh we should
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
support it thank you
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
you had a question a comment to make did
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
you not
 
02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
i did and i guess i i felt that
 
02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
this type of funding for a long time i
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
thought would be
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
excellent for this revolving fund for
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
low income housing or medium income
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
housing which you
 
02:18:55.599 --> 02:18:56.950 align:start position:0%
housing which you
mentioned

02:18:56.950 --> 02:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
i also believe that this bill
 
02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:01.509 align:start position:0%
i also believe that this bill
probably

02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:19:04.790 --> 02:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time and i hate to say
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
that but i i don't think it is
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
and i think it deserves more attention
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
and more study either in this committee
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
or in another committee and i know and
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
because i say things like a loose cannon
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
it's election year and it's hard
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
to get people to want to study things
 
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
but i think the time has come
 
02:19:29.830 --> 02:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
arpa money is available we need seed
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
money is what we used to call it in the
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
old days we need seed money it's like
 
02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
priming the well you got to put water in
 
02:19:38.230 --> 02:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
it sometimes to get it out
 
02:19:40.070 --> 02:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that this is
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
is not quite ready
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
to become an rsa
 
02:19:46.790 --> 02:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
but i think it's not quite ready
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
to die
 
02:19:50.710 --> 02:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh any further comments
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
i'd remind all members that
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
there were similar programs that have
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
been created in the past the first one
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind is the pace program
 
02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:05.510 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind is the pace program
that

02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
attempted to do very similar things as
 
02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
and that program has
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
been wrought with
 
02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:14.870 align:start position:0%
been wrought with
fraud

02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
fraud
 
02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:17.030 align:start position:0%
fraud
with

02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:18.550 align:start position:0%
with
manipulation

02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
manipulation
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
with financial
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
problems and has not delivered on its
 
02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:25.030 align:start position:0%
problems and has not delivered on its
promises

02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
promises
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that i would be
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
reluctant to go forward with the program
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
such as this one without a more robust
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
description of how it would
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
operate how it would be overseen and how
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
it would be funded
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts did you have
 
02:20:43.429 --> 02:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
a response to that the response i had
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
was simply that this
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
this to me is one of the reasons that it
 
02:20:47.680 --> 02:20:48.870 align:start position:0%
this to me is one of the reasons that it
needs

02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
a program like this one needs more study
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
but needs more state controls than what
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
we can have than what we can put on it
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
that we can audit that we can that we
 
02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
can make sure the money goes where it's
 
02:21:02.469 --> 02:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
02:21:02.479 --> 02:21:03.670 align:start position:0%
supposed to
and

02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
if it was a private totally private
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
thing we wouldn't have that control so i
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
think that that's just proves
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
to me the proof is in the pudding that
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
that we would need
 
02:21:20.070 --> 02:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
to have it as a state control program
 
02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:21.510 align:start position:0%
to have it as a state control program
representative

02:21:21.510 --> 02:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
thompson you have another comment thank
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman just a quick one it
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
seems to me under the circumstances
 
02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
right now where we're trying to define
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
what exactly the department of energy is
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to do or not do
 
02:21:36.150 --> 02:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of program it should be
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
doing in all kinds of areas so
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that's worth keeping
 
02:21:42.630 --> 02:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
in mind that just because we don't have
 
02:21:44.389 --> 02:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
it now doesn't mean we won't have
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
anything like this in the future
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that comment
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%

uh as i mentioned in my testimony on
 
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt to try to ensure that
 
02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:42.950 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt to try to ensure that
the

02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
revenues from
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
the reggie allowances that the state
 
02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:50.150 align:start position:0%
the reggie allowances that the state
gets

02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
gets
 
02:25:52.710 --> 02:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
be at least at a certain floor level and
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
never go down
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh we had a uh testimony by uh puc
 
02:25:59.750 --> 02:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
chairman chairwoman dianne martin
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
telling us uh recently that
 
02:26:06.389 --> 02:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
the reggie allowance prices are expected
 
02:26:07.590 --> 02:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
to rise
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
and as they rise
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if we could benefit
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
from that both in the portion that is
 
02:26:16.790 --> 02:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
invested in energy efficiency which was
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
the goal of reggie
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
as well as money that goes back to uh
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
as rebates to the customers so when the
 
02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
reggie allowances go back go up
 
02:26:29.670 --> 02:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
everybody would benefit however if we
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
don't change the the formula that we
 
02:26:34.070 --> 02:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
have right now which is just one dollar
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
of the allowance no matter what the
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
price of the allowance
 
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
then what will happen is as the
 
02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
allowances rise
 
02:26:43.670 --> 02:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money would go back
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
to energy efficiency they would not
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
benefit from increasing allowance prices
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
and that was the intention setting a
 
02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:51.830 align:start position:0%
and that was the intention setting a
floor

02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
floor
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
and saying
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
if that floor is
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
is higher then it would be 15
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the allowances instead of just the
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
one dollar if it's
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
not it stays at least at a floor level
 
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
so this this provides some consistent
 
02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:07.110 align:start position:0%
so this this provides some consistent
funding

02:27:07.110 --> 02:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh and otherwise uh we will be losing
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
out to more investments that we could
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
make in energy efficiency
 
02:27:16.710 --> 02:27:16.720 align:start position:0%

02:30:55.030 --> 02:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
amount is inadequate or how much would
 
02:30:56.950 --> 02:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
be adequate to achieve the implied
 
02:30:59.270 --> 02:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency goals
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
this bill also does not improve the
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency aspects brought up by
 
02:31:03.910 --> 02:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
there were two things one is uh the
 
02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
funding for municipal projects would not
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
increase because that amount is capped
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
two million by rsa 125
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
0-colon 23
 
02:31:19.110 --> 02:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
2b this bill does not increase that cap
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
and then two it changes the
 
02:31:22.550 --> 02:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
administration of the energy efficiency
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
programs from electric distribution
 
02:31:26.630 --> 02:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
companies to be department of energy and
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
department of education if the laudable
 
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
goals of these programs is blown in
 
02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
insulation it's not clear how the
 
02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy or education will
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
do a better job of administering this
 
02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:37.670 align:start position:0%
do a better job of administering this
program

02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore the department of education
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
in their fiscal note stated they do not
 
02:31:42.389 --> 02:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
need additional funds to implement this
 
02:31:44.469 --> 02:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
program presumably they could therefore
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
implement it today with with this
 
02:31:48.550 --> 02:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
without this extra funding
 
02:31:49.990 --> 02:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
finally my constituents tell me that
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
they want lower electric bills and this
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislation does the exact opposite
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
therefore the primary reason for my tl
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
motion is that
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
we should not be artificially raising
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
electric rates thank you
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative berezni further
 
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
comments representative mann has a
 
02:32:06.080 --> 02:32:07.190 align:start position:0%
comments representative mann has a
comment

02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman um first of
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.830 --> 02:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of so-called cost per for a
 
02:32:17.670 --> 02:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
rate payer per month
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
for the um
 
02:32:20.469 --> 02:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
02:32:22.790 --> 02:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:32:26.550 --> 02:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh one utility had showed me 65 cents a
 
02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
uh one utility had showed me 65 cents a
month

02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
a dollar a month can easily be
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if you really want to save more
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
money you can wait the six weeks or five
 
02:32:53.110 --> 02:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
weeks until the led bulb
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
has paid for itself in savings and
 
02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
has paid for itself in savings and
electricity

02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
and you can buy another one
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
and then you can buy a third one
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
and so on until you run out of sockets
 
02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
so the idea that this
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
reggie rebate that's what i'm calling it
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
is a complete waste it's throwing money
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
away that could be used for energy
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency it has no beneficial effect
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
for homeowners it is a complete waste
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
it is in fact the result of a compromise
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
made years ago
 
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
when there was a bill
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:40.150 --> 02:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state director
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.190 --> 02:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:49.429 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:33:49.429 --> 02:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
elimination of reggie's support from new
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire new hampshire and other states
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
had joined in this regional greenhouse
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
gas initiative
 
02:34:01.990 --> 02:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
he apparently not only
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
offended the priorities of new hampshire
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
citizens but also perhaps
 
02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:10.389 align:start position:0%
citizens but also perhaps
offended

02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
offended
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
the senators with whom he was debating
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
the future of of the regional greenhouse
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
gas initiative
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:27.750 --> 02:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
he was making threats and the senators
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
were very angry
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
i showed up i
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
this is history that i've researched
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
i showed up at the scene
 
02:34:40.389 --> 02:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
before i was a rep
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
going to a house hearing on
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
to get rid of reggie
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
and there was a man sitting in the front
 
02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:50.710 align:start position:0%
and there was a man sitting in the front
row

02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
row
 
02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
and i was sitting with lots of other
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
people in the back
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
and after all this a whole lot of
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
testimony the chairman
 
02:34:59.439 --> 02:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
testimony the chairman
garrity

02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
garrity
 
02:35:03.349 --> 02:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
said to the man sitting in the front row
 
02:35:04.469 --> 02:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
who was
 
02:35:06.309 --> 02:35:06.319 align:start position:0%
corey lewandowski
 
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
we'll never be able to pass this bill
 
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
we'll go with a
 
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
rebate so
 
02:35:15.190 --> 02:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
all of us
 
02:35:17.190 --> 02:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
non-members of the legislature were
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
astonished because we had no idea that
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
it was legal
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
to change a bill in midstream
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
from uh what it was originally to be and
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
turn it into a rebate process of some
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
kind so it was very difficult to figure
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
out what what this was all about
 
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
and the chairman then recessed the uh
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
hearing the house hearing for uh several
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
hours which
 
02:35:44.389 --> 02:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
succeeded in getting rid of most of the
 
02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
people who are upset about this bill
 
02:35:46.399 --> 02:35:47.590 align:start position:0%
people who are upset about this bill
anyway

02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:48.950 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
but then the senate hearing came along
 
02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:52.550 align:start position:0%
but then the senate hearing came along
and

02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:55.750 --> 02:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
it turns out um
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
at the senate hearing this where the
 
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
reggie rebate the the compromise idea
 
02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
came so that apparently this rebate was
 
02:36:05.910 --> 02:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
a compromise made between lewandowski
 
02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
and the chairman of the
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
senate and house
 
02:36:14.550 --> 02:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
committees responsible for energy policy
 
02:36:16.950 --> 02:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
and the compromise was we would stay in
 
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
reggie instead of leaving
 
02:36:20.790 --> 02:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
but we would
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
give away all but a dollar of each
 
02:36:23.280 --> 02:36:24.790 align:start position:0%
give away all but a dollar of each
allowance

02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
allowance
 
02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh this allowance being a unit of
 
02:36:30.389 --> 02:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
payment from the reggie project
 
02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
all except a dollar for each allowance
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
give it away back to
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
residents for electric bills as rebates
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
and again that rebate was worth about a
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
dollar a month now
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
at the senate hearing the um it appeared
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
that the lewandowski had been tricked
 
02:36:51.590 --> 02:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
because he was absolutely frantic in mr
 
02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:53.110 align:start position:0%
because he was absolutely frantic in mr
chairman

02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh please suspend uh representatives
 
02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
what is your point of order well i don't
 
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
know what this has to do with anything
 
02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
and um i take exception to hearing
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
disparaging marks about against somebody
 
02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
who isn't here to defend themselves
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just reporting well taken uh
 
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative mann if you could give us
 
02:37:13.270 --> 02:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
your history lesson without making any
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
disparaging remarks about persons so
 
02:37:24.870 --> 02:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.190 --> 02:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
the so-called reggie rebate stayed in
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
other words it was stayed in effect so
 
02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:35.429 align:start position:0%
other words it was stayed in effect so
the

02:37:35.429 --> 02:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
dissipation i what basically this does
 
02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
this did
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
was to take most of the funding that
 
02:37:43.990 --> 02:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
reggie was raising
 
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:44.950 align:start position:0%
reggie was raising
and

02:37:44.950 --> 02:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:47.910 --> 02:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
threw it away uh if you if you can call
 
02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
it that a dollar a month really isn't
 
02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
enough to make a difference in a
 
02:37:55.429 --> 02:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
in a household and again uh a single led
 
02:37:55.439 --> 02:37:56.389 align:start position:0%
in a household and again uh a single led
bulb

02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
bulb
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
pretty much wipes out that problem
 
02:37:58.240 --> 02:37:59.349 align:start position:0%
pretty much wipes out that problem
anyway

02:37:59.349 --> 02:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:38:02.550 --> 02:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
so uh there really is no need for this
 
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
reggie rebate anymore and i put several
 
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
bills in
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
that were reliably vetoed
 
02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
this

02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:38:16.319 --> 02:38:17.190 align:start position:0%
this
bill

02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:18.150 align:start position:0%
bill
is

02:38:18.150 --> 02:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
just the
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
next attempt to
 
02:38:23.349 --> 02:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
eliminate the rebate but instead of
 
02:38:26.790 --> 02:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
doing it all in one shot
 
02:38:29.190 --> 02:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
it does it gradually over several years
 
02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:29.990 align:start position:0%
it does it gradually over several years
by

02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:38:32.230 --> 02:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
2028 i think
 
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
so that's basically the essence of the
 
02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:35.429 align:start position:0%
so that's basically the essence of the
bill

02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:37.110 --> 02:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
my argument is
 
02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:39.439 align:start position:0%
we should not be dissipating money that
 
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
is available to do energy efficiency
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
which is very valuable to families
 
02:38:50.710 --> 02:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.309 --> 02:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
just because of a historical compromise
 
02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:58.230 align:start position:0%
just because of a historical compromise
between

02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
americans for prosperity agent who by
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
the way
 
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
and the people of new hampshire
 
02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:10.630 align:start position:0%
and the people of new hampshire
so

02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:10.640 --> 02:39:11.670 align:start position:0%
so
this

02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
this is something to
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
getting rid of this rebate is something
 
02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's very important to do
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh the bill does it in a gradual way
 
02:39:22.469 --> 02:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
over seven or eight years
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
and will be painless
 
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
if it is again if it is painless for
 
02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:29.590 align:start position:0%
if it is again if it is painless for
anyone

02:39:29.590 --> 02:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
i will be very happy to give him the
 
02:39:34.710 --> 02:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
gift of a led bellman tell him how to
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
parlay that in
 
02:39:39.670 --> 02:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
to replacing all of his bulbs with led
 
02:39:41.910 --> 02:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
bulbs without spending a penny of his
 
02:39:44.710 --> 02:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
own money thank you
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
02:39:47.670 --> 02:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
generous offer to
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
help us buy
 
02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:50.830 align:start position:0%
help us buy
led

02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
led
 
02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
bulbs i would remind you that um
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
the argument that this
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
is merely a drop in the bucket
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:06.389 --> 02:40:06.399 align:start position:0%
but today
 
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
we spend four percent
 
02:40:10.630 --> 02:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
of every electricity bill
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
every ratepayer electricity bill on
 
02:40:14.950 --> 02:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
and another three percent for the
 
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard for a
 
02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
combined total of seven percent
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
when you add to that
 
02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
that go go along with that program
 
02:40:35.429 --> 02:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
and charges from reggie
 
02:40:38.230 --> 02:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
you're closing in on 10
 
02:40:39.750 --> 02:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
of an electricity
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
rate payer's electricity bill
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
these programs
 
02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's no longer a drop it up in the
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
bucket when it becomes 10 of a rate
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
payer's bill
 
02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
02:40:54.319 --> 02:40:56.230 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
bill

02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
if you look at the fiscal note the very
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
last paragraph
 
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
the departments indicate the decrease of
 
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
ratepayer rebates will result in some
 
02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
near-term increase in electricity costs
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
for state county and local governments
 
02:41:14.160 --> 02:41:15.429 align:start position:0%
for state county and local governments
however

02:41:15.429 --> 02:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:41:18.389 --> 02:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
over the long term increased investment
 
02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
in energy efficiency projects would save
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
ratepayers money
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
the cost savings for state county and
 
02:41:27.590 --> 02:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
local governments which also would
 
02:41:30.710 --> 02:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
accrue that's a parenthesis addition
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
those cost savings are indeterminable
 
02:41:36.630 --> 02:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
the way this pro energy efficiency
 
02:41:39.630 --> 02:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
projects work they are guaranteed to
 
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
benefit positive cost benefit ratio at a
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
minimum two to one often four to one
 
02:41:49.990 --> 02:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is money that makes money it's an
 
02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
investment that is guaranteed that is
 
02:41:56.950 --> 02:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
audited and that produces savings for
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
everyone for everyone when we do things
 
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
more efficiently what we're cutting is
 
02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:04.070 align:start position:0%
more efficiently what we're cutting is
waste

02:42:04.070 --> 02:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
waste
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's what we're losing here
 
02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:08.389 align:start position:0%
that's what we're losing here
waste

02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
waste
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
these monies are needed the the other
 
02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
reggie states around us have
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrated over 10 years you look at
 
02:42:17.429 --> 02:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
the figures which
 
02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
mike fitzgerald here from des has
 
02:42:22.230 --> 02:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
provided us with year in and year out
 
02:42:25.429 --> 02:42:25.439 align:start position:0%
the numbers demonstrate this is a
 
02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
positive payoff for the rate payers
 
02:42:30.389 --> 02:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
short term
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
yes there is an increase in the bill of
 
02:42:36.950 --> 02:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
pennies but put together this is
 
02:42:40.389 --> 02:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars this is
 
02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
people in mobile homes who are
 
02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
having fires because of their
 
02:42:48.070 --> 02:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
inefficient heating systems being able
 
02:42:51.190 --> 02:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
to have livable lives of students being
 
02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
able to study and and perform their
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
homework without their fingers being
 
02:42:58.389 --> 02:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
cold this is about getting a new
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
refrigerator that runs at 10 the cost of
 
02:43:04.070 --> 02:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
an old refrigerator
 
02:43:06.230 --> 02:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency isn't just blowing in
 
02:43:09.349 --> 02:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
insulation it it's across the board it's
 
02:43:12.630 --> 02:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
a demonstrated proven winner and we only
 
02:43:15.429 --> 02:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
hurt ourselves and rate payers when we
 
02:43:17.750 --> 02:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
cut off the investment funds
 
02:43:19.030 --> 02:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:21.429 --> 02:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments on our
 
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
discussion on this bill representative
 
02:43:27.830 --> 02:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:29.830 --> 02:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to look at some of the reps
 
02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i want to look at them in the eye
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
having sat here and threw all these
 
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
attacks on reggie over the years
 
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
and having us wanted to pull out of it
 
02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:44.389 align:start position:0%
and having us wanted to pull out of it
and

02:43:44.389 --> 02:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
this and that and the other thing
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
i would like to know
 
02:43:53.750 --> 02:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
one i appreciated the history lesson and
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
the refreshing my memory because i sat
 
02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
through those discussions
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:02.479 --> 02:44:03.670 align:start position:0%
 
that

02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:05.910 --> 02:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
some people on this committee were great
 
02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:08.950 align:start position:0%
some people on this committee were great
proponents

02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
of the rebreak of the
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
rebate program
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
and they were not from my party
 
02:44:19.269 --> 02:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
i would like to know from somebody if
 
02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
anybody can tell me
 
02:44:24.309 --> 02:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
what's the average rebate
 
02:44:26.550 --> 02:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
for a customer an average customer will
 
02:44:29.510 --> 02:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
be based on a certain amount of kilowatt
 
02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:31.269 align:start position:0%
be based on a certain amount of kilowatt
hours

02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
hours
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
and look at the price of fuel when i
 
02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:44.720 align:start position:0%
look at the price of home fuel i
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
i see it on my way home there's a
 
02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
advertisement oh my gosh
 
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
how can anybody you know how do you go
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
and say uh
 
02:44:56.070 --> 02:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
give me 200 gallons of fuel
 
02:44:59.349 --> 02:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
and how do we compensate for that
 
02:45:01.510 --> 02:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
we take it out of the state treasury
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:04.150 align:start position:0%
because we have
funds

02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:45:07.269 --> 02:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
that compensate low income people
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
for fuel
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
so if we could save some of that money
 
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
that we're taking out of state funds
 
02:45:20.389 --> 02:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
to compensate people for fuel
 
02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps we would look differently
 
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
at what this reggie savings program does
 
02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
and quantify the cost benefit
 
02:45:35.190 --> 02:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
analysis that we talk so much about
 
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
against what the average rebate
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
per month to a customer is
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
i would dare to say
 
02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
they are not even buying a cup of coffee
 
02:45:48.389 --> 02:45:48.399 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
and we're taking out of one hand and
 
02:45:53.269 --> 02:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
giving it out with the other
 
02:45:57.349 --> 02:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
i think that the medium income person
 
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
because we do hand out energy efficiency
 
02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:06.309 align:start position:0%
because we do hand out energy efficiency
funds

02:46:06.309 --> 02:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we could spread that a little bit
 
02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:10.710 align:start position:0%
maybe we could spread that a little bit
more

02:46:10.710 --> 02:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
our fuel assistance funds if we could
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
spread that out a little bit more if we
 
02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:16.070 align:start position:0%
spread that out a little bit more if we
had

02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
more fuel efficient
 
02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:20.790 align:start position:0%
more fuel efficient
homes

02:46:20.790 --> 02:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:22.710 --> 02:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
02:46:25.910 --> 02:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
my statement and my question
 
02:46:27.349 --> 02:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
to anyone
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
what is the average rebate based on the
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours that we use to do all
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
these figurings
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
representative plett is recognized for
 
02:46:44.389 --> 02:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
comment yes thank you what i don't
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
understand is why it makes sense to
 
02:46:48.710 --> 02:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
charge an electric rate payer a tax
 
02:46:50.389 --> 02:46:50.399 align:start position:0%
which is reggie is
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
and then apply it to an oil furnace i
 
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
mean heating
 
02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
insulation which helps oil furnaces
 
02:46:56.880 --> 02:46:57.750 align:start position:0%
insulation which helps oil furnaces
helps

02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
helps
 
02:46:59.990 --> 02:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
kerosene furnaces and propane why not
 
02:47:06.309 --> 02:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh further comments on this question
 
02:47:14.469 --> 02:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.349 --> 02:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
the the short answer is that as we move
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
to a clean energy future we're using
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
clean electricity to produce heat not
 
02:47:26.790 --> 02:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
using like what's now called beneficial
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
electrification so that we're
 
02:47:31.590 --> 02:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's at the moment
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
because so many people still
 
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
are you know addicted to fossil fuels
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
yes most of those rebates are going to
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
homes that are heated by fossil fuels
 
02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
the end goal here and in the
 
02:47:47.670 --> 02:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
intermediate goal is to be moving to
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
much more efficient heat pumps and and
 
02:47:54.070 --> 02:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
no longer subsidizing uh you know this
 
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
whole program of fuel assistance just
 
02:47:57.990 --> 02:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
keeps people on fossil fuels we need to
 
02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
be moving off of that and to do that we
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
need to be investing money in more
 
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
efficient ways of heating homes
 
02:48:08.550 --> 02:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
building homes in ways that they don't
 
02:48:10.070 --> 02:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
require as much
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's a circular system and if you can
 
02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
start breaking out of the system and get
 
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
into the virtuous circle you're changing
 
02:48:19.990 --> 02:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
the energy system you're changing the
 
02:48:22.630 --> 02:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
electricity and so that this program
 
02:48:24.790 --> 02:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
which you may think at the moment is
 
02:48:27.670 --> 02:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
taking money from fuel oils to
 
02:48:30.150 --> 02:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
electricity would be an electricity to
 
02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:38.710 --> 02:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
this discussion about throwing more
 
02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:42.030 align:start position:0%
this discussion about throwing more
money

02:48:42.030 --> 02:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:48:44.790 --> 02:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
after uh
 
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency programs reminds me of
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
a story that i was going to tell
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
come up to me after the meeting and i'll
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi is recognized
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
for a question or a comment
 
02:49:06.710 --> 02:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman you know the uh
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
the issue here of of how much this uh
 
02:49:14.309 --> 02:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
rebate is and what it what what's it
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
what needs to be done with it
 
02:49:19.429 --> 02:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
you know is very interesting but my
 
02:49:19.439 --> 02:49:20.950 align:start position:0%
you know is very interesting but my
constituents

02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
are outraged at the cost of their
 
02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
electricity bill right now and they look
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
at that bill and they say what's this
 
02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
charge what's this charge why am i
 
02:49:32.710 --> 02:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
getting this what's happening here and
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
anytime that happens
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
we need to be sensitive to that i am
 
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
very sensitive that these charges do not
 
02:49:43.990 --> 02:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
need to be increased when our electric
 
02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:50.550 --> 02:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee is recognized
 
02:49:52.469 --> 02:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
for a comment thank you mr chairman i
 
02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
think the thing that is interesting
 
02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
about the regional greenhouse gas
 
02:49:59.190 --> 02:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
initiative is that is that the
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
the accounting is done based on
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
carbon emitters right so it's basically
 
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
a carbon tax it's not it's not part of
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
the electric bill
 
02:50:09.990 --> 02:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
02:50:11.750 --> 02:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
money is money that's rebated to the
 
02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:13.990 align:start position:0%
money is money that's rebated to the
state

02:50:13.990 --> 02:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:50:16.230 --> 02:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
based on auctions where they decide how
 
02:50:18.550 --> 02:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
much the carbon is going to cost and
 
02:50:20.870 --> 02:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's how much carbon is emitted in this
 
02:50:23.670 --> 02:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
state so the argument about the bill
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't about the bill that's not
 
02:50:28.150 --> 02:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
where it rate payers are not paying the
 
02:50:29.670 --> 02:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
money that comes to the state the
 
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
millions that come to the state
 
02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
what what representative mann's bill is
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
trying to do is take the money that we
 
02:50:39.030 --> 02:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
already receive from the regional
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative
 
02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:41.990 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas initiative
funding

02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
funding
 
02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:42.790 align:start position:0%
funding
and

02:50:42.790 --> 02:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
instead of giving it back to everybody
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
evenly so that
 
02:50:47.750 --> 02:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
they don't even know that it's there but
 
02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have it to use for anything to
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
use it for what it was intended for
 
02:50:56.469 --> 02:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
which is to get us ahead on trying to
 
02:50:59.429 --> 02:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
convert to a cleaner system
 
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
it's money that was intended
 
02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
specifically to help us fund something
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't have to come out of
 
02:51:08.469 --> 02:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
people's pockets and what we're arguing
 
02:51:10.630 --> 02:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
is we want to put pennies back in those
 
02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
pockets rather than use it collectively
 
02:51:15.190 --> 02:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
to lower our demand for everybody and
 
02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
lower costs for everybody and so we
 
02:51:19.429 --> 02:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
don't get the benefit of that cost
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
multiplier that's what we're being given
 
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
we're being given a chunk of money
 
02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:25.750 align:start position:0%
we're being given a chunk of money
and

02:51:25.750 --> 02:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:28.150 --> 02:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
and we're frittering it away instead of
 
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
letting it work for us so
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's the difference between how we
 
02:51:33.830 --> 02:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
view reggie in the state or how we've
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
been viewing it
 
02:51:37.750 --> 02:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
and how other states are using it so i
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
make you know make people understand
 
02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:43.190 align:start position:0%
make you know make people understand
that

02:51:43.190 --> 02:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:51:45.429 --> 02:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
you're giving pennies back to people but
 
02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
you're not taking money away from them
 
02:51:49.510 --> 02:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
by using that money because that money
 
02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
is coming to the state for the state's
 
02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
use so the state could put that into
 
02:51:55.590 --> 02:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency and benefit everybody
 
02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i just think we don't always
 
02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
understand how
 
02:52:01.590 --> 02:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
how it operates
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
of course every ratepayer does pay the
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
cost for that because it's bundled into
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
the price of the electricity
 
02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:10.150 align:start position:0%
the price of the electricity
that

02:52:10.150 --> 02:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
they receive
 
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
when they buy electricity
 
02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative mann your microphone
 
02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
seems to be on all the time can you turn
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
it off
 
02:52:24.550 --> 02:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
you can okay just just uh checking on
 
02:52:25.990 --> 02:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
again as well did you have one more
 
02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
comment you wanted to make
 
02:52:30.469 --> 02:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
02:52:37.590 --> 02:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:42.389 --> 02:52:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:45.269 --> 02:52:45.279 align:start position:0%
you've got to drive the oil into the
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
furnace you've got to distribute the
 
02:52:50.469 --> 02:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
heat either whether it's an air hot air
 
02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
so you use electricity
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:02.550 --> 02:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
if the effect of energy efficiency on
 
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
your electric bill will be a lower the
 
02:53:06.389 --> 02:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
electric bill
 
02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
that all this money was being is being
 
02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
created by our membership in reggie we
 
02:53:28.630 --> 02:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
are seriously trying to reduce
 
02:53:31.510 --> 02:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
co2 pollution
 
02:53:33.590 --> 02:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
and all this
 
02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
money is made available and we choose as
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
a state as a state government
 
02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for what we do
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
i accidentally turned off your mic
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely enraging
 
02:53:53.670 --> 02:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
i just go back to the point i'll go back
 
02:53:57.190 --> 02:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
every heating system requires
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
electricity and you'll save plenty of
 
02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:02.070 align:start position:0%
electricity and you'll save plenty of
electricity

02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
02:54:03.269 --> 02:54:03.279 align:start position:0%
with this
 
02:54:05.830 --> 02:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
money that is now being thrown away
 
02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we're going around in
 
02:54:10.469 --> 02:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
circles here we don't seem to be getting
 
02:54:10.479 --> 02:54:11.590 align:start position:0%
circles here we don't seem to be getting
anywhere

02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh so i think i would like to ask the
 
02:54:17.910 --> 02:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
all right representative samsich
 
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
underscore the fact that first of all
 
02:54:28.880 --> 02:54:30.550 align:start position:0%
underscore the fact that first of all
insulation

02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
insulation
 
02:54:32.550 --> 02:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
helps everything
 
02:54:34.230 --> 02:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
even mobile home parks have air
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
conditioning that runs on electricity
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
and an insulated mobile home is a better
 
02:54:40.630 --> 02:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
one than an uninsulated
 
02:54:43.269 --> 02:54:43.279 align:start position:0%
the funding that is used
 
02:54:45.429 --> 02:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
in various ways from from this kind of
 
02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
program includes the funding for uh
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
low-income energy efficiency measures
 
02:54:55.269 --> 02:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
and only several years ago we were told
 
02:54:57.670 --> 02:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
that the backlog the waiting list for
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
that was almost 10 years
 
02:55:01.990 --> 02:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
so this idea that we have plenty of
 
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
funds uh and and we don't need more
 
02:55:08.070 --> 02:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's just a mythology
 
02:55:10.309 --> 02:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
we've never been able to service all the
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
people who have asked that funding now
 
02:55:15.269 --> 02:55:15.279 align:start position:0%
what does that do for the individuals
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
who get the
 
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency measures it helps
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
their particular
 
02:55:23.670 --> 02:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
site reduce energy use but it benefits
 
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
everybody when we reduce demand we
 
02:55:29.510 --> 02:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
reduce transmission costs the number one
 
02:55:32.230 --> 02:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
factor over the last 10 years increasing
 
02:55:34.710 --> 02:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
on our electricity bill is not the price
 
02:55:36.469 --> 02:55:36.479 align:start position:0%
of energy it was the price of
 
02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
transmission costs that went up higher
 
02:55:40.870 --> 02:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
in our state than in the neighboring
 
02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
states for the very reason because we
 
02:55:45.269 --> 02:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
were not doing much about reducing our
 
02:55:45.279 --> 02:55:46.550 align:start position:0%
were not doing much about reducing our
demand

02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
demand
 
02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:47.830 align:start position:0%
demand
transmission

02:55:47.830 --> 02:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
reduction helps everyone
 
02:55:53.910 --> 02:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
business activity that's connected to uh
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
all the efforts for energy efficiency
 
02:55:56.399 --> 02:55:57.429 align:start position:0%
all the efforts for energy efficiency
measures

02:55:57.429 --> 02:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
measures
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
for both insulation as well as for
 
02:56:00.399 --> 02:56:01.670 align:start position:0%
for both insulation as well as for
projects

02:56:01.670 --> 02:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
projects
 
02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
02:56:06.150 --> 02:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
they generate business activity jobs
 
02:56:08.309 --> 02:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
something in our economy and they reduce
 
02:56:10.389 --> 02:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
the amount of fossil fuels we need to
 
02:56:12.389 --> 02:56:12.399 align:start position:0%
import from out of state and out of the
 
02:56:12.399 --> 02:56:13.349 align:start position:0%
import from out of state and out of the
country

02:56:13.349 --> 02:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:56:15.750 --> 02:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
all these things actually impact
 
02:56:17.990 --> 02:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
everybody even if you don't make use of
 
02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
these the energy program yourself
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
indirectly by doing this
 
02:56:27.750 --> 02:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
they will drive down your costs so
 
02:56:29.990 --> 02:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
these measures help everybody not just
 
02:56:32.230 --> 02:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
the person actually making use of them
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
during the
 
02:56:39.910 --> 02:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations that i conducted with the
 
02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
senate on house bill 549
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
which the senate passed last thursday on
 
02:56:47.590 --> 02:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
its consent calendar
 
02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
and that bill will be coming back to us
 
02:56:52.469 --> 02:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
for concurrence
 
02:56:52.479 --> 02:56:53.990 align:start position:0%
for concurrence
um

02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
next wednesday or thursday whenever
 
02:56:58.469 --> 02:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
it comes up i'm not sure exactly when
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
it'll appear
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'll have to talk to the clerk about
 
02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:02.469 align:start position:0%
i'll have to talk to the clerk about
that

02:57:02.469 --> 02:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
but during the course of those
 
02:57:06.230 --> 02:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
negotiations i asked the senate if they
 
02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
would consider increasing the percentage
 
02:57:10.150 --> 02:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
of money allocated to low-income
 
02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:17.429 --> 02:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
and the answer i got was no
 
02:57:19.750 --> 02:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
which surprised me a little bit
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
but the reasoning behind their answer
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
was that the utilities have told members
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
that they can't find
 
02:57:31.670 --> 02:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
people to take those energy efficiency
 
02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:33.269 align:start position:0%
people to take those energy efficiency
services

02:57:33.269 --> 02:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
beyond 20 percent
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
so they didn't think they could they
 
02:57:40.550 --> 02:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
could find ways to spend that money
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:46.950 --> 02:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to believe but
 
02:57:48.870 --> 02:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
but i had to accept their word for it
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
they refused to budge on increasing that
 
02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
percentage from 20 to 30 percent
 
02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i just point that out any further
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
discussion i think it's time maybe we
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
had a vote
 
02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh thomas has a
 
02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:02.230 align:start position:0%
representative uh thomas has a
con

02:58:02.230 --> 02:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
con
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um sorry to extend
 
02:58:06.469 --> 02:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
this but i just wanted to
 
02:58:08.309 --> 02:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
comment on the previous
 
02:58:08.319 --> 02:58:09.910 align:start position:0%
comment on the previous
representative

02:58:09.910 --> 02:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:58:11.990 --> 02:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
comments involving transmission costs
 
02:58:14.150 --> 02:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
and energy costs
 
02:58:16.710 --> 02:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
it should be known that the
 
02:58:19.429 --> 02:58:19.439 align:start position:0%
cost of your electric bill is the the
 
02:58:21.910 --> 02:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
energy cost is approximately fifty
 
02:58:24.150 --> 02:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
percent of your electric bill
 
02:58:26.150 --> 02:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of transmission
 
02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
is approximately eleven percent of your
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
electric bill while it is true that the
 
02:58:33.190 --> 02:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
percentage increase of cost of
 
02:58:35.590 --> 02:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
transmission has increased over the
 
02:58:38.230 --> 02:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
years higher at a higher rate than the
 
02:58:39.830 --> 02:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
cost of your energy
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
it is still
 
02:58:43.349 --> 02:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
quite a bit lower than the cost of
 
02:58:45.269 --> 02:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
energy so if you can decrease the cost
 
02:58:47.110 --> 02:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
of your energy
 
02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
by a lot you could decrease your your
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
electric bill that's all i have to say
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
about that i will be supporting the
 
02:58:56.630 --> 02:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
the recommendation to itl
 
02:58:58.710 --> 02:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative oxenam
 
02:59:00.070 --> 02:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your indulgence
 
02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
02:59:02.950 --> 02:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
the the point about the
 
02:59:04.710 --> 02:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
increasing electricity costs is not
 
02:59:04.720 --> 02:59:06.309 align:start position:0%
increasing electricity costs is not
about

02:59:06.309 --> 02:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
reggie or this
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
systems benefits charge it's about the
 
02:59:11.990 --> 02:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
cost of natural gas
 
02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
worldwide natural gas prices are going
 
02:59:14.399 --> 02:59:15.110 align:start position:0%
worldwide natural gas prices are going
up

02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:59:17.670 --> 02:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
tremendously we have to pay that because
 
02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
we have not invested in alternatives we
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
have not taken the road of fuel
 
02:59:25.590 --> 02:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
diversity and to to say that you know we
 
02:59:27.110 --> 02:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
have to meet our constituents and say
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
well i'm doing something about the
 
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
electricity bill when you're working on
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
the one percent and the three percent
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the six percent
 
02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:34.630 align:start position:0%
and the six percent
it's

02:59:34.630 --> 02:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:59:37.510 --> 02:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes energy is is fifty percent and
 
02:59:40.389 --> 02:59:40.399 align:start position:0%
that's the big problem we have to change
 
02:59:43.349 --> 02:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
our energy system and to do that we have
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
funding through reggie we're throwing
 
02:59:48.550 --> 02:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
the money away that money needs to be
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
safeguarded it needs to be stewarded it
 
02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be used for the projects that
 
02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
will pay off for our ratepayers for our
 
02:59:58.550 --> 02:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
businesses to grow our economy not
 
03:00:00.550 --> 03:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
sending four to six billion dollars out
 
03:00:02.790 --> 03:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
of state every year on fossil fuels
 
03:00:05.030 --> 03:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
investing it in hydro
 
03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:05.990 align:start position:0%
investing it in hydro
wind

03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
wind
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
solar that are here these are our new
 
03:00:10.630 --> 03:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire industries please
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:17.030 --> 03:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative oxenom is correct about
 
03:00:19.030 --> 03:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
the price of natural gas
 
03:00:21.910 --> 03:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
driving the cost of electricity about 70
 
03:00:26.309 --> 03:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
percent of the time or 70 percent of the
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
marginal price is set by the price of
 
03:00:31.110 --> 03:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
gas earlier today the locational
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
marginal price was over 300 dollars
 
03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
and right now it's down to about 142
 
03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
dollars per megawatt hour and that's
 
03:00:42.150 --> 03:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
largely largely due to the fact that the
 
03:00:44.389 --> 03:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
temperature has warmed up outside and
 
03:00:46.950 --> 03:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're now using 58 percent
 
03:00:48.870 --> 03:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the gas
 
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
available to us to generate electricity
 
03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
whereas this morning we're only
 
03:00:55.429 --> 03:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
losing about 40 percent gas because
 
03:00:57.750 --> 03:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
there wasn't enough gas available
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
so representative kreshan is recognized
 
03:01:01.990 --> 03:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
for a comment thank you and i promise
 
03:01:03.990 --> 03:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief um i'm really glad that
 
03:01:06.309 --> 03:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
you brought up the bill that just went
 
03:01:08.550 --> 03:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
through the other body um because i
 
03:01:10.870 --> 03:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to remind everyone that just a
 
03:01:13.590 --> 03:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
month ago we voted unanimously as a
 
03:01:16.389 --> 03:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
house on the importance of funding new
 
03:01:18.710 --> 03:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire saves um i know we've had lots
 
03:01:20.550 --> 03:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
of conversations in this committee about
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
whether the system's benefits charge is
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism for this reggie to me
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
seems like it's meant for
 
03:01:30.150 --> 03:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
for this it's meant for energy
 
03:01:32.070 --> 03:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency it's meant for
 
03:01:33.510 --> 03:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know reducing our dependence on
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
carbon so
 
03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:35.670 align:start position:0%
carbon so
um

03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know whatever your feelings about
 
03:01:40.309 --> 03:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
the sbc why not use this bulk of money
 
03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
to fund um the projects that it's meant
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
for thank you
 
03:01:45.990 --> 03:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay i hope we've exhausted this topic
 
03:01:48.070 --> 03:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
and can
 
03:01:50.230 --> 03:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
move on to a vote we do have another

so uh mr mr chairman can i just make uh
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
an informational comment here

representative samsic uh i think uh last
 
03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
time we met uh at hearings
 
03:03:52.870 --> 03:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
we there was the talk about whether
 
03:03:55.990 --> 03:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
reggie had issued its annual report
 
03:03:58.710 --> 03:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
about the regis reggie program
 
03:04:02.230 --> 03:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
and i came across a report october 1st
 
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
dated to this committee
 
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is the official
 
03:04:09.269 --> 03:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
reggie annual report and incidentally
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
that's also that's a report that went to
 
03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:12.790 align:start position:0%
that's also that's a report that went to
the

03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
to the uh oversight committee as well at
 
03:04:16.389 --> 03:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:04:18.150 --> 03:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:04:19.830 --> 03:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
so i'll close the public hearing on
 
03:04:22.790 --> 03:04:22.800 align:start position:0%

we'll recess the exact session and be
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%

those

03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:26.070 --> 03:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay five minutes are up let's move on i
 
03:10:28.229 --> 03:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
would like to open the public the
 
03:10:30.790 --> 03:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill
 
03:10:30.800 --> 03:10:32.870 align:start position:0%

1644

03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
1644
 
03:10:34.950 --> 03:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
03:10:34.960 --> 03:10:37.030 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
thomas

03:10:37.030 --> 03:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
thomas
 
03:10:39.670 --> 03:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
i want to preface my comments by saying
 
03:10:45.030 --> 03:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee on 1644 met
 
03:10:46.309 --> 03:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
and today
 
03:10:46.319 --> 03:10:47.190 align:start position:0%
and today
we

03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:10:47.200 --> 03:10:48.469 align:start position:0%
we
voted

03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
voted
 
03:10:52.630 --> 03:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
to recommend interim study on this bill
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
and um so therefore i am making a motion
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
to i to interim study 1644 i'll follow
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
with comments after the second
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative knotter is recognized
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we
 
03:11:11.910 --> 03:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
report hb 1644
 
03:11:11.920 --> 03:11:14.710 align:start position:0%
report hb 1644
as

03:11:14.710 --> 03:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:16.710 --> 03:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
moved to interim study and
 
03:11:18.870 --> 03:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized to
 
03:11:21.190 --> 03:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion thank you mr chair
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
because this issue is so complex and
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
additionally emotionally charged i would
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
like to read my comments because
 
03:11:32.630 --> 03:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
i think i've wore them carefully the
 
03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:34.309 align:start position:0%
i think i've wore them carefully the
committee

03:11:34.309 --> 03:11:34.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:11:37.750 --> 03:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
was confused but my comments are
 
03:11:39.830 --> 03:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
that the committee heard testimony that
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
clearly showed people who lived near
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
radio frequency emitting towers had
 
03:11:46.469 --> 03:11:46.479 align:start position:0%
various physical and neurological
 
03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
medical issues
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
testimony was also heard explaining the
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
5g technology which is mainly a
 
03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
marketing term used to indicate the next
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
generation of cell phone and data
 
03:11:57.670 --> 03:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
equipment it's built on 3 and 4g
 
03:11:59.670 --> 03:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
technology and requires more densely
 
03:12:01.670 --> 03:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
positioned antennas and expanded
 
03:12:01.680 --> 03:12:02.950 align:start position:0%
positioned antennas and expanded
infrastructure

03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
03:12:05.110 --> 03:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
industry leaders in world organizations
 
03:12:06.950 --> 03:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
have produced numerous documents
 
03:12:09.269 --> 03:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
pointing to no serious effects in people
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
from this technology yet it cannot be
 
03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:13.030 align:start position:0%
from this technology yet it cannot be
denied

03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
denied
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
certain people are suffering from
 
03:12:16.389 --> 03:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
various illnesses
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
although there may be a correlation
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
between those who live near towers who
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
suffer from some form of discomfort the
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
committee was uncertain as to the
 
03:12:27.030 --> 03:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
causation of such ailments despite the
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
fact that there was a 14-month
 
03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
commission that presented a very strong
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
report that pointed to the effects
 
03:12:35.030 --> 03:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
of cumulative radio frequency
 
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
bombardment there were equal
 
03:12:38.469 --> 03:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
presentations that pointed to the
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
physics and testing that could that
 
03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
could dispel this claim
 
03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
the committee feels there is enough
 
03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:44.630 align:start position:0%
the committee feels there is enough
doubt

03:12:44.630 --> 03:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
that this bill as presented could not be
 
03:12:49.750 --> 03:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
supported yet a better compromise could
 
03:12:52.150 --> 03:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
be obtained with additional study
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
therefore the committee recommends that
 
03:12:57.670 --> 03:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
we do interim study to produce perhaps a
 
03:12:59.110 --> 03:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
better recommendation for the next
 
03:12:59.120 --> 03:13:06.389 align:start position:0%
better recommendation for the next
biennium

03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:08.630 --> 03:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
i just have a question uh for
 
03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative thomas you said we met
 
03:13:13.910 --> 03:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
today we didn't did we yes we did i you
 
03:13:15.030 --> 03:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
were absent
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
was it an account it was clear it was
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
clearly sent out by carrie an official
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
notice that we're having a subcommittee
 
03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:22.550 align:start position:0%
notice that we're having a subcommittee
today

03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:13:26.870 --> 03:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:29.429 --> 03:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
well it was it it the the subcommittee
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
that this afternoon at 12 30 heard two
 
03:13:33.910 --> 03:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
presenters which also presented during
 
03:13:35.510 --> 03:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
the public hearing so you didn't miss
 
03:13:38.150 --> 03:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
anything but we did have the vote then
 
03:13:40.229 --> 03:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:13:40.239 --> 03:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
as well
i

03:13:41.510 --> 03:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:13:44.150 --> 03:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
i saw that and then i re-looked at the
 
03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
i saw that and then i re-looked at the
calendar

03:13:46.070 --> 03:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:13:48.070 --> 03:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
and the re the calendar didn't have it
 
03:13:49.990 --> 03:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
listed so i
 
03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:51.269 align:start position:0%
listed so i
yeah

03:13:51.269 --> 03:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:14:06.070 --> 03:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i agree with
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
our vice chair and uh we just had so
 
03:14:13.750 --> 03:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
much conflicting information it's like
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
who do you believe and you you can't
 
03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
kill a bill when there's when there's
 
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
doubt and you can't pass it either when
 
03:14:21.590 --> 03:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's doubt and we're watching you
 
03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
know one person testify someone behind
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
them shaking their head and then that
 
03:14:26.710 --> 03:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
person they switch places and then the
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
one behind them is shaking their head
 
03:14:31.110 --> 03:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's like i think our only option is to
 
03:14:31.990 --> 03:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
go to
 
03:14:41.830 --> 03:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:43.429 --> 03:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh there's an amendment however we like
 
03:14:46.309 --> 03:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
to add
 
03:14:48.630 --> 03:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
to the uh bill we're stripping pretty
 
03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
much the language about the registry
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
hoping that would have made it easier to
 
03:14:55.510 --> 03:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
pass i think all that amendment before
 
03:14:55.520 --> 03:14:56.309 align:start position:0%
pass i think all that amendment before
us

03:14:56.309 --> 03:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:14:57.590 --> 03:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it even needs to be
 
03:14:59.110 --> 03:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
acted on if we go to interim study
 
03:14:59.120 --> 03:15:00.309 align:start position:0%
acted on if we go to interim study
though

03:15:00.309 --> 03:15:00.319 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:15:02.389 --> 03:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
which is something which i think is a
 
03:15:03.830 --> 03:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
very good idea
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
but um my concern is the timing
 
03:15:09.190 --> 03:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
that an interim study would involve
 
03:15:11.110 --> 03:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
i make a personal choice when i use a
 
03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
device like this
 
03:15:14.710 --> 03:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
on giving a green light to the industry
 
03:15:16.469 --> 03:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
i'm choosing for every citizen in the
 
03:15:18.070 --> 03:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:15:20.229 --> 03:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
the hippocratic oath says first do no
 
03:15:20.239 --> 03:15:21.269 align:start position:0%
the hippocratic oath says first do no
harm

03:15:21.269 --> 03:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
harm
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
i would hope that you could apply that
 
03:15:22.560 --> 03:15:23.830 align:start position:0%
i would hope that you could apply that
here

03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:15:27.510 --> 03:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
and as i said i support an interim study
 
03:15:29.750 --> 03:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
but a delay in 5g rollout should have no
 
03:15:31.830 --> 03:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
effect on current technology 4g
 
03:15:33.830 --> 03:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
technology and it would provide time to
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
further examine many of these issues
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
which i too am very confused about
 
03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:39.269 align:start position:0%
which i too am very confused about
uh

03:15:39.269 --> 03:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
knowing that these questions on 5g
 
03:15:42.870 --> 03:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
technologies happening in many states
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not too worried about being left
 
03:15:44.319 --> 03:15:45.269 align:start position:0%
i'm not too worried about being left
behind

03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
behind
 
03:15:46.870 --> 03:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
my greater concern is that we're by
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
doing nothing we'll open the state to 5g
 
03:15:51.910 --> 03:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
where it's convenient
 
03:15:53.429 --> 03:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
when we have not even finished the job
 
03:15:55.910 --> 03:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
of limiting our eliminating our 4g holes
 
03:15:57.349 --> 03:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
in coverage
 
03:15:59.190 --> 03:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
or even the broadband fiber coverage
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
which i'd like to add is working very
 
03:16:03.429 --> 03:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
well in my area
 
03:16:03.439 --> 03:16:06.229 align:start position:0%
well in my area
um

03:16:06.229 --> 03:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
we already have this bill amendment i
 
03:16:10.630 --> 03:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
said and one of my fellow
 
03:16:12.790 --> 03:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
representatives here today suggested we
 
03:16:14.710 --> 03:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
could achieve the reasonable moratorium
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
and still explore the many concerns
 
03:16:19.030 --> 03:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
by redrafting an amendment to move up
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
the enactment date but also place a
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable sunset clause on the
 
03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
legislation perhaps a year
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
in that time i would hope you're able to
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
identify and really get a handle on what
 
03:16:30.309 --> 03:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
we're being asked to legislate and i
 
03:16:32.710 --> 03:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
would also add that we could also add a
 
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
further amendment that could address the
 
03:16:36.870 --> 03:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
concerns of ham radio operators which i
 
03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
know we've all received mail to that
 
03:16:38.800 --> 03:16:40.229 align:start position:0%
know we've all received mail to that
effect

03:16:40.229 --> 03:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
effect
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
so there's many reasons to support and
 
03:16:43.030 --> 03:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
oppose a bill
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
i myself am not sure exactly where i
 
03:16:46.469 --> 03:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
stand in technology but one point that
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
concerns me
 
03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
is the legislative overreach that the
 
03:16:52.469 --> 03:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
fcc is imposing on local zoning
 
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
even if i fully support 5g technology
 
03:16:56.830 --> 03:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
should i do nothing
 
03:17:00.389 --> 03:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
and um and one by doing nothing give my
 
03:17:03.750 --> 03:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
tacit approval to that type of overreach
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
so i would strongly urge just call to
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
consider the complexities of the debate
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
and take sufficient time to do what's
 
03:17:10.790 --> 03:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
best in regards to the citizens of new
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire or the minimum as i said
 
03:17:16.150 --> 03:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
before do no harm thank you
 
03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial
 
03:17:17.680 --> 03:17:23.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative partial
representative

03:17:23.510 --> 03:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's all right
 
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
03:17:30.469 --> 03:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
i was just going to reiterate the
 
03:17:30.479 --> 03:17:33.750 align:start position:0%
i was just going to reiterate the
original

03:17:33.750 --> 03:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:36.630 --> 03:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
interim study was mine because i felt
 
03:17:39.190 --> 03:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
that i did not have enough knowledge
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i still at this point feel that i
 
03:17:44.790 --> 03:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
still don't have enough knowledge or
 
03:17:47.190 --> 03:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
enough clarity to vote
 
03:17:47.200 --> 03:17:48.150 align:start position:0%
enough clarity to vote
to

03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:17:50.870 --> 03:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
proceed with this bill but i don't want
 
03:17:52.469 --> 03:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
it to die
 
03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i
 
03:17:55.120 --> 03:17:56.389 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i
would

03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:17:59.590 --> 03:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:02.790 --> 03:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
is if we do have an interim study
 
03:18:05.349 --> 03:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
that means if it passes the study
 
03:18:07.269 --> 03:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
committee would be
 
03:18:07.279 --> 03:18:09.269 align:start position:0%
committee would be
implemented

03:18:09.269 --> 03:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
03:18:11.190 --> 03:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
that is correct in fact i will ask for
 
03:18:12.790 --> 03:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers for the study committee
 
03:18:15.670 --> 03:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
before we leave here this afternoon
 
03:18:15.680 --> 03:18:16.790 align:start position:0%
before we leave here this afternoon
and

03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:18.790 --> 03:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
if i could follow that study committee
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
will meet
 
03:18:23.110 --> 03:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
over the course of
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
could be the summer could be this you
 
03:18:27.190 --> 03:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
know the rest of this year
 
03:18:29.190 --> 03:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
to study this issue
 
03:18:29.200 --> 03:18:30.309 align:start position:0%
to study this issue
correct

03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:39.269 --> 03:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that the discussion seems
 
03:18:40.870 --> 03:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
to be focused on sort of an all or
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
nothing either we you know completely
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
say 5g is uh you know worthwhile and it
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
should go everywhere
 
03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
or you know some people are saying you
 
03:18:51.429 --> 03:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
know we're going to be ending 5g in new
 
03:18:52.950 --> 03:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're going to fall behind the
 
03:18:54.550 --> 03:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
rest of the country
 
03:18:54.560 --> 03:18:55.830 align:start position:0%
rest of the country
this

03:18:55.830 --> 03:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
the commission worked long and hard and
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
came up with a recommendation which is
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
limited it's about
 
03:19:03.520 --> 03:19:04.870 align:start position:0%
limited it's about
restricting

03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
restricting
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of technology in certain
 
03:19:10.150 --> 03:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
kinds of areas and particularly if we
 
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
adopt the amendment which i think would
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
be a benefit because i think the
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
registry has all kinds of issues about
 
03:19:16.080 --> 03:19:16.950 align:start position:0%
registry has all kinds of issues about
it

03:19:16.950 --> 03:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
it would allow us to proceed
 
03:19:22.630 --> 03:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
fiber optic is being rolled out in many
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
parts of the state
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
but there are parts as we heard this
 
03:19:29.030 --> 03:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
morning particularly wilderness
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
rescues and also for first responders
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
where you do need cell coverage
 
03:19:35.590 --> 03:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
but by moving
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
forward towards fiber optic and having
 
03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:40.070 align:start position:0%
forward towards fiber optic and having
cells

03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
cells
 
03:19:43.190 --> 03:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
fill in the areas that fiber optic it
 
03:19:46.229 --> 03:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
cannot reach we can we can achieve an
 
03:19:48.870 --> 03:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
optimal situation so but this bill does
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
not ask us to prefer any technology over
 
03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:52.790 align:start position:0%
not ask us to prefer any technology over
another

03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
another
 
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
it simply says we have concerns about
 
03:19:58.870 --> 03:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
this one technology in certain areas
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know we've been told oh but it's low
 
03:20:03.510 --> 03:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
frequency and they're you know but they
 
03:20:06.790 --> 03:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
have to be 250 feet apart well you get a
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of those things
 
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
all in the circle and they're all
 
03:20:12.550 --> 03:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
radiating out and they don't simply
 
03:20:14.950 --> 03:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
radiate in every direction they go out
 
03:20:17.269 --> 03:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
in a flat line so you're talking about a
 
03:20:17.279 --> 03:20:18.790 align:start position:0%
in a flat line so you're talking about a
circumference

03:20:18.790 --> 03:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
circumference
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
at head height
 
03:20:22.469 --> 03:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
this is a technology which our
 
03:20:22.479 --> 03:20:23.670 align:start position:0%
this is a technology which our
commission

03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:20:25.269 --> 03:20:25.279 align:start position:0%
worked hard
 
03:20:28.150 --> 03:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
for long hours brought in experts
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
considered this
 
03:20:32.229 --> 03:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
this is a recommendation that i think we
 
03:20:34.469 --> 03:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
do need to give due respect to the work
 
03:20:37.110 --> 03:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
that was done yes we've had difficulty
 
03:20:39.429 --> 03:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
wrapping our heads around it i listened
 
03:20:41.670 --> 03:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
to the sub the original public hearing
 
03:20:41.680 --> 03:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
to the sub the original public hearing
on

03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:20:45.190 --> 03:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
youtube i sat in on the subcommittee
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
meetings i've i've listened to this i've
 
03:20:49.590 --> 03:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
talked to experts outside of this room
 
03:20:53.110 --> 03:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's a difficult difficult issue but
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
this recommendation is not saying
 
03:21:01.110 --> 03:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
yes to f5g no to 5g yes to this no it's
 
03:21:01.120 --> 03:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
yes to f5g no to 5g yes to this no it's
saying

03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:21:05.590 --> 03:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
let's limit this in areas where
 
03:21:05.600 --> 03:21:07.030 align:start position:0%
let's limit this in areas where
residences

03:21:07.030 --> 03:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
residences
 
03:21:07.040 --> 03:21:08.150 align:start position:0%
residences
schools

03:21:08.150 --> 03:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
schools
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
hospitals let's make sure that we don't
 
03:21:11.359 --> 03:21:12.630 align:start position:0%
hospitals let's make sure that we don't
have

03:21:12.630 --> 03:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:21:12.640 --> 03:21:13.429 align:start position:0%
have
and

03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
this technology which is on top of all
 
03:21:18.790 --> 03:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
the other technologies
 
03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:19.590 align:start position:0%
the other technologies
and

03:21:19.590 --> 03:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:22.469 --> 03:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
for biological systems we have to think
 
03:21:25.590 --> 03:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
about cumulative impacts not simply what
 
03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
what is this one doing but what is this
 
03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
one doing on top of all of the others so
 
03:21:32.630 --> 03:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
i would i would suggest that we
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
seriously consider the amendment and we
 
03:21:37.349 --> 03:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
move forward with ought to pass
 
03:21:40.710 --> 03:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
with simply these limited restrictions
 
03:21:43.190 --> 03:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
that came out of the hard work of that
 
03:21:43.200 --> 03:21:44.550 align:start position:0%
that came out of the hard work of that
commission

03:21:44.550 --> 03:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:21:47.590 --> 03:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:49.590 --> 03:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion on the
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
motion representative thomas thank you
 
03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
03:21:57.990 --> 03:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
this bill as written
 
03:21:59.429 --> 03:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
had no chance of passing through the
 
03:22:01.110 --> 03:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
house in my opinion
 
03:22:02.790 --> 03:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
and in talking to
 
03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
a senator who was co-sponsored on this
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
bill admitted it
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
would be a very very
 
03:22:13.429 --> 03:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
big effort to have it pass in the senate
 
03:22:14.630 --> 03:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
03:22:14.640 --> 03:22:15.750 align:start position:0%
i believe
that

03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:22:17.830 --> 03:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
something should pass
 
03:22:19.990 --> 03:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
if we went forward with this or the
 
03:22:22.950 --> 03:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
amendment it likely would not pass the
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
house but even if it did it would more
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
likely not pass the senate and we would
 
03:22:29.190 --> 03:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
be left with nothing
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
i believe that the interim study is
 
03:22:34.150 --> 03:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
paves a way forward for us to come up
 
03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
with better wording
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
and perhaps a
 
03:22:39.910 --> 03:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
compromise if you will
 
03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
of something
 
03:22:44.070 --> 03:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
that could get a foot in the door to
 
03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
handle this this perceived problem it
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
may very well be a problem
 
03:22:51.190 --> 03:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
and to further examine
 
03:22:53.670 --> 03:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
a better way to handle this technology
 
03:22:53.680 --> 03:22:54.630 align:start position:0%
a better way to handle this technology
so

03:22:54.630 --> 03:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:22:57.429 --> 03:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
interim study in my book
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
gives us a chance to
 
03:23:02.550 --> 03:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
improve on this bill and get something
 
03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:06.870 align:start position:0%
improve on this bill and get something
done

03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and uh i i
 
03:23:12.630 --> 03:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate the comments uh from
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative thomas and i would just
 
03:23:18.150 --> 03:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
like to say that um
 
03:23:19.990 --> 03:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
you know i agree that
 
03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
that the commission did good work and
 
03:23:23.910 --> 03:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
that they
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
tried very hard to put what they felt
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
was the prescription or the solution
 
03:23:29.349 --> 03:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
into the bill
 
03:23:31.429 --> 03:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
but i i think we we've heard enough
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
testimony from people who have talked
 
03:23:35.429 --> 03:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
about other considerations that were not
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
the focus of that commission that have
 
03:23:39.349 --> 03:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
to be considered
 
03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
and so from my perspective whether it's
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
the department of safety's concerns or i
 
03:23:46.950 --> 03:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
heard someone earlier say some hospitals
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
would want the antenna to be closed for
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
the first responder and other types of
 
03:23:53.750 --> 03:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
things there are considerations that we
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
have not deliberated on
 
03:23:58.469 --> 03:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
that would need to be included in the
 
03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
bill for it to really serve everyone and
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's that i would i would go
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
along with
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
further study to answer some of those
 
03:24:09.429 --> 03:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
questions because i think we can't
 
03:24:11.190 --> 03:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
as with many bills we can't listen to
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
only one constituency and their concerns
 
03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
we have to understand when we put
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
something in place that it actually
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
works for the people we intend it to
 
03:24:20.309 --> 03:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
work for and that means we have to talk
 
03:24:22.710 --> 03:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
to them so
 
03:24:49.990 --> 03:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:50.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:24:50.950 --> 03:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
oh there we go had to turn it on and off
 
03:24:55.210 --> 03:24:55.220 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly unplug it and yeah
 
03:24:55.220 --> 03:24:57.990 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly unplug it and yeah
[Laughter]

03:24:57.990 --> 03:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:00.389 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
um

03:25:00.389 --> 03:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
oh sure okay
 
03:25:04.870 --> 03:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:25:06.630 --> 03:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
i guess what i'm wondering is is that we
 
03:25:08.389 --> 03:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
really have a it seems to me like
 
03:25:10.389 --> 03:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
there's choice here refer it directly to
 
03:25:12.389 --> 03:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
an interim study
 
03:25:12.399 --> 03:25:15.030 align:start position:0%
an interim study
or

03:25:15.030 --> 03:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
put it out as a
 
03:25:16.399 --> 03:25:17.830 align:start position:0%
put it out as a
otp

03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
otp
 
03:25:20.550 --> 03:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
a and if it needs further amendments so
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
be it
 
03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:22.389 align:start position:0%
be it
but

03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
one way would actually
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
put a moratorium on
 
03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
the development of 5g until we have a
 
03:25:31.590 --> 03:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
full handle on it and by referring it
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
directly to interim study we would not
 
03:25:36.070 --> 03:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
have that moratorium so i think the
 
03:25:37.269 --> 03:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
question what it comes down to is
 
03:25:39.750 --> 03:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not we feel comfortable
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
with going ahead with a study when in
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
the end whatever we whatever the results
 
03:25:46.150 --> 03:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
of that study may already be nullified
 
03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
by what the industry's already done
 
03:25:57.750 --> 03:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:00.389 --> 03:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman uh
 
03:26:01.830 --> 03:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
i likewise
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
yes i think so
 
03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
oh it's okay
 
03:26:19.429 --> 03:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
i support the interim study motion and
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think this gives us a little
 
03:26:21.600 --> 03:26:23.670 align:start position:0%
i think this gives us a little
opportunity

03:26:23.670 --> 03:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
03:26:25.349 --> 03:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
after uh
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative ramy did such a thorough
 
03:26:29.269 --> 03:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
job with this commission and trying to
 
03:26:30.870 --> 03:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
get a handle on this
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
but for us as a committee to step back a
 
03:26:34.229 --> 03:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
03:26:34.239 --> 03:26:35.110 align:start position:0%
little bit
and

03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:26:37.190 --> 03:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
consider that there is very powerful
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
business interests involved here who are
 
03:26:41.110 --> 03:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
pushing this thing it's part of a
 
03:26:44.070 --> 03:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
marketing campaign and um
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and you know i understand that the
 
03:26:48.070 --> 03:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
department of safety is connected and so
 
03:26:50.630 --> 03:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
are emts and others who use this
 
03:26:52.870 --> 03:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
network for safety purposes
 
03:26:55.349 --> 03:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
but that's not the real business going
 
03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
on the business of of of this 5g is
 
03:27:00.389 --> 03:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
going to be broader to everybody
 
03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
and before that gets rolled out i think
 
03:27:04.150 --> 03:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be cautious and make sure
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
that the best interests of the residents
 
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire are served
 
03:27:11.030 --> 03:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i think expanding broadband which
 
03:27:13.510 --> 03:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
had huge support from both sides of the
 
03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
aisle that everyone should get
 
03:27:17.670 --> 03:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
high-speed broadband
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
this this issue with 5g seems to divert
 
03:27:22.950 --> 03:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
our attention from that and i think it
 
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
would be very beneficial if we make sure
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't get sidelined as
 
03:27:30.469 --> 03:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
part of this process thank you
 
03:27:34.229 --> 03:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:36.950 --> 03:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
i want to say that um i want to dovetail
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
a little bit on what representative
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
samsich said it's high speed
 
03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
and affordable was what
 
03:27:46.469 --> 03:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
was left out of that remark
 
03:27:49.110 --> 03:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
and i do believe and and this was my
 
03:27:50.870 --> 03:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
concern at the very
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
get-go we are not going to put a
 
03:27:56.070 --> 03:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
moratorium on anything
 
03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
we at this point
 
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
i believe do not have the authority
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
to either say yay or nay you can do it
 
03:28:05.990 --> 03:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
or you can't
 
03:28:07.910 --> 03:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we don't even have that ability
 
03:28:09.750 --> 03:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
through the puc because that was given
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
up so i think
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
i think that interim study is the best
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
way to find out how we proceed and
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
indeed if we can proceed
 
03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:19.990 align:start position:0%
indeed if we can proceed
and

03:28:19.990 --> 03:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
where we go from here and i think that
 
03:28:24.389 --> 03:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
in the meantime
 
03:28:27.190 --> 03:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
we need to educate people as to what's
 
03:28:28.550 --> 03:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:28:30.870 --> 03:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
that just that 5g
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%

my sheet okay
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
by a vote of 17 to 4 the committee will
 
03:30:36.309 --> 03:30:36.319 align:start position:0%

03:30:42.870 --> 03:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
your careful attention to this
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
complicated subject
 
03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
all the work you've done do we have a
 
03:30:48.150 --> 03:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
minority report on that
 
03:30:49.990 --> 03:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to submit a minority
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
report i think uh representative
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
minority report now before we go home i
 
03:31:01.269 --> 03:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
know everybody's anxious to get out
 
03:31:03.750 --> 03:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
there and try to beat uh potential snow
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
or rain but it's too late it's snowing
 
03:31:09.510 --> 03:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
snowing already okay all right well in
 
03:31:10.790 --> 03:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
that case why don't we just stay here
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.389 --> 03:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
so i'll tell you the story after the
 
03:31:24.229 --> 03:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:25.830 --> 03:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
before we do anything else i would like
 
03:31:28.870 --> 03:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
to solicit names uh volunteers who would
 
03:31:31.110 --> 03:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
serve on the subcommittee
 
03:31:33.750 --> 03:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
that will pursue
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
the interim study for this bill so
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%

03:31:41.110 --> 03:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative cretian
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%

representative berezni
 
03:31:59.910 --> 03:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
anyone else that's one two three four
 
03:32:02.229 --> 03:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight
 
03:32:02.239 --> 03:32:03.670 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight
um

03:32:03.670 --> 03:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:05.670 --> 03:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
that'll be a pretty good study committee
 
03:32:05.680 --> 03:32:07.190 align:start position:0%
that'll be a pretty good study committee
so

03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:08.550 --> 03:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'll look forward to putting that
 
03:32:08.560 --> 03:32:12.870 align:start position:0%
i'll look forward to putting that
together

03:32:12.870 --> 03:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:14.550 --> 03:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
no this is the
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about right now is
 
03:32:18.070 --> 03:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
the study committee
 
03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
that will
 
03:32:23.110 --> 03:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
complete the interim study of this
 
03:32:23.120 --> 03:32:24.229 align:start position:0%
complete the interim study of this
question

03:32:24.229 --> 03:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
and make a recommendation there are two
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations you can make coming out
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
of interim study
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
one is this bil this subject is not
 
03:32:35.830 --> 03:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation the
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
other is this subject is recommended for
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
future legislation and you can describe
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
what that future legislation might look
 
03:32:44.239 --> 03:32:45.429 align:start position:0%
what that future legislation might look
like

03:32:45.429 --> 03:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:32:45.439 --> 03:32:46.870 align:start position:0%
like
so

03:32:46.870 --> 03:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
this committee of eight people
 
03:32:50.469 --> 03:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
will meet
 
03:32:53.269 --> 03:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
i will choose one of you to be the chair
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
probably representative thomas
 
03:32:55.760 --> 03:32:56.710 align:start position:0%
probably representative thomas
and

03:32:56.710 --> 03:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:59.190 --> 03:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
that person will call meetings
 
03:32:59.200 --> 03:33:00.309 align:start position:0%
that person will call meetings
at

03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
his or her convenience
 
03:33:04.630 --> 03:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with in consultation with
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
the rest of the folks on the committee
 
03:33:08.070 --> 03:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
and you guys will start meeting it
 
03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
probably won't happen until
 
03:33:13.590 --> 03:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
after the close of business on may 26th
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
but it could happen before that but it
 
03:33:16.950 --> 03:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
probably won't
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
and that's because i'm the rookie here
 
03:33:23.830 --> 03:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
this interim study is dependent upon
 
03:33:25.110 --> 03:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh being approved by the full house
 
03:33:27.279 --> 03:33:28.309 align:start position:0%
uh being approved by the full house
right

03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:33:30.550 --> 03:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you just want to make
 
03:33:32.710 --> 03:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
sure okay
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
but with a vote of uh
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
17 to 4 i suspect it will be so
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm going to close the
 
03:33:42.990 --> 03:33:43.000 align:start position:0%

for this
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
